			<Question qid="0001618-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Folic acid in diet</Question>
			<Answer>Folic acid and folate are both terms for a type of B vitamin (vitamin B9). Folate is a B vitamin that occurs naturally in foods such as green leafy vegetables, citrus fruit, and beans. Folic acid is man-made (synthetic) folate. It is found in supplements and added to fortified foods. The terms folic acid and folate are often used interchangeably. Folic acid is water-soluble. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. That means your body does not store folic acid. You need to get a regular supply of the vitamin through the foods you eat or through supplements.</Answer>
