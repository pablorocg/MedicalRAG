			<Answer>A person must have at least 3 abnormal sleep-wake episodes during a 24-hour period to be diagnosed with this problem. The time between episodes is usually 1 to 4 hours. If the diagnosis is not clear, the health care provider may prescribe a device called an actigraph. The device looks like a wristwatch, and it can tell when a person is sleeping or awake. Your provider may ask you to keep a sleep diary. This is a record of what times you go to bed and wake up. The diary allows the provider to assess your sleep-wake cycle patterns.</Answer>
