			<Question qid="0000331-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Aspirin and heart disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Current guidelines recommend that people with  coronary artery disease (CAD)  receive antiplatelet therapy with either aspirin or  clopidogrel . Aspirin therapy is very helpful for people with CAD or a history of stroke. If you have been diagnosed with CAD, your health care provider may recommend that you take a daily dose (from 75 to 162 mg) of aspirin. A daily dose of 81 mg is recommended for people who have had angioplasty (also called PCI). It is most often prescribed along with another antiplatelet medicine. Aspirin can reduce the risk for heart attack and ischemic stroke. However, using aspirin over the long-term can raise your risk for stomach bleeding. Daily aspirin should not be used for prevention in healthy people who are at low risk for heart disease. You provider will consider your overall medical condition and risk factors for heart attack before recommending aspirin therapy.</Answer>
