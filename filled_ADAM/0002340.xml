			<Question qid="0002340-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Laser therapy for cancer ?</Question>
			<Answer>Laser therapy uses a very narrow, focused beam of light to shrink or destroy cancer cells. It can be used to cut out tumors without damaging other tissue. Laser therapy is often given through a thin, lighted tube that is put inside the body. Thin fibers at the end of the tube direct the light at the cancer cells. Lasers are also used on the skin.</Answer>
