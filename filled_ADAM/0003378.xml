			<Answer>All US states have a reportable diseases list. It is the responsibility of your provider, not you, to report cases of these diseases. Many diseases on the list must also be reported to the CDC. Reportable diseases are divided into several groups: Mandatory written reporting: A report of the disease must be made in writing. Examples are  gonorrhea  and  salmonellosis ., Mandatory reporting by telephone: The provider must make a report by phone. Examples are  rubeola  (measles) and  pertussis  (whooping cough)., Report of total number of cases. Examples are  chickenpox  and  influenza ., Cancer. Cancer cases are reported to the state Cancer Registry. ,  Diseases reportable to the CDC include: Anthrax , Arboviral diseases (diseases caused by viruses spread by mosquitoes, sandflies, ticks, etc.) such as  West Nile virus , eastern and western equine  encephalitis , Babesiosis,  Botulism ,  Brucellosis , Campylobacteriosis, Cancer,  Candida auris , clinical,  Candida auris , screening, Carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPO), Carbapenemase-producing organisms, clinical, Carbapenemase-producing organisms, screening,  Carbon monoxide poisoning ,  Chancroid , Chickenpox (varicella),  Chlamydia ,  Cholera ,  Coccidioidomycosis ,  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ,  Cryptosporidiosis , Cyclosporiasis, Dengue virus infections,  Diphtheria ,  Ehrlichiosis  and anaplasmosis, Foodborne disease outbreak,  Giardiasis , Gonorrhea,  Haemophilus influenza , invasive disease,  Hansen disease ,  Hantavirus infection , non-Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome,  Hemolytic uremic syndrome , post-diarrheal,  Hepatitis A ,  Hepatitis B &#160;(acute and chronic), Hepatitis B perinatal infection,  Hepatitis C  (acute and chronic), Hepatitis C, perinatal infection,  HIV/AIDS , Influenza-related infant deaths, Invasive pneumococcal disease, Lead, elevated blood level, Legionnaire disease ( legionellosis ),  Leptospirosis ,  Listeriosis ,  Lyme disease ,  Malaria , Measles, Melioidosis,  Meningitis  (meningococcal disease),  Mpox ,  Mumps , Novel influenza A virus infections, Pertussis, Pesticide-related illnesses and injuries,  Plague ,  Poliomyelitis , paralytic, Poliovirus infection, nonparalytic,  Psittacosis ,  Q-fever &#160;(acute and chronic),  Rabies  (human and animal cases),  Rubella  (including congenital syndrome),  Salmonella  paratyphi and typhi infections, Salmonellosis,  Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus disease  (SARS CoV-2), Shiga toxin-producing  Escherichia coli  (STEC),  Shigellosis ,  Silicosis ,  Smallpox , Spotted fever rickettsiosis, Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome,  Syphilis , including congenital syphilis,  Tetanus ,  Toxic shock syndrome  (other than streptococcal),  Trichinellosis ,  Tuberculosis ,  Tularemia , Vancomycin intermediate  Staphylococcus aureus  (VISA), Vancomycin resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (VRSA), Vibriosis, Viral hemorrhagic fever (including  Ebola virus , Lassa virus, among others), Waterborne disease outbreak,  Yellow fever ,  Zika virus disease  and infection (including congenital),  The county or state health department will try to find the source of many of these illnesses, such as food poisoning. In the case of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the county or state will try to locate sexual contacts of infected people to make sure they are disease-free or are treated if they are already infected. The information gained from reporting allows the county or state to make informed decisions and laws about activities and the environment, such as: Animal control, Food handling, Immunization programs, Insect control, STD tracking, Water purification ,  The provider is required by law to report these diseases. By cooperating with state health workers, you can help them locate the source of an infection or prevent the spread of an epidemic.</Answer>
