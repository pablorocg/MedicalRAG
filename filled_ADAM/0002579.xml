			<Question qid="0002579-2" qtype="causes">What causes Meningitis - H. influenzae ?</Question>
			<Answer>H influenzae  meningitis is caused by  Haemophilus influenzae  type b bacteria. This illness is not the same as the flu ( influenza ), which is caused by a virus. Before the Hib vaccine,  H influenzae  was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children under age 5. Since the vaccine became available in the United States, this type of meningitis occurs much less often in children in the United States.  H influenzae  meningitis may occur after an upper respiratory infection. The infection usually spreads from the lungs and airways to the blood, then to the brain area. Risk factors include: Attending day care,  Cancer , Ear infection ( otitis media ) with  H influenzae  infection, Family member with an  H influenzae  infection, Native American race, Pregnancy, Older age, Sinus infection ( sinusitis ), Sore throat ( pharyngitis ), Upper respiratory infection, Weakened immune system , </Answer>
