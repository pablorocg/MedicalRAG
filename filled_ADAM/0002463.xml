			<Answer>A lung positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan is an imaging test. It uses a radioactive substance (called a tracer) to look for disease in the lungs such as  lung cancer . Unlike magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and computed tomography ( CT ) scans, which reveal the structure of the lungs, a PET scan shows the activity of the cells within the lungs.</Answer>
