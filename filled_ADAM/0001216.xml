			<Question qid="0001216-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Dieffenbachia poisoning</Question>
			<Answer>Dieffenbachia is a type of house plant with large, colorful leaves. Poisoning can occur if you eat or are exposed to the leaves, stalk, or root of this plant. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
