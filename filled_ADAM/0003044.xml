			<Question qid="0003044-2" qtype="causes">What causes Pernicious anemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pernicious anemia is a type of vitamin B12 anemia. The body needs vitamin B12 to make red blood cells. You get this vitamin from eating foods such as meat, poultry, shellfish, eggs, and dairy products.  A special protein, called intrinsic factor (IF), binds vitamin B12 so that it can be absorbed in the intestines. This protein is released by cells in the stomach. When the stomach does not make enough intrinsic factor, the intestine cannot properly absorb vitamin B12. Common causes of pernicious anemia include: Weakened stomach lining (atrophic gastritis), An autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system attacks the actual intrinsic factor protein or the cells in the lining of your stomach that make it. ,  In rare cases, pernicious anemia is passed down through families. This is called congenital pernicious anemia. Babies with this type of anemia do not make enough intrinsic factor. Or they cannot properly absorb vitamin B12 in the small intestine.  In adults, symptoms of pernicious anemia are usually not seen until after age 30. The average age of diagnosis is age 60.  You are more likely to develop this disease if you: Are Scandinavian or Northern European, Have a family history of the condition ,  Certain diseases can also raise your risk. They include: Addison disease ,  Graves disease ,  Hypoparathyroidism ,  Hypothyroidism ,  Myasthenia gravis , Loss of normal function of ovaries before 40 years of age (primary ovarian failure),  Type 1 diabetes , Testicular dysfunction,  Vitiligo ,  Sj&#246;gren syndrome ,  Hashimoto disease ,  Celiac disease ,  Pernicious anemia can also occur after gastric bypass surgery.</Answer>
