			<Question qid="0004165-2" qtype="causes">What causes Uveitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Uveitis can be caused by  autoimmune disorders . These diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. Examples are: Ankylosing spondylitis , Behcet disease,  Psoriasis , Reactive arthritis,  Rheumatoid arthritis ,  Sarcoidosis ,  Ulcerative colitis ,  Uveitis can also be caused by infections such as: AIDS , Cytomegalovirus ( CMV) retinitis ,  Herpes zoster infection ,  Histoplasmosis ,  Kawasaki disease ,  Syphilis ,  Toxoplasmosis ,  Exposure to toxins or injury can also cause uveitis. In many cases, the cause is unknown. Often the inflammation is limited to only part of the uvea. The most common form of uveitis involves inflammation of the iris, in the front part of the eye. In this case, the condition is called iritis. In most cases, it occurs in healthy people. The disorder may affect only one eye. It is most common in young and middle-aged people. Posterior uveitis affects the back part of the eye. It involves primarily the choroid. This is the layer of blood vessels and connective tissue in the middle layer of the eye. This type of uveitis is called choroiditis. If the retina is also involved, it is called chorioretinitis. Another form of uveitis is pars planitis. Inflammation occurs in the area called the pars plana, which is located between the iris and the choroid. Pars planitis most often occurs in young men. It is generally not associated with any other disease. However, it may be linked to Crohn disease and possibly multiple sclerosis.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004165-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Uveitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The health care provider will take a complete medical history and do an eye exam. Lab tests may be done to rule out infection or a weak immune system. If you are over age 25 and have pars planitis, your provider will suggest a brain and spine MRI. This will rule out multiple sclerosis.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004165-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Uveitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Iritis and irido-cyclitis (anterior uveitis) are most often mild. Treatment may involve: 
   Dark glasses
   , 
   Eye drops that dilate the pupil to relieve pain
   , 
   Steroid eye drops
   ,  Pars planitis is often treated with steroid eye drops. Other medicines, including steroids taken by mouth, may be used to help suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. Posterior uveitis treatment depends on the underlying cause. It almost always includes steroids taken by mouth. If the uveitis is caused by a body-wide (systemic) infection, you may be given antibiotics. You may also be given powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids. Sometimes certain types of immune-suppressant drugs are used to treat severe uveitis.</Answer>
