			<Question qid="0002972-2" qtype="causes">What causes Pathological gambling ?</Question>
			<Answer>Compulsive gambling most often begins in early adolescence in men, and between ages 20 and 40 in women. People with compulsive gambling have a hard time resisting or controlling the impulse to gamble. The brain is reacting to this impulse in the same manner it reacts to a person addicted to alcohol or drugs. Although it shares features of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), compulsive gambling is likely a different condition. In people who develop compulsive gambling, occasional gambling leads to a gambling habit. Stressful situations can worsen gambling problems.</Answer>
