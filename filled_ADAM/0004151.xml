			<Answer>It is important to start walking soon after a leg injury or surgery. But you will need support while your leg is healing. A walker can give you support as you start to walk again. There are many types of walkers. Walkers may have no wheels, 2 wheels, or 4 wheels., You can also get a walker with brakes, a carrying basket, and a sitting bench., Any walker you use should be easy to fold so that you can transport it easily.,  Your surgeon or physical therapist will help you choose the type of walker that is best for you.</Answer>
