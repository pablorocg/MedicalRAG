			<Question qid="0002082-2" qtype="considerations">What to do for Hypermobile joints ?</Question>
			<Answer>Children's joints are often more flexible than adults' joints. But children with hypermobile joints can flex and extend their joints beyond what is considered normal. The movement is done without too much force and without discomfort. Thick bands of tissue called ligaments help hold joints together and keep them from moving too much or too far. In children with hypermobility syndrome, those ligaments are loose or weak. This may lead to: Arthritis, which may develop over time, usually many years, Dislocated joints, which is a separation of two bones where they meet at a joint, Sprains and strains ,  Children with hypermobile joints also often have flat feet.</Answer>
