			<Question qid="0001078-2" qtype="considerations">What to do for Cyst ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cysts may form within any tissue in the body. Most cysts in the lungs are filled with air. Cysts that form in the  lymph system  or kidneys are fluid-filled. Certain parasites, such as some types of roundworms and tapeworms, can form cysts within the muscles, liver, brain, lungs, and eyes. Cysts are common on the skin. They can develop when  acne  causes a sebaceous gland to clog, or they can form around something that is stuck in the skin. These cysts are not cancer (benign), but can cause pain and changes in appearance. At times, they can become infected and need treatment due to pain and swelling. Cysts can be drained or removed with surgery, depending on their type and location. Sometimes, a cyst looks like a skin cancer and may need to be removed to be tested. A  pilonidal dimple  or cyst is a type of skin cyst at the top of the buttocks in the midline of the body.</Answer>
