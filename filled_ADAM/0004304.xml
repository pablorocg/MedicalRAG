			<Question qid="0004304-1" qtype="information">What is (are) When you pass your due date ?</Question>
			<Answer>Most pregnancies last 37 to 42 weeks, but some take longer. If your pregnancy lasts more than 42 weeks, it is called post-term (past due). This happens in a small number of pregnancies. While there are some risks in a post-term pregnancy, most post-term babies are born healthy. Your health care provider can do special tests to check on the health of your baby. Keeping a close eye on the baby's health will help increase the chance of good outcomes.</Answer>
