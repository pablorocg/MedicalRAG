			<Question qid="0000381-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Babinski reflex ?</Question>
			<Answer>Reflexes are responses that occur when the body receives a certain stimulus. The Babinski reflex occurs after the sole of the foot has been firmly stroked. The big toe then moves upward or toward the top surface of the foot. The other toes fan out. Babinski reflex is one of the normal reflexes in infants and in children up to 2 years old. It disappears as the child gets older. It may disappear as early as 12 months. In adults, this reflex is not normal and often indicates a problem with the brain or spinal cord.</Answer>
