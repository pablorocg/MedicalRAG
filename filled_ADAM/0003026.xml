			<Question qid="0003026-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Peripheral artery bypass - leg</Question>
			<Answer>Peripheral artery bypass is surgery to reroute the blood supply around a  blocked artery in one of your legs . Fatty deposits can build up inside the arteries and block them. A graft is used to replace or bypass the blocked part of the artery. The graft may be a plastic tube, or it may be a blood vessel (vein) taken from your body (most often the opposite leg) during the same surgery.</Answer>
