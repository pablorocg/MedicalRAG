			<Question qid="0001123-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Delivery presentations ?</Question>
			<Answer>Delivery presentation describes the way the baby is positioned to come down the birth canal for delivery. Your baby must pass through your pelvic bones to reach the vaginal opening. The ease at which this passage will take place depends on how your baby is positioned during delivery. The best position for the baby to be in to pass through the pelvis is with the head down and the body facing towards the mother's back. This position is called occiput anterior (OA). In breech position, the baby's bottom is facing down instead of the head. Your health care provider will most often detect this in an office visit before your labor begins. Most babies will be in the head-down position by about 34 weeks. Part of your prenatal care after 34 weeks will involve making sure your baby is in the head-down position. If your baby is breech, it is not safe to deliver vaginally. If your baby is not in a head-down position after your 36th week, your provider can explain  your choices and their risks  to help you decide what steps to take next.</Answer>
