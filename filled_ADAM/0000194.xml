			<Question qid="0000194-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Ammonium hydroxide poisoning</Question>
			<Answer>Ammonium hydroxide is a colorless liquid chemical solution. It is in a class of substances called caustics. Ammonium hydroxide forms when ammonia dissolves in water. This article discusses poisoning from ammonium hydroxide. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
