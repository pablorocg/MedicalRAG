			<Question qid="0002611-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Metal cleaner poisoning</Question>
			<Answer>Metal cleaners are very strong chemical products that contain acids. This article discusses poisoning from swallowing or breathing in such products. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
