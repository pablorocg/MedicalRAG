			<Answer>Women normally produce low levels of male hormones (androgens). If your body makes too much of this hormone, you may have unwanted hair growth. In most cases, the exact cause is never known. The condition often runs in families. A common cause of hirsutism is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS and other hormone conditions that cause unwanted hair growth may also have:  Acne, Problems with menstrual periods, Trouble losing weight, Diabetes ,  If these symptoms start suddenly, you may have a tumor that releases male hormones.
