			<Question qid="0002138-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Ileostomy and your diet</Question>
			<Answer>You had an injury or disease in your digestive system and needed an operation called an ileostomy. The operation changed the way your body gets rid of waste (stool, feces, or poop). Now you have an opening called a stoma in your belly. Waste will pass through the stoma into a pouch that collects it. You will need to take care of the stoma and empty the pouch several times a day. People who have had an ileostomy can most often eat a normal diet. But some foods may cause problems. Foods that may be fine for some people may cause trouble for others.</Answer>
