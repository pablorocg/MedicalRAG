			<Question qid="0002470-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Lupus anticoagulants and antiphospholipid antibodies</Question>
			<Answer>Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder that involves frequent blood clots (thromboses). When you have this condition, your body's immune system makes abnormal proteins that attack the blood cells and lining of the blood vessels. The presence of these  antibodies  can cause problems with blood flow and lead to dangerous clots in blood vessels throughout the body.</Answer>
