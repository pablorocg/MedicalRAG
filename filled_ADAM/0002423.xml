			<Question qid="0002423-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Living with vision loss ?</Question>
			<Answer>Low vision is a visual disability. Wearing regular glasses or contacts does not help. People with low vision have already tried the available medical or surgical treatments. And no other treatments will help. If you have been told that you will go totally blind or to the point where you can't see well enough to read, it may be helpful to learn Braille while you are still able to see. People with vision worse than 20/200, with glasses or contact lenses, are considered legally blind in most states in the United States. But many people in this group still have some useful vision. When you have low vision, you may have trouble driving, reading, or doing small tasks like sewing and crafts. But you can make changes in your home and in your routines that help you stay safe and independent. Some of these methods and techniques require at least some vision so will not be helpful for total blindness. Many services are available for you to get the training and support to function independently. One of these is the  Braille Institute of America .</Answer>
