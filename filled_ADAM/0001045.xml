			<Question qid="0001045-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Cryoglobulins</Question>
			<Answer>Cryoglobulins are antibodies that become solid or gel-like at low temperatures in the laboratory. This article describes the blood test used to check for them. In the laboratory, cryoglobulins come out of solution in blood when the blood sample is cooled below 98.6&#176;F (37&#176;C). They dissolve again when the sample is warmed up. Cryoglobulins come in three main types, but in most cases the cause of having cryoglobulins is  hepatitis C . The disease in which cryoglobulins are found is called  cryoglobulinemia . Cryoglobulins can cause inflammation in blood vessels, called vasculitis. They may also cause inflammation in the kidney, nerves, joints, lungs and skin.</Answer>
