			<Question qid="0001791-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Hair dye poisoning</Question>
			<Answer>Hair dye poisoning occurs when someone swallows dye or tint used to color hair.  This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
