			<Question qid="0000145-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Alcoholic neuropathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>Stopping the use of alcohol is the most important first step. People will often need counseling from alcohol use disorder specialists. If there are other medical problems that can also cause nerve damage, such as diabetes, they should be treated as well. Once the alcohol problem has been addressed, treatment goals include: Controlling symptoms, Maximizing ability to function independently, Preventing injury ,  It is important to supplement the diet with vitamins, including thiamine and folic acid. Physical therapy and orthopedic appliances (such as splints) may be needed to maintain muscle function and limb position. Medicines may be needed to treat pain or uncomfortable sensations due to nerve damage. They will be prescribed the smallest dose of medicine needed to reduce symptoms. This may help prevent drug dependence and other side effects of  chronic  use. Positioning or the use of a bed frame that keeps the covers off the legs may help reduce pain. People with lightheadedness or dizziness when standing up (orthostatic hypotension) may need to try several different treatments before finding one that successfully reduces their symptoms. Treatments that may help include: Wearing  compression stockings , Eating extra salt, Sleeping with the head elevated, Using medicines ,  Bladder problems may be treated with: Manual expression of urine, Intermittent catheterization ( male  or  female ), Medicines ,  Impotence, diarrhea, constipation, or other symptoms are treated when necessary. These symptoms often respond poorly to treatment in people with alcoholic neuropathy. It is important to protect body parts with reduced sensation from injury. This may include: Checking the temperature of bath water to prevent burns, Changing footwear, Frequently inspecting the feet and shoes to reduce injury caused by pressure or objects in the shoes, Guarding the extremities to prevent injury from pressure ,  Alcohol must be stopped to prevent the damage from getting worse. Treatment for alcoholism may include counseling, social support such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), or medicines.</Answer>
