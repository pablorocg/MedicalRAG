			<Question qid="0002767-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Neonatal hypothyroidism ?</Question>

			<Question qid="0002767-2" qtype="causes">What causes Neonatal hypothyroidism ?</Question>
			<Answer>The thyroid gland is an important organ of the  endocrine system . It is located at the front of the neck, just above where the collarbones meet. The thyroid makes hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is called  metabolism . Hypothyroidism in the newborn may be caused by: A missing or poorly developed thyroid gland, A pituitary gland that does not stimulate the thyroid gland, Thyroid hormones that are poorly formed or do not work, Medicines the mother took during pregnancy, Lack of iodine in the mother's diet during pregnancy,  Antibodies  made by the mother's body that block the baby's thyroid function,  A thyroid gland that is not fully developed is the most common defect. Girls are affected twice as often as boys.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002767-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Neonatal hypothyroidism ?</Question>

			<Question qid="0002767-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Neonatal hypothyroidism ?</Question>
			<Answer>Early diagnosis is very important. Most of the effects of hypothyroidism are easy to reverse. For this reason, most US states require that all newborns be screened for hypothyroidism. Thyroxine is usually given to treat hypothyroidism. Once the child starts taking this medicine, blood tests are regularly done to make sure thyroid hormone levels are in a normal range. Referral to a pediatric endocrinologist is recommended for care.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002767-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Neonatal hypothyroidism ?</Question>
			<Answer>Getting diagnosed early usually leads to a good outcome. Newborns diagnosed and treated in the first month or so usually have normal intelligence. Untreated mild hypothyroidism can lead to severe  intellectual disability  and growth problems. The nervous system goes through important development during the first few months after birth. Lack of thyroid hormones can cause damage that cannot be reversed.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002767-8" qtype="prevention">How to prevent Neonatal hypothyroidism ?</Question>
			<Answer>If a pregnant woman takes radioactive iodine for thyroid cancer, the thyroid gland may be destroyed in the developing fetus. Infants whose mothers have taken such medicines should be observed carefully after birth for signs of hypothyroidism.&#160;Also, pregnant women should not avoid iodine-supplemented salt. Most states require a routine  screening test  to check all newborns for hypothyroidism.&#160;If your state does not have this requirement, ask your provider if your newborn should be screened.</Answer>
