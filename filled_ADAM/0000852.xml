			<Question qid="0000852-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Chylomicronemia syndrome ?</Question>

			<Question qid="0000852-2" qtype="causes">What causes Chylomicronemia syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Chylomicronemia syndrome can occur due to a rare genetic disorder in which a protein (enzyme) called lipoprotein lipase (LpL) is broken or missing. It can also be caused by the absence of second factor called apo C-II, which activates LpL. LpL is normally found in fat and muscle. It helps break down certain lipids. When LpL is missing or broken, fat particles called chylomicrons build up in the blood. This buildup is called chylomicronemia. Defects in apolipoprotein CII and apolipoprotein AV can cause the syndrome as well. It is more likely to occur when people who are predisposed to have high triglycerides (such as those who have  familial combined hyperlipidemia  or  familial hypertriglyceridemia ) develop diabetes, obesity or are exposed to certain medicines.</Answer>
