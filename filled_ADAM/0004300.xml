			<Answer>Diarrhea is the passage of loose or watery stool. For some, diarrhea is mild and will go away within a few days. For others, it may last longer. It can make you lose too much fluid (dehydrated) and feel weak. It can also lead to unhealthy weight loss. A  stomach or intestinal illness  is a common cause of diarrhea. Medical treatments, such as antibiotics and some cancer treatments can also cause diarrhea. Many other medicines can also cause diarrhea.</Answer>
