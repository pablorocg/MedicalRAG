			<Question qid="0001904-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Hemodialysis access - self care ?</Question>
			<Answer>Vascular access (often called just "access") is needed for you to get  hemodialysis . Using the access, blood is removed from your body, cleaned by a dialyzer, then returned to your body. Usually the access is put in a person's arm. But it can also go in your leg. Depending on the type of access, it takes a few weeks to a few months to get an access ready for hemodialysis. Taking good care of your access helps make it last longer.</Answer>
