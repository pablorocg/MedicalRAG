			<Question qid="0000814-2" qtype="causes">What causes Cholera ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cholera is caused by the bacteria  Vibrio cholerae . These bacteria release a toxin that causes an increased amount of water to be released from cells that line the intestines. This increase in water produces severe diarrhea. People develop the infection from eating or drinking food or water that contains the cholera germ. Living in or traveling to areas where cholera is present raises the risk of getting it. Cholera occurs in places with a lack of water treatment or sewage treatment, or crowding, war, and famine. Common locations for cholera include: Africa, Some parts of Asia, India, Bangladesh, Mexico, South and Central America , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000814-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Cholera ?</Question>
			<Answer>The goal of treatment is to replace fluid and salts that are lost through diarrhea. Diarrhea and fluid loss can be fast and extreme. It can be hard to replace lost fluids.  Depending on your condition, you may be given fluids by mouth or through a vein ( intravenous , or IV). Antibiotics may shorten the time you feel ill.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed packets of salts that are mixed with clean water to help restore fluids. These are cheaper and easier to use than the typical IV fluid. These packets are now being used around the world.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000814-9" qtype="prevention">How to prevent Cholera ?</Question>
			<Answer>There is a cholera vaccine available for adults ages 18 to 64 who are traveling to an area with an active cholera outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend the cholera vaccine for most travelers because most people do not travel to areas where cholera is present. Travelers should always be careful when eating food and drinking water, even if they are vaccinated. When outbreaks of cholera occur, efforts should be made to establish clean water, food, and sanitation. Vaccination is not very effective in managing outbreaks.</Answer>
