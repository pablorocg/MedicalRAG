			<Question qid="0003727-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Stonefish sting</Question>
			<Answer>Stonefish are members of the family Scorpaenidae, or scorpion fish. The family also includes zebrafish and lionfish. These fishes are very good at hiding in their surroundings. The fins of these prickly fishes carry toxic venom. This article describes the effects of a sting from this kind of fish. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual stonefish sting. If you or someone you are with is stung, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
