			<Question qid="0000895-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Cold wave lotion poisoning ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cold wave lotion is a hair care product used to create permanent waves ("a perm"). Cold wave lotion poisoning occurs from swallowing, breathing in, or touching the lotion. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000895-8" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Cold wave lotion poisoning ?</Question>
			<Answer>How well someone does depends on the amount of poison swallowed or otherwise exposed to and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Skin problems will clear up when use of the product is stopped. If the lotion is swallowed, recovery normally occurs if the right treatment is received in time. Most home permanent kits that contain cold wave lotions are watered down to avoid poisoning. However, some hair salons may use stronger forms that need to be diluted before use. Exposure to this stronger cold wave lotion will cause much more damage than the ones used at home.</Answer>
