			<Question qid="0003144-2" qtype="causes">What causes Polyarteritis nodosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>Arteries are the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to organs and tissues. The cause of polyarteritis nodosa is unknown. The condition occurs when certain immune cells attack the affected arteries. The tissues that are fed by the affected arteries do not get the oxygen and nourishment they need. Damage occurs as a result. More adults than children get this disease.  People with active  hepatitis B  or  hepatitis C  may develop this disease.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003144-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Polyarteritis nodosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>No specific lab tests are available to diagnose polyarteritis nodosa. There are a number of disorders that have features similar to polyarteritis nodosa. These are known as "mimics." You will have a complete physical exam. Lab tests that can help make the diagnosis and rule out mimics include: Complete blood count  (CBC) with differential, creatinine, tests for hepatitis B and C, and urinalysis,  Erythrocyte sedimentation rate  (ESR) or  C-reactive protein  (CRP), Serum protein electrophoresis, cryoglobulins, Serum complement levels,  Arteriogram , Tissue  biopsy , Other blood tests will be done to rule out similar conditions, such as  systemic lupus erythematosus  (ANA) or  granulomatosis with polyangiitis  (ANCA),  Test for HIV , Test for hepatitis B and hepatitis C ,  Cryoglobulins , Anti-phospholipid antibodies,  Blood cultures , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003144-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Polyarteritis nodosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment involves medicines to suppress inflammation and the immune system. These may include steroids, such as prednisone. Similar medicines, such as azathioprine, methotrexate or mycophenolate that allow for reducing the dose of steroids are often used as well. Cyclophosphamide is used in severe cases. For polyarteritis nodosa related to hepatitis, treatment may involve plasmapheresis and antiviral medicines.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003144-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Polyarteritis nodosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>Current treatments with steroids and other drugs that suppress the immune system (such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide) can improve symptoms and the chance of long-term survival.  The most serious complications most often involve the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract.  Without treatment, the outlook is poor.</Answer>
