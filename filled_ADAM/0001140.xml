			<Answer>Plaque is a soft and sticky substance that collects around and between teeth. The home dental plaque identification test shows where plaque builds up. This helps you know how well you are brushing and flossing your teeth. Plaque is the major cause of  tooth decay  and gum disease ( gingivitis ). It is hard to see with the naked eye because it is whitish colored, like teeth.</Answer>
