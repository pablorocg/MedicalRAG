			<Question qid="0000261-7" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Anti-reflux surgery - children ?</Question>
			<Answer>Heartburn and related symptoms should improve after anti-reflux surgery. However, your child may still need to take medicines for heartburn after surgery. Some children may need another operation in the future to treat new reflux symptoms or swallowing problems. This may happen if the stomach was wrapped around the esophagus too tightly or it loosens. The surgery may not be successful if the repair was too loose.</Answer>
