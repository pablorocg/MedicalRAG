			<Question qid="0004209-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Venogram - leg</Question>
			<Answer>Venography for legs is a test used to see the veins in the leg. X-rays  are a form of electromagnetic radiation, like visible light is. However, these rays are of higher energy. Therefore, they can go through the body to form an image on film. Structures that are dense (such as bone) will appear white, air will be black, and other structures will be shades of gray. Veins are not normally seen in an x-ray, so a special dye is used to highlight them. This dye is called contrast.</Answer>
