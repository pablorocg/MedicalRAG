These may include: Anemia , Decreased oxygen ( hypoxia ),  Heart failure , High carbon dioxide levels ( hypercapnia ), Infections,  Kidney failure , Liver failure, Nutritional disorders, Psychiatric conditions (such as depression or psychosis), Thyroid disorders ,  Treating medical and mental disorders often greatly improves mental function.
