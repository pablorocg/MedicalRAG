			<Question qid="0000675-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Capsule endoscopy</Question>
			<Answer>Endoscopy is a way of looking inside the body.  Endoscopy  is often done with a tube put into the body that the doctor can use to look inside.  Another way to look inside is to put a camera in a capsule (capsule endoscopy). This capsule includes one or two tiny cameras, a light bulb, a battery, and a radio transmitter.  It is about the size of a large vitamin pill. The person swallows the capsule, and it takes pictures all the way through the digestive (gastrointestinal) tract.  The radio transmitter sends the photos to a recorder the person wears on their waist or shoulder., A technician downloads the photos from the recorder to a computer, and the health care provider looks at them., The camera comes out with a bowel movement and is flushed down the toilet safely. , </Answer>
