			<Question qid="0002184-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Inflatable artificial sphincter</Question>
			<Answer>Sphincters in the urinary system are muscles that allow your body to hold in urine. An inflatable artificial (man-made) sphincter is a medical device. This device keeps urine from leaking. It is used when your urinary sphincter no longer works well. When you need to urinate, the cuff of the artificial sphincter can be relaxed. This allows urine to flow out. Other procedures to treat urine leakage and incontinence include: Tension-free vaginal tape  (midurethral sling) and autologous sling (women),  Urethral bulking with artificial material  (men and women),  Retropubic suspension  (women), Male urethral sling (men), </Answer>
