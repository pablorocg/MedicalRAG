			<Question qid="0002942-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Para-aminobenzoic acid</Question>
			<Answer>Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a natural substance. It is often used in sunscreen products. PABA is sometimes called vitamin Bx, but it is not a true vitamin. This article discusses reactions to PABA, such as  overdose  and allergic response. PABA overdose occurs when someone uses more than the normal or recommended amount of this substance. This can be by accident or on purpose. Increased outdoor leisure time, decreased clothing coverage, a diminishing stratospheric ozone layer, and the rise in popularity of indoor tanning have added up to a significant increase in ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure in the last century. When used appropriately, PABA-containing products can reduce the incidence of several types of skin cancers by reducing the amount of harmful radiation which can act upon the skin. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose . If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
