			<Question qid="0000110-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Agammaglobulinemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Agammaglobulinemia is an inherited disorder in which a person has very low levels of protective immune system proteins called immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins are a type of  antibody . Low levels of these antibodies make you more likely to get infections.</Answer>
	</QAPair>

			<Question qid="0000110-2" qtype="causes">What causes Agammaglobulinemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>This is a rare disorder that mainly affects males. It is caused by a gene defect that blocks the growth of normal, mature immune cells called B lymphocytes. As a result, the body makes very little (if any) immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins play a major role in the  immune response , which protects against illness and infection. People with this disorder develop infections again and again. Common infections include ones that are due to bacteria such as  Haemophilus influenzae , pneumococci ( Streptococcus pneumoniae ), and staphylococci. Common sites of infection include: Gastrointestinal tract, Joints, Lungs, Skin, Upper  respiratory  tract ,  Agammaglobulinemia is inherited, which means other people in your family may have the condition.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000110-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Agammaglobulinemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>The disorder is confirmed by blood tests that measure levels of immunoglobulins. Tests include: Flow cytometry to measure circulating B lymphocytes,  Immunoelectrophoresis - serum ,  Quantitative immunoglobulins  - IgG, IgA, IgM (usually measured by nephelometry) , </Answer>
	</QAPair>
	<QAPair pid="5">
			<Question qid="0000110-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Agammaglobulinemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment involves taking steps to reduce the number and severity of infections. Antibiotics are often needed to treat bacterial infections. Immunoglobulins are given through a vein or by injection to boost the immune system. A bone marrow transplant may be considered.</Answer>

	<QAPair pid="6">
			<Question qid="0000110-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Agammaglobulinemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment with immunoglobulins has greatly improved the health of those who have this disorder.  Without treatment, most severe infections are deadly.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000110-8" qtype="when to contact a medical professional">Do I need to see a doctor for Agammaglobulinemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Contact your health care provider for an appointment if: You or your child has experienced frequent infections., You have a family history of agammaglobulinemia or another immunodeficiency disorder and you are planning to have children. Ask the provider about genetic counseling., </Answer>
	</QAPair>
	<QAPair pid="9">
			<Question qid="0000110-9" qtype="prevention">How to prevent Agammaglobulinemia ?</Question>
