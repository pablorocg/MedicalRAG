			<Question qid="0003789-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Suprapubic catheter care</Question>
			<Answer>A suprapubic catheter (tube) drains urine from your bladder. It is inserted into your bladder through a small hole in your lower belly. You may need a catheter because you have urinary incontinence (leakage), urinary retention (not being able to urinate), surgery that made a catheter necessary, or another health problem.</Answer>
