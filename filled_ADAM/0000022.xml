			<Answer>
Choking is when someone is having a very hard time breathing because food, a toy, or other object is blocking the throat or windpipe (airway). A choking person's airway may be blocked so that not enough oxygen reaches the lungs. Without oxygen, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 to 6 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save a person's life. Abdominal thrusts is an emergency technique to help clear someone's airway. The procedure is done on someone who is  choking and also conscious ., Most experts do not recommend abdominal thrusts for infants less than 1 year old., You can also perform the maneuver on&#160; yourself ., </Answer>
