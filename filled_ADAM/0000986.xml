			<Question qid="0000986-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Cor pulmonale ?</Question>

			<Question qid="0000986-2" qtype="causes">What causes Cor pulmonale ?</Question>
			<Answer>High blood pressure  in the arteries of the lungs is called  pulmonary hypertension . It is the most common cause of cor pulmonale. In people who have pulmonary hypertension, changes in the small blood vessels inside the lungs can lead to increased blood pressure in the right side of the heart. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the lungs. If this high pressure continues, it puts a strain on the right side of the heart. That strain can cause cor pulmonale. Lung conditions that cause a low blood oxygen level in the blood over a long time can also lead to cor pulmonale. Some of these are: Autoimmune diseases  that damage the lungs, such as  scleroderma ,  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD), Chronic blood clots in the lungs,  Cystic fibrosis  (CF),  Severe bronchiectasis &#160; , Scarring of the lung tissue ( interstitial lung disease ), Severe curving of the upper part of the spine ( kyphoscoliosis ),  Obstructive sleep apnea , which causes stops in breathing because of airway inflammation, Idiopathic (no specific cause) tightening (constriction) of the blood vessels of the lungs, Severe left-sided heart failure, </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000986-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Cor pulmonale ?</Question>
			<Answer>The goal of treatment is to control symptoms. It is important to treat medical problems that cause pulmonary hypertension, because they can lead to cor pulmonale. Many treatment options are available. In general, the cause of your cor pulmonale will determine which treatment you receive.  If your&#160;provider prescribes medicines, you may take them by mouth (oral), receive them through a vein (intravenous or IV), or breathe them in (inhaled).

Other treatments may include: Blood thinners to reduce the risk of blood clots,  Medicines to manage heart failure symptoms , Oxygen therapy at home (as in most cases of cor pulmonale, oxygen is low), A lung or heart-lung transplant, if medicine does not work ,  Important tips to follow: Avoid strenuous activities and heavy lifting., Avoid traveling to high altitudes., Get a yearly  flu vaccine , as well as other vaccines, such as the&#160; pneumonia vaccine , and the  COVID vaccine ., If you smoke, stop., Limit how much salt you eat.
