			<Question qid="0004351-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Zinc oxide overdose</Question>
			<Answer>Zinc oxide is an ingredient in many products. Some of these are certain creams and ointments used to prevent or treat minor skin burns and irritation. Zinc oxide overdose occurs when someone eats one of these products. This can be by accident or on purpose. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual  overdose . If you or someone you are with has an exposure or swallows it, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
