			<Question qid="0003808-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Sweetened beverages</Question>
			<Answer>Many sweetened drinks are high in calories and can cause weight gain, even in active people. If you feel like drinking something sweet, try to choose a beverage that is made with non-nutritive (or sugar-free) sweeteners. You can also add flavor to plain water or seltzer with fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs, or a splash of juice.</Answer>
