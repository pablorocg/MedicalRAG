			<Question qid="0002235-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about IQ testing</Question>
			<Answer>Many IQ tests are used today. Whether they measure actual intelligence or simply certain abilities&#160;is controversial. IQ tests measure a specific functioning ability and may not accurately assess a person's talents or future potential. Results of any intelligence test may be culturally biased. The more widely used tests include: Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, Differential Ability Scales, Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children,  Functioning abilities that are measured by these tests include language, mathematical, analytical, spatial (for example, reading a map), among others. Each test has its own scoring system.  In general, IQ tests are only one way to measure how well a person functions. Other factors, such as genetics and environment, should be considered.</Answer>
