			<Question qid="0000702-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Carpal tunnel syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition in which there is excessive pressure on the median nerve at the wrist. This is the nerve that allows feeling and movement to parts of the hand. Carpal tunnel syndrome can lead to pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, or muscle damage in the hand and fingers.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000702-2" qtype="causes">What causes Carpal tunnel syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>The median nerve typically provides feeling and movement to the thumb side of the hand. This includes the palm, thumb, index finger, middle finger, and thumb side of the ring finger. The area in your wrist where the nerve enters the hand is called the carpal tunnel. This tunnel is normally narrow. A thick ligament (tissue) just under your skin (the carpal ligament) makes up the top of this tunnel. Any swelling can pinch the nerve and cause pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness. This is called carpal tunnel syndrome. Some people who develop carpal tunnel syndrome were born with a small carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel syndrome can also be caused by making the same hand and wrist motion over and over. Using hand tools that vibrate may also lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Studies have not proved that carpal tunnel is caused by typing on a computer, using a mouse, or repeating movements while working, playing a musical instrument, or playing sports. But, these activities may cause tendinitis or bursitis in the hand, which can narrow the carpal tunnel and lead to symptoms. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs most often in people ages 30 to 60. It is more common in women than men. Other factors that may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome include: Alcohol use ,  Bone fractures  and arthritis of the wrist,  Cyst  or tumor that grows in the wrist, Infections,  Obesity , Extra fluids retained during pregnancy or  menopause ,  Rheumatoid arthritis , Diseases that have abnormal deposits of protein in the body ( amyloidosis ) , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000702-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Carpal tunnel syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>During a physical exam, your health care provider may find: Numbness in the palm, thumb, index finger, middle finger, and thumb side of your ring finger (some people have variations in the location of numbness), Weak hand grip, Tapping over the median nerve at your wrist may cause pain to shoot from your wrist to your hand (this is called the Tinel sign), Bending your wrist forward all the way for 60 seconds will usually result in numbness, tingling, or weakness (this is called the Phalen test) , Difficulty in identifying two points along the fingers ,  Tests that may be ordered include: Wrist x-rays  to check for other problems, such as arthritis in your wrist,  Electromyography  (EMG, a test to check muscles and the nerves that control them),  Nerve conduction velocity  (a test to see how fast electrical signals move through a nerve) , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000702-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Carpal tunnel syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Your provider may suggest that you: Wear a splint at night for several weeks.

Your provider may suggest an occupational therapist., Making changes in your work duties or home and sports activities. Some of the jobs linked with carpal tunnel syndrome include those that involve vibrating tools. ,  MEDICINES Medicines used to treat carpal tunnel syndrome include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or naproxen. Corticosteroid injections can be given into the carpal tunnel area to relieve symptoms. SURGERY Carpal tunnel release  is a surgical procedure that cuts into the ligament that is pressing on the nerve. Surgery is successful most of the time but depends on how long you've had the nerve compression and its severity.</Answer>
