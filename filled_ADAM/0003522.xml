			<Question qid="0003522-3" qtype="causes">What causes Sensorineural deafness ?</Question>
			<Answer>The inner part of the ear contains tiny hair cells (nerve endings), that change sounds into electric signals. The nerves then carry these signals to the brain. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is caused by damage to these special cells, or to the nerve fibers in the inner ear. Sometimes, the hearing loss is caused by damage to the nerve that carries the signals to the brain. Sensorineural deafness that is present at birth (congenital) is most often due to: Genetic syndromes, Infections that the mother passes to her baby in the womb ( toxoplasmosis ,  rubella ,  herpes ),  SNHL may develop in children or adults later in life (acquired) as a result of: Age-related hearing loss , Disease of the blood vessels, Immune disease, Infections, such as  meningitis ,  mumps ,  scarlet fever , and  measles , Injury of the ear or head, Loud noises or sounds, or  loud sounds that last for a long time ,  Meniere disease , Tumor, such as  acoustic neuroma , Use of certain medicines, Working around loud noises every day,  In some cases, the cause is unknown.</Answer>
