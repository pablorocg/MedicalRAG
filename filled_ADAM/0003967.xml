			<Question qid="0003967-2" qtype="causes">What causes Tooth abscess ?</Question>
			<Answer>A tooth abscess may form if there is  tooth decay . It may also occur when a tooth is broken, chipped, or injured in other ways. Openings in the tooth enamel allow bacteria to infect the center of the tooth (the pulp). Infection may spread from the root of the tooth to the bones supporting the tooth. Infection results in a buildup of pus and tissue swelling within the tooth. This causes a  toothache . The toothache may stop if pressure is relieved. But the infection will remain active and continue to spread. This will cause more pain and can destroy tissue.</Answer>
