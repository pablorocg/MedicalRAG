			<Question qid="0000887-2" qtype="causes">What causes Cocaine withdrawal ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cocaine produces a sense of euphoria (extreme mood elevation) by causing the brain to release higher than normal amounts of some chemicals. But, cocaine's effects on other parts of the body can be very serious, or even deadly. When cocaine use is stopped or when a binge ends, a crash follows almost right away. The cocaine user has a strong craving for more cocaine during a crash. Other symptoms include fatigue, lack of pleasure, anxiety, irritability, sleepiness, and sometimes agitation or extreme suspicion or paranoia. Cocaine withdrawal often has no visible physical symptoms, such as the vomiting and shaking that accompany withdrawal from heroin or alcohol.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000887-7" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Cocaine withdrawal ?</Question>
			<Answer> Cocaine addiction is difficult to treat, and relapse can occur. Treatment should start with the least restrictive option. Outpatient care is as effective as inpatient care for most people. Withdrawal from cocaine may not be as unstable as withdrawal from alcohol. However, the withdrawal from any chronic substance use can be very serious. There is a risk of suicide or overdose. People who have cocaine withdrawal will often use alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, or anti-anxiety medicines to treat their symptoms. Long-term use of these drugs is not recommended because it simply shifts addiction from one substance to another. Under proper medical supervision, however, short-term use of these medicines may be helpful in recovery. Presently, there are no medicines to reduce craving, but research is ongoing.</Answer>
