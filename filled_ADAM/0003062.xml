			<Question qid="0003062-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Pheniramine overdose</Question>
			<Answer>Pheniramine is a type of medicine called an antihistamine. It helps relieve allergy symptoms. Pheniramine overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine, either by accident or on purpose. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual  overdose . If you or someone you are with overdoses, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
