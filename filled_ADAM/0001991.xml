			<Question qid="0001991-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Histocompatibility antigen test</Question>
			<Answer>A histocompatibility antigen blood test looks at proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). These are found on the surface of almost all cells in the human body. HLAs are found in large amounts on the surface of white blood cells. They help the immune system tell the difference between body tissue and substances that are not from your own body.</Answer>
