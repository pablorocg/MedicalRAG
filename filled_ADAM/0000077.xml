			<Question qid="0000077-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Acute kidney failure ?</Question>
			<Answer>Once the cause is found, the goal of treatment is to help your kidneys work again and prevent fluid and waste from building up in your body while they heal. Usually, you will&#160;have to stay overnight in the hospital for treatment. The amount of liquid you drink will be limited to the amount of urine you can produce. You will be told what you may and may not eat to reduce the buildup of toxins that the kidneys would normally remove. Your diet may need to be high in  carbohydrates  and low in  protein , salt, and potassium. You may need antibiotics to treat or prevent infection. Water pills (diuretics) may be used to help remove fluid from your body. Medicines will be given through a vein to help control your blood potassium level. You may need  dialysis . This is a treatment that does what healthy kidneys normally do -- rid the body of harmful wastes, extra salt, and water. Dialysis can save your life if your potassium levels are dangerously high. Dialysis will also be used if:  
  Your mental status changes
  , 
  You develop pericarditis
  , 
  You retain too much fluid
  , 
  You cannot remove nitrogen waste products from your body
  ,  Dialysis will most often be short term. In some cases, the kidney damage is so great that dialysis is needed permanently.</Answer>
