			<Question qid="0000317-2" qtype="causes">What causes Arthritis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Arthritis involves the breakdown of structures of the joint, particularly cartilage. Normal cartilage protects a joint and allows it to move smoothly. Cartilage also absorbs shock when pressure is placed on the joint, such as when you walk. Without the normal amount of cartilage, the bones under the cartilage become damaged and rub together. This causes swelling (inflammation), and stiffness. Other joint structures affected by arthritis include: The synovium, The bone next to the joint, Ligaments and tendons, The linings of the ligaments and tendons (bursae),  Joint inflammation and damage may result from: An autoimmune disease (the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue), Broken bone, General "wear and tear" on joints, Infection, most often by bacteria or virus, Crystals such as uric acid or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate,  In most cases, the joint inflammation goes away after the cause goes away or is treated. Sometimes, it does not. When this happens, you have long-term (chronic) arthritis. Arthritis may occur in people of any age and sex.  Osteoarthritis , which is due to non-inflammatory processes and increases with age, is the most common type. Other, more common types of inflammatory arthritis include: Ankylosing spondylitis , Crystal arthritis, gout, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease,  Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis  (in children), Bacterial infections,  Psoriatic arthritis ,  Reactive arthritis ,  Rheumatoid arthritis  (in adults),  Scleroderma ,  Systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) , </Answer>
