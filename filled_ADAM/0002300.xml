			<Question qid="0002300-7" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Knee microfracture surgery ?</Question>
			<Answer>Many people do well after this surgery. Recovery time can be slow. Many people can go back to sports or other intense activities in about 9 to 12 months. Athletes in very intense sports may not be able to return to their former level. People under age 40 with a recent injury often have the best results. People who are not overweight also have better results. </Answer>
