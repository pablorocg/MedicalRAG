			<Question qid="0001342-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Ectodermal dysplasia ?</Question>
			<Answer>People with ectodermal dysplasia have a lack of sweat glands. This means they may not sweat or sweat less than normal. In children with the disease, their bodies may have a problem controlling fevers. When the skin cannot sweat, it is hard for the body to control temperature properly. So even a mild illness can cause a very high fever. Adults with the disease can't tolerate a warm environment. Air conditioning and other measures are needed to keep a normal body temperature. Depending on which genes are affected, other symptoms may include: Abnormal nails, Abnormal or missing teeth, or fewer than normal number of teeth, Cleft lip, Decreased skin color (pigment), Large forehead, Low nasal bridge, Thin, sparse hair, Learning disabilities, Poor hearing, Poor vision with decreased tear production, Weakened immune system , </Answer>
