			<Question qid="0002155-3" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Imperforate hymen ?</Question>
			<Answer>A minor surgery can fix an imperforate hymen. The surgeon makes a small cut or incision and removes the extra hymen membrane. Girls who are diagnosed with imperforate hymen as babies most often have surgery when they are older and have just started puberty. The surgery is done in early puberty when breast development and pubic hair growth has begun., Girls who are diagnosed when they are older have the same surgery. The surgery allows retained menstrual blood to leave the body. ,  Girls recover from this surgery in a few days. After surgery, the girl may have to insert dilators into the vagina for 15 minutes each day. A dilator looks like a tampon. This keeps the incision from closing on itself and keeps the vagina open.</Answer>
