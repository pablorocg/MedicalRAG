			<Question qid="0000034-2" qtype="causes">What causes Absence seizure ?</Question>
			<Answer>Seizures result from overactivity in the brain. Absence seizures occur most often in people under age 20, usually in children ages 4 to 12. In some cases, the seizures are triggered by flashing lights or when the person breathes faster and more deeply than usual (hyperventilates). They may also occur with other types of seizures, such as  bilateral tonic-clonic seizures  (grand mal seizures), twitches or jerks ( myoclonus ), or sudden loss of muscle strength (atonic seizures).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000034-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Absence seizure ?</Question>
			<Answer>The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system. An  EEG (electroencephalogram)  will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. Blood and urine tests may also be ordered to check for other health problems that may be causing the seizures. Head  CT  or  MRI  scan may be done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain.</Answer>
