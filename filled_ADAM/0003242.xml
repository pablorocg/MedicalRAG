			<Question qid="0003242-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Prostate brachytherapy - discharge</Question>
			<Answer>You had a procedure called  brachytherapy  to treat prostate cancer. Your treatment lasted 30 minutes or more, depending on the type of treatment you had. Before your treatment started, you were given medicine to block pain. Your doctor placed an ultrasound probe into your rectum. You may have also had a Foley catheter (tube) in your bladder to drain urine. Your doctor used CT scans or ultrasound to view the area to be treated.  Needles or special applicators were then used to place metal pellets into your prostate. The pellets deliver radiation into your prostate. They were inserted through your perineum (the area between the scrotum and the anus). </Answer>
