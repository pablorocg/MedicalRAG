			<Question qid="0001143-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Denture problems</Question>
			<Answer>Ill-fitting dentures can move. This may cause sore spots. Denture adhesive may help cut down on this movement. Dental implants may be recommended in most cases. Implants help stabilize the denture, minimize their movement and prevent sores. They should only be placed by a well-trained dentist skilled in dental implant placement. See a dentist if your dentures do not fit correctly. They may need to be adjusted or relined. Other denture tips: Scrub your dentures with plain soap and lukewarm water after eating. Do not clean them with toothpaste., Take out your dentures overnight to prevent sores, infections, and inflammation., Keep your dentures in a denture cleaner overnight., Clean, rest, and massage your gums regularly. Rinse daily with lukewarm salt water to help clean your gums., Do not use toothpicks when wearing dentures., </Answer>
