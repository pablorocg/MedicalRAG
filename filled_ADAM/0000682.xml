			<Question qid="0000682-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Cardiac ablation procedures</Question>
			<Answer>Cardiac ablation is a procedure that is used to scar small areas in your heart that may be involved in your  heart rhythm problems . This can prevent the abnormal electrical signals or rhythms from moving through your heart.  During the procedure, small wires called electrodes are placed inside your heart to measure your heart's electrical activity. When the source of the problem is found, the tissue causing the problem is destroyed.</Answer>
