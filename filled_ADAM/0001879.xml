			<Answer>Heart  magnetic resonance imaging  is an imaging method that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the heart. It does not use radiation (x-rays). Single magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces dozens or sometimes hundreds of images. The test may be done as part of a  chest MRI .</Answer>
