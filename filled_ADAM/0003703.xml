			<Question qid="0003703-2" qtype="causes">What causes Stable angina ?</Question>
			<Answer>Your heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen. The coronary arteries carry oxygen-rich blood to the heart. When the heart muscle has to work harder, it needs more oxygen. Symptoms of angina may occur when blood supply to heart muscle is reduced. This happens when the coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked by  atherosclerosis  or by a blood clot.  The most common cause of angina is  coronary artery disease . Angina pectoris is the medical term for this type of chest pain. Stable angina is less serious than unstable angina, but it can be very painful or uncomfortable. There are many risk factors for  coronary artery disease . Some include: Diabetes ,  High blood pressure , High LDL cholesterol, Low HDL cholesterol, Sedentary lifestyle, Smoking, Advancing age, Male sex,  Anything that makes the heart muscle need more oxygen or reduces the amount of oxygen it receives can cause an angina attack in someone with heart disease, including: Cold weather, Exercise, Emotional stress, Large meals ,  Other causes of angina include: Abnormal heart rhythms  (your heart beats very quickly or your heart rhythm is not regular),  Anemia ,  Coronary artery spasm  (also called Prinzmetal angina),  Heart failure , Heart valve disease,  Hyperthyroidism  (overactive thyroid) , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003703-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Stable angina ?</Question>
			<Answer>Symptoms of stable angina are most often predictable. This means that the same amount of exercise or activity may cause your angina to occur. Your angina should improve or go away when you stop or slow down the exercise. The most common symptom is chest pain that occurs behind the breastbone or slightly to the left of it. The pain of stable angina most often begins slowly and gets worse over the next few minutes before going away. Typically, the chest pain feels like tightness, heavy pressure, squeezing, or a crushing feeling. It may spread to the: Arm (most often the left), Back, Jaw, Neck, Shoulder,  Some people say the pain feels like gas or  indigestion . Less common symptoms of angina may include: Fatigue, Shortness of breath, Weakness, Dizziness or lightheadedness, Nausea, vomiting, and sweating,  Palpitations ,  Pain from stable angina: Most often comes on with activity or stress, Lasts an average of 1 to 15 minutes, Is relieved with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin,  Angina attacks can occur at any time during the day. Often, they occur between 6 a.m. and noon.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003703-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Stable angina ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment for angina may include: Lifestyle changes, Medicines, Procedures such as coronary angiography with stent placement, Coronary artery bypass surgery ,  If you have angina, you and your provider will  develop a daily treatment plan . This plan should include: Medicines you regularly take to prevent angina, Activities that you can do and those you should avoid, Medicines you should take when you have angina pain, Signs that mean  your angina is getting worse , When you should call the doctor or get emergency medical help ,  MEDICINES  You may need to take one or more medicines to treat blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol levels. Follow your provider's directions closely to help prevent your angina from getting worse. Nitroglycerin pills or spray may be used to stop chest pain. Anti-clotting drugs such as aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix), ticagrelor (Brilinta) or prasugrel (Effient) can help prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries and reduce the risk of heart attack. Ask your provider if you should be taking these medicines. You may need to take more medicines to help prevent you from having angina. These include: ACE inhibitors  to lower blood pressure and protect your heart, Beta-blockers to lower heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen use by the heart, Calcium channel blockers to relax arteries, lower blood pressure, and reduce strain on the heart, Nitrates to help prevent angina, Ranolazine (Ranexa) to treat chronic angina ,  NEVER STOP TAKING ANY OF THESE DRUGS ON YOUR OWN.  Always talk to your provider first. Stopping these drugs suddenly can make your angina worse or cause a heart attack. This is especially true for anti-clotting drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel, ticagrelor and prasugrel). Your provider may recommend a cardiac rehabilitation program to help improve your heart's fitness. SURGICAL TREATMENT  Some people will be able to control angina with medicines and not need surgery. Others will need a procedure called  angioplasty and stent placement  (also called percutaneous coronary intervention) to open blocked or narrowed arteries that supply blood to the heart. Blockages that cannot be treated with angioplasty may need  heart bypass surgery  to redirect blood flow around the narrowed or blocked blood vessels.</Answer>
