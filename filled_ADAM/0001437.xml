			<Question qid="0001437-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Erection problems</Question>
			<Answer>An erection problem occurs when a man cannot get or keep an erection that is firm enough for intercourse. You may not be able to get an erection at all. Or, you may lose the erection during intercourse before you are ready. Erection problems do not usually affect your sex drive. Erection problems are common. Almost all adult men have trouble getting or keeping an erection at one time or another. Often the problem goes away with little or no treatment. But for some men, it can be an ongoing problem. This is called erectile dysfunction (ED). If you have trouble getting or keeping an erection more than 25% of the time, you should see your health care provider.</Answer>
