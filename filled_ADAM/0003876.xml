			<Question qid="0003876-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Tennis elbow surgery ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tennis elbow  is caused by doing the same repetitive and forceful arm movements many times. It creates small, painful tears in the tendons in your elbow.  This injury can be caused by tennis, other racquet sports, and activities such as turning a wrench, prolonged typing, or chopping with a knife. The outside (lateral) elbow tendons are most commonly injured. The inside (medial) and backside (posterior) tendons can also be affected, but usually with different activities. The condition can be worsened if the tendons are further injured by trauma to the tendons. This article discusses surgery to repair tennis elbow.</Answer>
