			<Question qid="0002780-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Neurofibromatosis 2 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a disorder in which tumors form on the nerves of the brain and spine (the central nervous system). It may be passed down (inherited) in families. Although it has a similar name to  neurofibromatosis type 1 , it is a different and separate condition.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002780-2" qtype="causes">What causes Neurofibromatosis 2 ?</Question>
			<Answer>NF2 is caused by a mutation in the gene NF2. NF2 can be passed down through families in an  autosomal dominant  pattern. This means that if one parent has NF2, any child of that parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. Once someone carries the genetic change, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it. Some cases of NF2 occur when the gene mutates on its own. This is called sporadic and is not inherited.</Answer>
