			<Question qid="0002131-2" qtype="causes">What causes IgA nephropathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>IgA is a protein, called an  antibody , that helps the body fight infections. IgA nephropathy occurs when too much of this protein is deposited in the kidneys. IgA builds up inside the small blood vessels of the kidney. Structures in the kidney called glomeruli become inflamed and damaged. The disorder can appear suddenly ( acute ), or get worse slowly over many years (chronic  glomerulonephritis ). Risk factors include: A personal or family history of IgA nephropathy or Henoch-Sch&#246;nlein  purpura , a form of  vasculitis  that affects many parts of the body, White or Asian ethnicity,  IgA nephropathy can occur in people of all ages, but it most often affects males in their teens to late 30s.</Answer>
