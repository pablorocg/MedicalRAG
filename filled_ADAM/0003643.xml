			<Question qid="0003643-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Smoking and COPD ?</Question>
			<Answer>Things that make COPD symptoms worse are called triggers. Knowing what your triggers are and how to avoid them can help you feel better. Smoking is a trigger for many people who have COPD. Smoking can cause an exacerbation, or flare-up, of your symptoms. You do not have to be a smoker for smoking to cause harm. Exposure to someone else's smoking (called secondhand smoke) is also a trigger for COPD flare-ups. Smoking damages your lungs. When you have COPD and you smoke, your lungs will get damaged more rapidly than if you were to stop smoking.</Answer>
