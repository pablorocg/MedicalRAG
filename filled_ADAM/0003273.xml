			<Question qid="0003273-2" qtype="causes">What causes Pseudotumor cerebri ?</Question>

			<Question qid="0003273-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Pseudotumor cerebri ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment is aimed at the cause of IIH. The main goal of treatments is to preserve vision and reduce the severity of headaches. A  lumbar puncture &#160;(spinal tap) can help relieve pressure in the brain and prevent vision problems.&#160;Repeat lumbar punctures are helpful for pregnant women in order to delay surgery until after delivery. Other treatments may include: Fluid or salt restriction, Medicines such as corticosteroids, acetazolamide, furosemide, and topiramate, Shunting procedures to relieve pressure from spinal fluid buildup, Surgery to relieve pressure on the optic nerve, Weight loss , Treatment of the underlying disease, such as vitamin A overdose,  People will need to have their vision closely monitored. There can be vision loss, which is sometimes permanent. Follow-up MRI or CT scans may be done to rule out problems such as tumors or hydrocephalus (buildup of fluid inside the skull). In some cases, the pressure inside the brain remains high for many years. Symptoms can return in some people. A small number of people have symptoms that slowly get worse and lead to blindness.</Answer>
