			<Question qid="0001846-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Healthy grocery shopping ?</Question>
			<Answer>A key step for losing weight, keeping the weight off, and staying healthy is learning how to buy the right foods at the store. This will ensure you have healthy choices at home. Avoid regularly bringing chips or cookies into the home. Instead, having to go out to buy an unhealthy treat gives you more time to make a conscious decision about eating that food. It is fine to include these foods in your diet, but you don't want to eat them mindlessly.</Answer>
