			<Question qid="0003116-2" qtype="causes">What causes Pleural effusion ?</Question>
			<Answer>The body produces pleural fluid in small amounts to lubricate the surfaces of the pleura. This is the thin tissue that lines the chest cavity and surrounds the lungs. Pleural effusion is an abnormal, excessive collection of this fluid. There are two types of pleural effusion: Transudative pleural effusion is caused by fluid leaking into the pleural space. This is from increased pressure in the blood vessels or a low blood protein count.  Heart failure  is the most common cause., Exudative effusion is caused by blocked blood vessels or lymph vessels, inflammation, infection, lung injury, or tumors. ,  Risk factors for pleural effusion may include: Smoking and drinking alcohol, as these can cause heart, lung and liver disease, which can lead to pleural effusion, History of any contact with asbestos , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003116-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Pleural effusion ?</Question>
			<Answer>Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. The provider will also listen to your lungs with a stethoscope and tap (percuss) your chest and upper back. Chest CT scan  or a  chest x-ray  may be enough for your provider to decide on treatment. Your provider may want to perform tests on the fluid. If so, a sample of  fluid is removed with a needle  inserted between the ribs. Tests on the fluid will be done to look for: Infection, Cancer cells, Protein levels , Cell counts, Acidity of the fluid (sometimes),  Blood tests that may be done include: Complete blood count (CBC), to check for signs of infection or anemia, Kidney and liver function blood tests ,  If needed, these other tests may be done: Ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) to look for heart failure, Ultrasound of abdomen and liver, Urine protein testing, Lung biopsy to look for cancer, Passing a tube through the windpipe to check the airways for problems or cancer ( bronchoscopy ) , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003116-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Pleural effusion ?</Question>
			<Answer>The goal of treatment is to: Remove the fluid, Prevent fluid from building up again, Determine and treat the cause of the fluid buildup ,  Removing the fluid  (thoracentesis) may be done if there is a lot of fluid and it is causing chest pressure, shortness of breath, or a low oxygen level. Removing the fluid allows the lung to expand, making breathing easier. The cause of the fluid buildup must also be treated: If it is due to heart failure, you may receive diuretics (water pills) and other medicines to treat heart failure., If it is due to an infection, antibiotics will be given. Sometimes additional treatment is needed., If it is from cancer, liver disease, or kidney disease, treatment should be directed at these conditions. ,  In people with cancer or infection, the effusion is often treated by using a chest tube to drain the fluid and treating its cause. In some cases, any of the following treatments are done: Chemotherapy , Placing medicine into the chest that prevents fluid from building up again after it is drained, Leaving a small size tube in place for a longer period to let the fluid drain and the lung expand overtime,  Radiation therapy , Surgery , </Answer>
