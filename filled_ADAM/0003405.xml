			<Question qid="0003405-9" qtype="prevention">How to prevent Reye syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Never give a child aspirin unless told to do so by your child's provider. When a child must take aspirin for a medical condition, take care to reduce the child's risk of catching a viral illness, such as the flu and chickenpox. Avoid aspirin for several weeks after the child has received a varicella (chickenpox) vaccine. Note : Other over-the-counter medicines, such as Pepto-Bismol and substances with oil of wintergreen also contain aspirin compounds called salicylates. DO NOT give these to a child who has a cold or fever.</Answer>
