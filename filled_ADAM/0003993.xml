			<Question qid="0003993-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Tracheal rupture ?</Question>
			<Answer>People who have had a trauma will need to have their injuries treated. Injuries to the trachea often need to be repaired during surgery. Injuries to the smaller bronchi can sometimes be treated without surgery. A  collapsed lung  is treated with a chest tube connected to suction, which re-expands the lung. For people who have breathed a foreign body into the airways, bronchoscopy may be used to take out the object. Antibiotics are used in people with an infection in the part of the lung around the injury.</Answer>

The outlook is always better if the person does not have many chronic medical conditions. The outlook is good for people whose tracheal or bronchial disruption is due to causes such as a foreign object, which tend to have a good outcome. In the months or years after the injury, scarring at the injury site may cause problems, such as narrowing, which require other tests or procedures.</Answer>
