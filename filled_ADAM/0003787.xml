			<Question qid="0003787-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Supporting your child with weight loss ?</Question>
			<Answer>The first step in helping your child have a healthy weight is to talk with their health care provider. Your child's provider can set healthy goals for weight-loss and help with monitoring and support. Getting support from friends and family will also help your child lose weight. Try to get the whole family to join a weight-loss plan, even if weight loss is not the goal for everyone. Weight-loss plans for children focus on healthy lifestyle habits. All family members can benefit from having healthier lifestyles.</Answer>
