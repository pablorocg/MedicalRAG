			<Question qid="0000472-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Bleeding disorders ?</Question>

These disorders can lead to heavy and prolonged bleeding after an injury or surgery. Bleeding can also begin on its own and may be difficult to stop. Specific bleeding disorders include: Acquired platelet function defects ,  Congenital platelet function defects ,  Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) ,  Prothrombin deficiency ,  Factor V deficiency ,  Factor VII deficiency ,  Factor X deficiency , Factor XI deficiency (hemophilia C),  Glanzmann disease ,  Hemophilia A ,  Hemophilia B ,  Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) ,  Von Willebrand disease  (types I, II, and III) , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000472-2" qtype="causes">What causes Bleeding disorders ?</Question>
			<Answer>Watch this video about: Blood clotting Normal blood clotting involves blood particles, called platelets, and as many as 20 different plasma proteins that layer over the platelets. These proteins are known as blood clotting or coagulation factors. These factors interact with other chemicals to form a substance called fibrin that stops bleeding. Problems can occur when platelets are low in number or do not work properly or when certain coagulation factors are low or missing. Bleeding problems can range from mild to severe. Some bleeding disorders are present at birth and are passed down through families (inherited). Others develop from: Illnesses, such as vitamin K deficiency or severe liver disease, Treatments, such as the use of drugs to stop blood clots (anticoagulants) or the long-term use of antibiotics ,  Bleeding disorders can also result from a problem with the number or function of platelets. These disorders can also be either inherited or develop later (acquired). The side effects of certain drugs often lead to the acquired forms.</Answer>
