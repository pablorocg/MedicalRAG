Fenoprofen calcium overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose. This article is for information only.

If you or someone you are with has an  overdose , call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
