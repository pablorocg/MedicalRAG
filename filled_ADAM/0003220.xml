			<Question qid="0003220-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Preventing stroke ?</Question>
			<Answer>A stroke occurs when the blood flow is cut off to any part of the brain. The loss of blood flow can be caused by a blood clot in an artery of the brain. It can also be caused by a blood vessel in a part of the brain that becomes weak and bursts open. A stroke is sometimes called a "brain attack."</Answer>
