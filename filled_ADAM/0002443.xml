			<Question qid="0002443-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Low white blood cell count and cancer ?</Question>
			<Answer>White blood cells (WBCs) fight infections from bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other germs. One important type of WBC is the neutrophil. These cells are made in the bone marrow and travel in the blood throughout the body. They sense infections, gather at sites of infection, and destroy the germs.  When the body has too few neutrophils, the condition is called neutropenia. This makes it harder for the body to fight off infection, and a person is more likely to get sick. In general, an adult who has fewer than 1,000 neutrophils in a microliter of blood has neutropenia. If the neutrophil count is very low, fewer than 500 neutrophils in a microliter of blood, it is called severe neutropenia. When the neutrophil count gets this low, even the bacteria normally living in a person's mouth, skin, and gut can cause serious infections.</Answer>
