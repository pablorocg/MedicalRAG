			<Question qid="0003741-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Strep throat ?</Question>
			<Answer>Many other causes of sore throat may have the same symptoms. Your health care provider must do a test to diagnose strep throat and decide whether to prescribe antibiotics. A rapid  strep test  can be done in most provider offices. However, the test may be negative, even if strep is present.  If the rapid strep test is negative and your provider still suspects that the strep bacteria is causing the sore throat, a throat swab can be tested (cultured) to see if strep grows from it. Results will take 1 to 2 days.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003741-9" qtype="prevention">How to prevent Strep throat ?</Question>
			<Answer>Most people with strep can spread the infection to others until they have been on antibiotics for 24 to 48 hours. They should stay home from school, daycare, or work until they have been on antibiotics for at least a day. Get a new toothbrush after 2 or 3 days, but before finishing the antibiotics. Otherwise, the bacteria can live on the toothbrush and reinfect you when the antibiotics are done. Also, keep your family's toothbrushes and utensils separate, unless they have been washed. If repeated cases of strep still occur in a family, check to see if someone is a strep carrier. Carriers have strep in their throats, but the bacteria do not make them sick. Sometimes, treating them can prevent others from getting strep throat.</Answer>
