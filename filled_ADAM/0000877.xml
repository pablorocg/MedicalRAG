			<Question qid="0000877-7" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Clubfoot repair ?</Question>
			<Answer>After recovering from surgery, your child's foot will be in a much better position. Your child should be able to have a normal, active life, including playing sports. But the foot may be stiffer than a foot that has not been treated with surgery. In most cases of clubfoot, if only one side is affected, the child's foot and calf will be smaller than normal for the rest of the child's life. Children who have had clubfoot surgery may need another surgery later in life.</Answer>
