			<Question qid="0003184-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Preeclampsia - self-care ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pregnant women with preeclampsia have high blood pressure and signs of liver or kidney damage. Kidney damage results in the presence of protein in the urine. Preeclampsia that occurs in women after the 20th week of pregnancy can be mild or severe. Preeclampsia usually resolves after the baby is born and the placenta is delivered. However, it may persist or even begin after delivery, most often within 48 hours. This is called postpartum preeclampsia.</Answer>
