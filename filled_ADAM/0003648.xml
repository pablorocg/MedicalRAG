			<Question qid="0003648-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Snacks for adults</Question>
			<Answer>For almost anyone trying to watch their weight, choosing healthy snacks can be a challenge. Even though snacking has developed a "bad image," snacks can be an important part of your diet. They can provide energy in the middle of the day or when you exercise. A healthy snack between meals can also decrease your hunger and keep you from overeating at meal time. There are many snacks to choose from, and certainly not all snacks are healthy or will help you manage your weight. Try to limit the unhealthy snacks you bring into the house. If they are not available, you are more likely to make healthy choices.</Answer>
