			<Answer>A sprain is an injury to the ligaments around a joint. Ligaments are strong, flexible fibers that hold bones together. When you sprain your wrist, you have strained or torn one or more of the ligaments in your wrist joint. This can happen from landing on your hand wrong when you fall. See a health care provider as soon as possible after your injury.</Answer>
