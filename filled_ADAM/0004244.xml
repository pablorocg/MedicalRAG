			<Question qid="0004244-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Vitamin B6</Question>
			<Answer>Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water so the body cannot store them. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. Although the body maintains a small pool of water-soluble vitamins, they have to be taken regularly. Lack of vitamin B6 in the body is uncommon. It can occur in people with kidney failure, liver disease, or alcohol dependence.</Answer>
