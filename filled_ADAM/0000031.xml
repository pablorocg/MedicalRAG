			<Question qid="0000031-2" qtype="causes">What causes Abscess ?</Question>
			<Answer>Abscesses occur when an area of tissue becomes infected and the body's immune system tries to fight and contain it. White blood cells (WBCs) move through the walls of the blood vessels into the area of the infection and collect in the damaged tissue. During this process, pus forms. Pus is the buildup of fluid, living and dead white blood cells, dead tissue, and bacteria or other foreign substances. Abscesses can form in almost any part of the body. The skin, under the skin, and the teeth are the most common sites. Abscesses may be caused by bacteria, parasites, and foreign substances. Abscesses in the skin are easy to see. They are red, raised, and painful. Abscesses in other areas of the body may not be seen, but they may cause organ damage. Some types and locations of abscesses include: Abdominal abscess ,  Amebic liver abscess ,  Anorectal abscess ,  Bartholin gland abscess ,  Brain abscess ,  Epidural abscess ,  Peritonsillar abscess ,  Pyogenic liver abscess ,  Spinal cord abscess ,  Subcutaneous (skin) abscess ,  Tooth abscess , </Answer>
