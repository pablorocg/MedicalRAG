			<Question qid="0001695-7" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Gastroschisis repair ?</Question>
			<Answer>After you go home, your child may develop a blockage in the intestines ( bowel obstruction ) due to a kink or scar in the intestines. The health care provider can tell you how this will be treated. Most of the time, gastroschisis can be corrected with one or two surgeries. How well your baby does will depend on how much damage there was to the intestine. After recovering from surgery, most children with gastroschisis do very well and live normal lives. Most babies who are born with gastroschisis do not have any other birth defects.</Answer>
