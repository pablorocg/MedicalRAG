			<Question qid="0003164-2" qtype="causes">What causes Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (GN) ?</Question>
			<Answer>Poststreptococcal GN is a form of  glomerulonephritis . It is caused by an infection with a type of streptococcus bacteria. The infection does not occur in the kidneys, but in a different part of the body, such as the skin or throat. The disorder may develop 1 to 2 weeks after an untreated throat infection, or 3 to 4 weeks after a skin infection. It may occur in people of any age, but it most often occurs in children ages 6 through 10. Although skin and throat infections are common in children, poststreptococcal GN is rarely a complication of these infections. Poststreptococcal GN causes the tiny blood vessels in the filtering units of the kidneys (glomeruli) to become inflamed. This makes the kidneys less able to filter the blood to create urine. The condition is not common today because infections that can lead to the disorder are treated with antibiotics. Risk factors include: Strep throat , Streptococcal skin infections (such as  impetigo ), </Answer>

			<Answer>A physical examination shows swelling (edema), especially in the face. Abnormal sounds may be heard when listening to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Blood pressure is often high. Other tests that may be done include: Anti-DNase B ,  Serum ASO  (and streptolysin O),  Serum complement levels ,  Urinalysis ,  Kidney biopsy  (usually not needed) , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003164-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (GN) ?</Question>
			<Answer>There is no specific treatment for this disorder. Treatment is focused on relieving symptoms. Antibiotics, such as penicillin, will likely be used to destroy any streptococcal bacteria that remain in the body., Blood pressure medicines and diuretic drugs may be needed to control swelling and high blood pressure., Corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory medicines are generally not effective.,  You may need to limit salt in your diet to control swelling and high blood pressure.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003164-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (GN) ?</Question>
			<Answer>Poststreptococcal GN usually goes away by itself after several weeks to months. In small number of adults, it may get worse and lead to long-term (chronic) kidney failure. Sometimes, it can progress to  end-stage kidney disease , which requires  dialysis  and a  kidney transplant .</Answer>
