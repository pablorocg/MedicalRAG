			<Question qid="0003627-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Sleepwalking and children</Question>
			<Answer>Question: Is sleepwalking normal for children? Answer: Sleepwalking  is a disturbance in which someone gets up out of bed and walks without being aware of the event. It is most often triggered by poor sleep habits. In children, sleepwalking starts between ages 6 and 12. It occurs more often in boys than girls. Children outgrow sleepwalking in most cases. If you can, gently steer someone who is sleepwalking safely back to bed. Try to make the home safer by adding gates to stairways and other safety measures to prevent injury. Trying to stick to a bedtime routine may help reduce the problem.</Answer>
