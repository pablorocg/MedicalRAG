			<Question qid="0001849-3" qtype="causes">What causes Hearing loss ?</Question>
			<Answer>Conductive hearing loss (CHL) occurs because of a mechanical problem in the outer or middle ear. This may be because: Sound is not reaching the eardrum., The eardrum is not vibrating in response to sound., The 3 tiny bones of the ear (ossicles) are not conducting sound properly.,  Causes of conductive hearing loss can often be treated. They include: Buildup of wax in the ear canal, Damage to the very small bones (ossicles) that are right behind the eardrum,  Fluid remaining in the ear  after an  ear infection , Foreign object that is stuck in the ear canal, Hole in the eardrum, Scar on the eardrum from repeated infections ,  Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurs when the tiny hair cells (nerve endings) that detect sound in the inner ear are injured, diseased, do not work correctly, or have died. This type of hearing loss often cannot be reversed. Sensorineural hearing loss is commonly caused by: Acoustic neuroma,  Age-related hearing loss , Childhood infections, such as  meningitis ,  mumps ,  scarlet fever , and  measles , M&#233;ni&#232;re disease, Regular exposure to loud noises (such as from work or recreation), Use of certain medicines ,  Hearing loss may be present at birth (congenital) and can be due to: Birth defects that cause changes in the ear structures, Genetic conditions (more than 400 are known), Infections the mother passes to her baby in the womb, such as  toxoplasmosis ,  rubella , or  herpes ,  The ear can also be injured by: Pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum , often from scuba diving, Skull fractures (can damage the structures or nerves of the ear), Trauma  from explosions, fireworks, gunfire, rock concerts, and earphones , </Answer>
