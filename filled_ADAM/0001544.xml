			<Question qid="0001544-2" qtype="causes">What causes Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency ?</Question>
			<Answer>Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is caused by a defective gene that is passed down through families. People with this condition lack an  enzyme  called lipoprotein lipase. Without this enzyme, the body cannot break down fat from digested food. Fat particles called chylomicrons build up in the blood. Risk factors include a family history of lipoprotein lipase deficiency. The condition usually first develops during infancy or childhood.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001544-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment aims to control the symptoms and blood triglyceride levels with a very low-fat diet. Your provider will likely recommend that you eat no more than 20 grams of fat per day to prevent the symptoms from coming back. Twenty grams of fat is equal to one of the following: Two 8-ounce (240 milliliters) glasses of whole milk, 4 teaspoons (9.5 grams) of margarine, 4 ounces (113 grams) serving of meat,  The average American diet has a fat content of up to 45% of total calories. Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K and mineral supplements are recommended for people who eat a very low-fat diet. You may want to discuss your diet needs with your&#160;provider and a registered dietitian. Pancreatitis that is related to lipoprotein lipase deficiency responds to treatments for that disorder.</Answer>
