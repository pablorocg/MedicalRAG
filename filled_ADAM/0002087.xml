			<Question qid="0002087-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Hypersplenism ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hypersplenism is an overactive spleen. The spleen is an organ found in the upper left side of your abdomen. The spleen helps filter old and damaged cells from your bloodstream. If your spleen is overactive, it removes the blood cells too early and too quickly. An overactive spleen is often, but not always, enlarged (splenomegaly). The spleen plays a key role in helping your body fight infections. Problems with the spleen can make you more likely to develop infections.</Answer>
