			<Question qid="0001245-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Dislocated shoulder - aftercare</Question>
			<Answer>The shoulder is a ball and socket joint. This means the round top of your arm bone (the ball) fits into the groove in your shoulder blade (the socket). When you have a dislocated shoulder, it means the entire ball is out of the socket. When you have a partly dislocated shoulder, it means only part of the ball is out of the socket. This is called a shoulder subluxation.</Answer>
