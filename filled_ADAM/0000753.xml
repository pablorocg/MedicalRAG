			<Question qid="0000753-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Cervix</Question>
			<Answer>The cervix is the lower end of the womb (uterus). It is at the top of the  vagina . It is about 2.5 to 3.5 centimeters (1 to 1.3 inches) long. The cervical canal passes through the cervix. It allows blood from a menstrual period and a baby (fetus) to pass from the womb into the vagina. The sperm travel from the vagina up the cervical canal into the uterine cavity, then into the fallopian tubes to fertilize the egg. Conditions that affect the cervix include: Cervical cancer , Cervical infection,  Cervical inflammation ,  Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)  or  dysplasia ,  Cervical polyps ,  Cervical pregnancy , Cervical incompetence in pregnancy ,  A  Pap smear  is a screening test to check for premalignant (precancerous) changes that can lead to cancer of the cervix. When HPV (human papillomavirus) screening is done, the test specimen is also collected from the cervix.</Answer>
