			<Question qid="0000973-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Cooking without salt</Question>
			<Answer>Sodium  is one of the main elements in table salt (NaCl or sodium chloride). It is added to many foods to enhance the flavor. Too much sodium is linked to high blood pressure. Eating a  low-salt diet  is an important way to take care of your heart. Most people eat about 3,400 mg of sodium a day. This is about twice as much as the American Heart Association recommends. Most healthy people should have no more than 2,300 mg of sodium a day. People over 50 years old, and those who have high blood pressure, may need to limit sodium to 1,500 mg a day or less. To get down to a healthy level, learn how to trim the excess salt from your diet.</Answer>
