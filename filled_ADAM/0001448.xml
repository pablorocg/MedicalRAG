			<Answer>Eschar is dead tissue that forms over healthy skin and then, over time, falls off (sheds). It is caused by a  burn  or  cauterization  (destroying tissue with heat or cold, or another method). An escharotic is a substance (such as acids, alkalis, carbon dioxide, or metallic salts) that causes the tissue to die and fall off.</Answer>
