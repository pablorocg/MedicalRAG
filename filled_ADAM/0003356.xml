			<Question qid="0003356-9" qtype="considerations">What to do for Refraction test ?</Question>
			<Answer>You should have a complete eye examination every 3 to 5 years if you have no problems. If your vision becomes blurry, worsens, or if there are other noticeable changes, schedule an exam right away. After age 40 (or for people with a family history of  glaucoma ), eye exams should be scheduled at least once a year to test for glaucoma. Anyone with diabetes should also have an eye exam at least once a year or as recommended by their provider. People with a refractive error should have an eye exam every 1 to 2 years, or when their vision changes.</Answer>
