			<Question qid="0003408-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Rhabdomyolysis ?</Question>

			<Question qid="0003408-2" qtype="causes">What causes Rhabdomyolysis ?</Question>
			<Answer>When muscle is damaged, a protein called myoglobin is released into the bloodstream. It is then filtered out of the body by the kidneys. Myoglobin breaks down into substances that can damage kidney cells. Rhabdomyolysis may be caused by injury or any other condition that damages skeletal muscle. Problems that may lead to this disease include: Trauma or crush injuries, Use of drugs or medicines such as  cocaine , amphetamines, statins,  heroin , or PCP, Genetic muscle diseases, Extremes of body temperature, Ischemia or death of muscle tissue, Low phosphate levels,  Seizures  or muscle tremors, Severe exertion, such as marathon running or calisthenics, Lengthy surgical procedures, Severe dehydration , </Answer>

			<Answer>A physical exam will show tender or damaged skeletal muscles. The following tests may be done: Creatine kinase  (CK) level, Serum calcium,  Serum myoglobin ,  Serum potassium ,  Urinalysis ,  Urine myoglobin  test ,  This disease may also affect the results of the following tests: CK isoenzymes ,  Serum creatinine ,  Urine creatinine , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003408-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Rhabdomyolysis ?</Question>
			<Answer>You will need to get fluids containing bicarbonate to help prevent kidney damage. You may need to get fluids through a vein (IV). Some people may need kidney dialysis. Your health care provider may prescribe medicines including diuretics and bicarbonate (if there is enough urine output). Hyperkalemia  and low blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia) should be treated right away.  Kidney failure  should also be treated.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003408-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Rhabdomyolysis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The outcome depends on the amount of  kidney damage . Acute kidney failure occurs in many people. Getting treated soon after rhabdomyolysis will reduce the risk of permanent kidney damage. People with milder cases may return to their normal activities within a few weeks to a month. However, some people continue to have problems with fatigue and muscle pain.</Answer>
