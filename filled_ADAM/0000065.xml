			<Question qid="0000065-2" qtype="causes">What causes Acromegaly ?</Question>
			<Answer>Acromegaly is a rare condition. It is caused when the pituitary gland makes too much GH. The pituitary gland is a small  endocrine gland  attached to the bottom of the brain. It controls, makes, and releases several hormones, including GH. Usually, a noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland releases too much GH. In rare cases, pituitary tumors can be inherited. In children, too much GH causes  gigantism  rather than acromegaly.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000065-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Acromegaly ?</Question>
			<Answer>Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. The following tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis of acromegaly and check for complications: Blood glucose ,  Growth hormone , Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1),  Prolactin ,  Spine x-ray ,  MRI of the brain , including the pituitary gland,  Echocardiogram ,  Colonoscopy , Sleep study,  Other tests may be ordered to check whether the rest of the pituitary gland is working normally. Often a  GH suppression test  is needed. This involves drawing blood from a vein 4 or 5 times over 2 hours before and after drinking a specific amount of a sugar solution. Glucose and GH are measured in the blood.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000065-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Acromegaly ?</Question>
			<Answer>Surgery to remove the pituitary tumor that is causing this condition often corrects the abnormal GH. Sometimes, the tumor is too large to be removed completely and acromegaly is not cured. In this case, medicines and  radiation  (radiotherapy) may be used to treat acromegaly. Some people with tumors that are too complicated to remove by surgery are treated with medicines instead of surgery. These medicines may block the production of GH from the pituitary gland or prevent the action of GH in other parts of the body. After treatment, you will need to see your provider regularly to make sure that the pituitary gland is working normally and that acromegaly does not come back. Yearly evaluations are usually recommended.</Answer>
