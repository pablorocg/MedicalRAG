			<Answer>Using a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) seems simple. But many people do not use them the right way. If you use your MDI the wrong way, less medicine gets to your lungs, and most remains in the back of your mouth. If you have a spacer, use it. It helps get more medicine into your airways. ( The instructions below are not for dry powder inhalers. They have different instructions .)</Answer>
