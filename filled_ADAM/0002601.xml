			<Question qid="0002601-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Mesenteric artery ischemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Mesenteric artery ischemia occurs when there is a narrowing or blockage of one or more of the three major arteries that supply the small and large intestines. These are called the mesenteric arteries. </Answer>
	</QAPair>

			<Question qid="0002601-2" qtype="causes">What causes Mesenteric artery ischemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>The arteries that supply blood to the intestines run directly from the aorta. The aorta is the main artery from the heart. Hardening of the arteries  occurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries. This is more common in smokers and in people with high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol. This narrows the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the intestines. Like every other part of the body, blood brings oxygen to the intestines. When the oxygen supply is slowed, symptoms may occur. The blood supply to the intestines may be suddenly blocked by a blood clot ( embolus ). The clots most often come from the heart or aorta. These clots are more commonly seen in people with abnormal heart rhythm.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002601-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Mesenteric artery ischemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Symptoms caused by gradual hardening of the mesenteric arteries include: Abdominal pain after eating, Diarrhea ,  Symptoms of sudden (acute) mesenteric artery ischemia due to a traveling blood clot include: Sudden severe abdominal pain or bloating, Diarrhea, Vomiting, Fever, Nausea, </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002601-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Mesenteric artery ischemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>When symptoms begin suddenly or become severe, blood tests may show increased  white blood cell  count and changes in the blood acid level. There may be bleeding in the GI tract. A Doppler ultrasound or  CT angiogram scan  may show problems with the blood vessels and the intestine. A  mesenteric angiogram  is a test that involves injecting a special dye into your bloodstream to highlight the arteries of the intestine. Then x-rays are taken of the area. This can show the location of the blockage in the artery.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002601-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Mesenteric artery ischemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>When blood supply is blocked to a part of the heart muscle, the muscle will die. This is called a heart attack. A similar type of injury can occur to any part of the intestines. When the blood supply is suddenly cut off by a blood clot, it is an emergency. Treatment can include medicines to dissolve the blood clots and open up the arteries. If you have symptoms due to hardening of the mesenteric arteries, there are things you can do to control the problem: Stop smoking. Smoking narrows the arteries. This decreases the ability of the blood to carry oxygen and increases the risk of forming clots (thrombi and emboli)., Make sure your blood pressure is under control., If you are overweight, reduce your weight., If your cholesterol is high, eat a low-cholesterol and low-fat diet., Monitor your blood sugar level if you have diabetes, and keep it under control.,  Surgery may be done if the problem is severe. The blockage is removed and the arteries are reconnected to the aorta. A bypass around the blockage is another procedure. It is usually done with a plastic tube graft., Insertion of a stent. A stent may be used as an alternative to surgery to enlarge the blockage in the artery or to deliver medicine directly to the affected area. This is a new technique and it should only be done by experienced health care providers. The outcome is usually better with surgery., At times, a portion of your intestine will need to be removed., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002601-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Mesenteric artery ischemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>The outlook for chronic mesenteric ischemia is good after a successful surgery. However, it is important to make lifestyle changes to prevent hardening of the arteries from getting worse. People with hardening of the arteries that supply the intestines often have the same problems in blood vessels that supply the heart, brain, kidneys, or legs. People with acute mesenteric ischemia often do poorly because parts of the intestine may die before surgery can be done. This can be fatal. However, with prompt diagnosis and treatment, acute mesenteric ischemia can be treated successfully.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002601-7" qtype="complications">What are the complications of Mesenteric artery ischemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tissue death from lack of blood flow (infarction) in the intestines is the most serious complication of mesenteric artery ischemia. Surgery may be needed to remove the dead portion.</Answer>
