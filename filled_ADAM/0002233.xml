Many normal substances exist in the body as ions. Common examples include sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, and bicarbonate. These substances are known as  electrolytes . Ions can be created using radiation such as x-rays. Ionizing radiation is often used to diagnose or treat a medical condition.</Answer>
