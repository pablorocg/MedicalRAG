			<Question qid="0000233-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Angioplasty and stent placement - peripheral arteries - discharge</Question>
			<Answer>Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to your legs. Fatty deposits can build up inside the arteries and block blood flow. A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that keeps the artery open. Angioplasty and stent placement are two ways to open blocked peripheral arteries.</Answer>
