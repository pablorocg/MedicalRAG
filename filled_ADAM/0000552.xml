			<Answer>Self-care may include applying moist heat to the infected breast tissue for 15 to 20 minutes four times a day. You may also need to take pain relievers. Antibiotics are very effective in treating a breast infection. If you take antibiotics, you must continue to breastfeed or pump to relieve breast swelling from milk production. If there is an abscess that does not go away, needle aspiration under ultrasound guidance is done, along with antibiotics. If this method fails to cure the abscess, then incision and drainage is the treatment of choice.</Answer>
