			<Question qid="0002344-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Lateral traction</Question>
			<Answer>Traction  can be used to treat or reduce any joint  dislocation  or bone fracture by applying tension to the leg or arm with weights and pulleys to realign the bone. For example, it may be used to help line up a broken bone while it heals. Traction can reduce pain related to the injury. Traction can also be used during surgery to allow your surgeon to evaluate your joint better. This is commonly done in arthroscopic surgery of the shoulder. Traction as a treatment involves specifying the amount of tension or force used, the length of time the tension is used, and the means used to maintain the tension.</Answer>
