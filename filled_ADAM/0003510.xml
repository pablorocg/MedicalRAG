			<Question qid="0003510-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Secondary systemic amyloidosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Secondary systemic amyloidosis is a disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in tissues and organs. Clumps of the abnormal proteins are called amyloid deposits. Secondary means it occurs because of another disease or situation. For example, this condition usually occurs due to  long-term  (chronic) infection or inflammation. In contrast, primary amyloidosis means there is no other disease that is causing the condition. Systemic means that the disease affects the entire body.</Answer>
