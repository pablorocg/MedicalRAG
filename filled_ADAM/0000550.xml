			<Question qid="0000550-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Breast cancer staging ?</Question>
			<Answer>The type of cancer you have, along with the stage, will help determine your treatment. With stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the main goal is to cure the cancer by treating it and keeping it from coming back. With stage IV, the goal is to improve symptoms and prolong life. In almost all cases, stage IV breast cancer cannot be cured.</Answer>
