			<Question qid="0002080-2" qtype="causes">What causes Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is also called Job syndrome. It is named after the biblical character Job, whose faithfulness was tested by an affliction with draining skin sores and  pustules . People with this condition have long-term, severe skin infections. The symptoms are most often present in childhood, but because the disease is so rare, it often takes years before a correct diagnosis is made. Recent research suggests that the disease is often caused by a genetic change that takes place in the  STAT3 gene  on  chromosome  17. How this gene abnormality causes the symptoms of the disease is not well understood. However, people with the disease have a higher-than-normal level of a type of  antibody  called IgE.</Answer>
