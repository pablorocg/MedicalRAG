			<Question qid="0002058-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Hydrocele repair</Question>
			<Answer>Hydrocele repair is surgery to correct the swelling of the  scrotum  that occurs when you have a hydrocele. A  hydrocele  is a collection of fluid around a testicle. Baby boys sometimes have a hydrocele at birth. Hydroceles also occur in older boys and men. Sometimes they form when there is also a hernia (an abnormal bulging of tissue) present. Hydroceles are fairly common.</Answer>
