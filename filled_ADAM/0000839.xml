			<Question qid="0000839-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a disorder that involves nerve swelling and irritation (inflammation) that leads to a loss of strength or sensation.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000839-2" qtype="causes">What causes Chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>CIDP is one cause of damage to nerves outside the brain or spinal cord ( peripheral neuropathy ). Polyneuropathy means several nerves are involved. CIDP often affects both sides of the body. CIDP is caused by an abnormal  immune response . CIDP occurs when the immune system attacks the  myelin cover  of the nerves. For this reason, CIDP is thought to be an  autoimmune disease . Health care providers also consider CIDP as the  chronic  form of Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome. The specific triggers of CIDP vary. In many cases, the cause cannot be identified. CIDP may occur with other conditions, such as: Chronic  hepatitis , Diabetes, Infection with the bacterium  Campylobacter jejuni , HIV/AIDS, Immune system disorders due to cancer,  Inflammatory bowel disease ,  Systemic lupus erythematosus , Cancer of the lymph system, Overactive thyroid, Side effects of medicines to treat cancer or HIV, </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000839-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>The provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms, focusing on the nervous system and muscles. Tests that may be ordered include: Electromyography ( EMG ) to check the muscles and the nerves that control the muscles,  Nerve conduction tests  to check how fast electrical signals move through a nerve,  Nerve biopsy  to remove a small piece of a nerve for examination,  Spinal tap  (lumbar puncture) to check the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, Blood tests may be done to look for specific proteins that are causing the immune attack on the nerves, Lung function tests to check if breathing is affected,  Depending on the suspected cause of CIDP, other tests, such as  x-rays , imaging scans, and blood tests, may be done.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000839-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>The goal of treatment is to reverse the attack on the nerves. In some cases, nerves can heal and their function can be restored. In other cases, nerves are badly damaged and cannot heal, so treatment is aimed at preventing the disease from getting worse. Which treatment is given depends on how severe the symptoms are, among other things. The most aggressive treatment is only given if you have difficulty walking, breathing, or if symptoms don't allow you to care for yourself or work. Treatments may include: Corticosteroids to help reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms, Other medicines that suppress the immune system (for some severe cases), Plasmapheresis or plasma exchange to remove  antibodies  from the blood, Intravenous immune globulin (IVIg), which involves injecting antibodies into the bloodstream to reduce the effect of the antibodies that are causing the problem, </Answer>
