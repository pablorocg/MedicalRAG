			<Answer>A broken kneecap occurs when the small round bone (patella) that sits over the front of your knee joint breaks. Sometimes when a broken kneecap occurs, the patella or quadriceps tendon can also tear. The patella and quadriceps tendon connects the big muscle in the front of your thigh to your knee joint. </Answer>
