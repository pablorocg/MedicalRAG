			<Question qid="0002939-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Pantothenic acid and biotin</Question>
			<Answer>Pantothenic acid (B5) and biotin (B7) are types of B vitamins. They are water-soluble, which means that the body can't store them. If the body can't use the entire vitamin, the extra amount leaves the body through the urine. The body keeps a small reserve of these vitamins. They have to be taken on a regular basis to maintain the reserve.</Answer>
