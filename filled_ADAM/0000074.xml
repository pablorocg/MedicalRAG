			<Question qid="0000074-2" qtype="causes">What causes Acute cholecystitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The gallbladder is an organ that sits below the liver. It stores bile, which is produced in the liver. Your body uses bile to digest fats in the small intestine.  Acute cholecystitis occurs when  bile  becomes trapped in the gallbladder. This often happens because a  gallstone  blocks the cystic duct, the tube through which bile travels into and out of the gallbladder. When a stone blocks this duct, bile builds up, causing irritation and pressure in the gallbladder. This can lead to swelling and infection. Other causes include: Serious illnesses, such as HIV or diabetes, Tumors of the gallbladder (rare) ,  Some people are more at risk for gallstones. Risk factors include: Being female, Pregnancy, Hormone therapy, Older age, Being Native American or Hispanic, Obesity, Losing or gaining weight rapidly, Diabetes ,  Sometimes, the bile duct becomes blocked temporarily. When this occurs repeatedly, it can lead to  long-term (chronic) cholecystitis . This is swelling and irritation that continues over time. Eventually, the gallbladder becomes thick and hard. It does not store and release bile as well as it did. </Answer>
