			<Question qid="0002691-2" qtype="causes">What causes Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I ?</Question>
			<Answer>MEN I is caused by a defect in a gene that carries the code for a protein called menin. The condition causes tumors of various glands to appear in the same person, but not necessarily at the same time. The disorder may occur at any age, and it affects men and women equally. A family history of this disorder raises your risk.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002691-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I ?</Question>
			<Answer>Surgery to remove the diseased gland is often the treatment of choice. A medicine called bromocriptine may be used instead of surgery for pituitary tumors that release the hormone prolactin. The parathyroid glands, which control calcium production, can be removed. However, it is difficult for the body to regulate calcium levels without these glands, so a total parathyroid removal is not done first in most cases.  Medicine is available to decrease the excess stomach acid production caused by some tumors (gastrinomas), and to reduce the risk of ulcers. Hormone replacement therapy is given when entire glands are removed or do not produce enough hormones.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002691-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pituitary and parathyroid tumors are&#160;usually noncancerous ( benign ), but some pancreatic tumors may become cancerous (malignant) and spread to the liver. These can lower life expectancy. The symptoms of  peptic ulcer  disease, low blood sugar, excess calcium in the blood, and pituitary dysfunction usually respond well to appropriate treatment.</Answer>
