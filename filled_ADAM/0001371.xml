			<Question qid="0001371-2" qtype="causes">What causes Ellis-van Creveld syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ellis-van Creveld is passed down through families (inherited). It is caused by defects in 1 of 2 Ellis-van Creveld syndrome genes ( EVC  and  EVC2 ). These genes are positioned next to each other on the same chromosome. The severity of the disease varies from person to person. The highest rate of the condition is seen among the Old Order Amish population of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. It is fairly rare in the general population.</Answer>
