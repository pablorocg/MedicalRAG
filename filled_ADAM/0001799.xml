			<Question qid="0001799-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Halo brace</Question>
			<Answer>A halo brace holds your child's head and neck still so that bones and ligaments in the neck can heal. Your child's head and torso will move as one when your child is moving around. Your child can still do many activities when wearing the halo brace. There are two parts to a halo brace: The halo ring that goes around the forehead. The ring is attached to the head with small pins that anchor it into the bone of your child's head., A stiff vest that is worn under clothes. Four rods go down from the halo ring and connect to the shoulders of the vest. ,  Talk to your health care provider about how long your child will wear the halo brace. Children usually wear the brace for 2 to 4 months, depending on the injury and how fast it heals. The halo brace stays on at all times. Only the provider will take it off. Your provider will do x-rays to see if your child's neck has healed. The halo brace can be removed in the office. </Answer>
