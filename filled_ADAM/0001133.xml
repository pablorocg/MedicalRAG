			<Question qid="0001133-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Dementia due to metabolic causes ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dementia  is loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. Dementia may also be referred to as major  neurocognitive disorder . Dementia due to  metabolic  causes is a loss of brain function that can occur with abnormal chemical processes in the body.

			<Question qid="0001133-2" qtype="causes">What causes Dementia due to metabolic causes ?</Question>
			<Answer>Possible metabolic causes of dementia include: Hormonal disorders, such as  Addison disease ,  Cushing disease , Heavy metal exposure, such as to lead, arsenic, mercury, or manganese, Repeat episodes of low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ), most often seen in people with diabetes who use insulin, High level of calcium in the blood, such as due to  hyperparathyroidism , 
   Low level of thyroid hormone ( hypothyroidism ) or high level of thyroid hormone ( thyrotoxicosis ) in the body,  Liver cirrhosis ,  Kidney failure , Nutritional disorders, such as vitamin B1 deficiency,  vitamin B12  deficiency,  pellagra , or protein-calorie  malnutrition ,  Porphyria , Poisons, such as methanol, Severe alcohol use,  Wilson disease , Disorders of the mitochondria (energy-producing parts of cells), Rapid changes in sodium level , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001133-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Dementia due to metabolic causes ?</Question>
			<Answer>Metabolic disorders may cause  confusion  and changes in thinking or reasoning. These changes may be short-term or lasting. Dementia occurs when the symptoms are not reversible. Symptoms can be different for everyone. They depend on the health condition causing the dementia. The early symptoms of dementia can include: Difficulty with tasks that take some thought but used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routines, Getting lost on familiar routes, Language problems, such as trouble with names of familiar objects, Losing interest in things previously enjoyed, flat mood, Misplacing items, Personality changes and loss of social skills, which can lead to inappropriate behaviors, Mood changes that can cause periods of aggression and anxiety , Poor performance at work resulting in demotion or loss of job ,  As the dementia gets worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of yourself: Changing sleep patterns, often waking up at night, Forgetting details about current events, forgetting events in one's life history, Having difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, or driving, Having hallucinations, arguments, striking out, and behaving violently, More difficulty reading or writing, Poor judgment and losing the ability to recognize danger, Using the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, speaking in confusing sentences, Withdrawing from social contact,  The person may also have symptoms from the disorder that caused dementia.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001133-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Dementia due to metabolic causes ?</Question>
			<Answer>Depending on the cause, a nervous system (neurologic) examination is done to identify the problems. Tests to diagnose a medical condition causing the dementia may include: Ammonia level in the blood,  Blood chemistry , electrolytes,  Blood glucose level ,  BUN ,  creatinine  to check kidney function,  Liver function tests ,  Lumbar puncture  (spinal tap), Nutritional assessment,  Thyroid function tests ,  Urinalysis ,  Vitamin B12 level ,  To rule out certain brain disorders, an  EEG  (electroencephalogram),  head CT scan , or  head MRI scan  is usually done.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001133-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Dementia due to metabolic causes ?</Question>
			<Answer>The aim of treatment is to manage and correct the underlying disorder and control symptoms. With some metabolic disorders, treatment may stop or even reverse the dementia symptoms. Medicines used to treat  Alzheimer disease  have not been shown to work for these types of disorders. Sometimes, these drugs are used anyway, when other treatments fail to control the underlying problems. Plans should also be made for home care for people with dementia.</Answer>
