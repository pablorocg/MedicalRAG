			<Question qid="0003171-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Potassium carbonate poisoning</Question>
			<Answer>Potassium carbonate is a white powder used to make soap, glass, and other items. It is a chemical known as a caustic. If it contacts tissues, it can cause severe damage, such as burning or ulcers, on contact. This article discusses poisoning from swallowing or breathing in potassium carbonate. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
