			<Question qid="0000530-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Brain aneurysm repair ?</Question>
			<Answer>Brain aneurysm repair is surgery to correct an  aneurysm &#160;in or near the brain. This is a weak area in a blood vessel wall that causes the vessel to bulge or balloon out and sometimes burst (rupture). It may cause: Bleeding into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the brain (also called a  subarachnoid hemorrhage ), Bleeding into the brain that forms a collection of blood (hematoma) , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000530-7" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Brain aneurysm repair ?</Question>
			<Answer>After successful surgery for a bleeding aneurysm, it is uncommon for it to bleed again. The outlook also depends on whether brain damage occurred from bleeding before, during, or after surgery. Most of the time, surgery can prevent a brain aneurysm that has not caused symptoms from becoming larger and breaking open. You may have more than one aneurysm or the aneurysm that was coiled might grow back. After coiling repair, you will need to be seen by your provider every year.</Answer>
