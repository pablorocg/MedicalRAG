			<Answer>When listening to the heart with a stethoscope, the health care provider can hear a sound called a pericardial rub. The  heart sounds  may be muffled or distant. There may be other signs of excess fluid in the pericardium (pericardial effusion). If the disorder is severe, there may be: Crackles in the lungs, Decreased breath sounds, Other signs of fluid in the space around the lungs,  The following imaging tests may be done to check the heart and the tissue layer around it (pericardium): Chest MRI scan ,  Chest x-ray ,  Echocardiogram ,  Electrocardiogram ,  Heart MRI  or heart  CT  scan, Radionuclide scanning ,  To look for heart muscle damage, the provider may order a troponin I test.

			<Question qid="0003015-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Pericarditis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The cause of pericarditis should be identified, if possible. High doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen are often given with a medicine called colchicine. These medicines will decrease your pain and reduce the swelling or inflammation in the sac around your heart. You will be asked to take them for days to weeks or longer in some cases. If the cause of pericarditis is an infection: Antibiotics will be used for bacterial infections, Antifungal medicines will be used for fungal pericarditis ,  Other medicines that may be used are: Corticosteroids such as prednisone (in some people), "Water pills" (diuretics) to remove excess fluid ,  If the buildup of fluid makes the heart function poorly, treatment may include: Draining the fluid from the sac. This procedure, called  pericardiocentesis , may be done using a needle, which is guided by ultrasound (echocardiography) in most cases., Cutting a small hole (window) in the pericardium (subxiphoid pericardiotomy) to allow the infected fluid to drain into the abdominal cavity. This is done by a surgeon.,  Surgery called pericardiectomy may be needed if the pericarditis is long-lasting, comes back after treatment, or causes scarring or tightening of the tissue around the heart. The operation involves cutting or removing part of the pericardium. </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003015-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Pericarditis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pericarditis can range from mild illness that gets better on its own, to a life-threatening condition. Fluid buildup around the heart and poor heart function can complicate the disorder. The outcome is good if pericarditis is treated right away. Most people recover in 2 weeks to 3 months. However, pericarditis may come back. This is called recurrent, or chronic, if symptoms or episodes continue. Scarring and thickening of the sac-like covering and the heart muscle may occur when the problem is severe. This is called  constrictive pericarditis . It can cause long-term problems similar to those of heart failure.</Answer>
