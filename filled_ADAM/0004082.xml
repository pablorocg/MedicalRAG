			<Question qid="0004082-2" qtype="causes">What causes Unconsciousness - first aid ?</Question>
			<Answer>Unconsciousness can be caused by nearly any major illness or injury. It can also be caused by substance (drug) and alcohol use.  Choking on an object can result in unconsciousness  as well.  Brief unconsciousness (or  fainting ) is often a result from dehydration,  low blood sugar , or temporary low blood pressure. It can also be caused by serious heart or nervous system problems. A doctor will determine if the affected person needs tests to diagnose their fainting. Other causes of fainting include straining during a bowel movement or urination, coughing very hard, breathing very fast (hyperventilating), or vasovagal syncope.</Answer>
