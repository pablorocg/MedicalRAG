Other causes of bronchiectasis can include: Cystic fibrosis , a disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, Autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis,&#160; Sj&#246;gren syndrome &#160;or&#160;inflammatory bowel disease, Allergic lung diseases, Leukemia and related cancers, Immune deficiency syndromes, Primary ciliary dyskinesia (another congenital disease), Infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria, As a complication of bronchiolitis obliterans, Asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease (uncommon), </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000590-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Bronchiectasis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment is aimed at: Controlling infections and sputum, Relieving  airway blockage , Preventing the problem from becoming worse, Treating the underlying cause (for example modulator therapy for people with cystic fibrosis) ,  Daily drainage to remove sputum is part of treatment. A respiratory therapist can show the person coughing exercises that will help. Medicines are often prescribed. These include: Antibiotics to treat infections, Bronchodilators to open up airways, Expectorants to help loosen and cough up thick sputum,  Surgery to remove ( resect ) the lung may be needed if medicine does not work and the disease is in a small area, or if the person has a lot of bleeding in the lungs. It is more commonly considered if there is no genetic or acquired predisposition to bronchiectasis (for example, more likely to consider if there is bronchiectasis in one segment of the lung only because of prior obstruction). In severe cases, lung transplantation might be needed.&#160;</Answer>
