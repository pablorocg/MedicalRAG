			<Question qid="0000230-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Angioplasty and stent placement - carotid artery</Question>
			<Answer>The blood vessels that bring blood to your brain and face are called the carotid arteries. You have a carotid artery on each side of your neck.  The blood flow in this artery can become partly or totally blocked by fatty material called plaque. A partial blockage is called carotid artery stenosis (narrowing). A blockage in your carotid artery can reduce the blood supply to your brain. Sometimes part of a plaque can break off, travel downstream and block a brain artery. A stroke can occur if your brain does not get enough blood. Two procedures can be used to treat a carotid artery that is narrowed or blocked. These are: Surgery to remove plaque buildup ( endarterectomy ), Carotid artery angioplasty with stent placement , </Answer>
