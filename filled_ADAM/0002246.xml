			<Question qid="0002246-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Isolation precautions</Question>
			<Answer>Isolation precautions create barriers between people and germs. These types of precautions help prevent the spread of germs in the hospital. Anybody who visits a hospital patient who has an isolation sign outside their door should stop at the nurses' station before entering the patient's room. The number of visitors and staff who enter the patient's room may be limited. Different types of isolation precautions protect against different types of germs.</Answer>
