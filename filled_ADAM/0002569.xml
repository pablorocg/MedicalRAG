			<Question qid="0002569-2" qtype="causes">What causes Melanoma of the eye ?</Question>
			<Answer>Melanoma  is a very aggressive type of cancer that can spread rapidly. It usually is a type of skin cancer. Melanoma of the eye can affect several parts of the eye, including the: Choroid , Ciliary body, Conjunctiva, Eyelid, Iris, Orbit ,  The choroid layer is the most likely site of melanoma in the eye. This is the layer of blood vessels and connective tissue between the white of the eye and retina (back of the eye). The cancer may only be in the eye. Or, it may spread (metastasize) to another location in the body, most commonly the liver. Melanoma can also begin on the skin or other organs in the body and spread to the eye. Melanoma is the most common type of eye tumor in adults. Even so, melanoma that starts in the eye is rare. Too much exposure to sunlight is an important risk factor for melanoma. People who have fair skin and blue eyes are most affected.</Answer>
