			<Question qid="0002798-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Niacin</Question>
			<Answer>Niacin is a type of B vitamin. It is a water-soluble vitamin. It is not stored in the body. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. The body keeps a small reserve of these vitamins, but they have to be taken on a regular basis to maintain the reserve.</Answer>
