			<Question qid="0000189-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Aminophylline overdose ?</Question>
			<Answer>Aminophylline and theophylline are medicines used to treat lung diseases such as asthma. They help prevent and treat wheezing and other breathing problems, including respiratory distress associated with premature birth. Aminophylline or theophylline  overdose  occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of these medicines. This can be done by accident or on purpose. Aminophylline may interact with other medications, resulting in higher blood levels and increasing the risk of side effects. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with has an overdose, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
