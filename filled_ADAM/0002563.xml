			<Question qid="0002563-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Mediterranean diet</Question>
			<Answer>The Mediterranean-style diet has fewer meats and carbohydrates than a typical American diet. It also has more plant-based foods and  monounsaturated (good) fat . People who live in Italy, Spain, and other countries in the Mediterranean region have eaten this way for centuries. Following the Mediterranean diet may lead to more stable blood sugar, lower cholesterol and triglycerides, and a lower  risk for heart disease  and other health problems.</Answer>
