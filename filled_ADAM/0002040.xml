			<Question qid="0002040-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about How to use an inhaler - with spacer</Question>
			<Answer>Metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) usually have 3 parts: A mouthpiece, A cap that goes over the mouthpiece, A canister full of medicine ,  If you use your inhaler the wrong way, less medicine gets to your lungs. A spacer device will help. The spacer connects to the mouthpiece. The inhaled medicine goes into the spacer tube first. Then you take two deep breaths to get the medicine into your lungs. Using a spacer wastes a lot less medicine than spraying the medicine into your mouth. Spacers come in different shapes and sizes. Ask your provider which spacer is best for you or your child. Almost all children can use a spacer. You do not need a spacer for dry powder inhalers. The steps below tell you how to take your medicine with a spacer.</Answer>
