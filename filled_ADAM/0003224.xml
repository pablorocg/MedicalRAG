			<Question qid="0003224-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Primary biliary cirrhosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The bile ducts are tubes that move  bile  from the liver to the small intestine. Bile is a substance that helps with digestion. All of the bile ducts together are called the biliary tract. When the bile ducts become swollen or inflamed, this blocks the flow of bile. These changes can lead to scarring of the liver called cirrhosis. This is called biliary cirrhosis. Advanced cirrhosis can lead to liver failure.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003224-2" qtype="causes">What causes Primary biliary cirrhosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The cause of inflamed bile ducts in the liver is not known. However, primary biliary cholangitis is an autoimmune disorder. That means your body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. The disease may be linked to  autoimmune disorders  such as: Celiac disease ,  Raynaud phenomenon , Sicca syndrome (dry eyes or mouth), Thyroid disease ,  The disease most often affects middle-aged women.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003224-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Primary biliary cirrhosis ?</Question>

The following tests can check to see if your liver is working properly: Albumin blood test,  Liver function tests  (serum alkaline phosphatase is most important), Prothrombin time ( PT ), Cholesterol and lipoprotein blood tests ,  Other tests that can help measure how severe liver disease may be include: Elevated immunoglobulin M level in the blood,  Liver biopsy ,  Anti-mitochondrial antibodies  (results are positive in about 95% of cases), Special types of ultrasound or MRI that measure the amount of scar tissue (may be called elastography), Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003224-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Primary biliary cirrhosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The goal of treatment is to ease symptoms and prevent complications. Cholestyramine (or colestipol) may reduce the itching. Ursodeoxycholic acid may improve removal of bile from the bloodstream. This may improve survival in some people. A newer drug called obeticholic acid (Ocaliva) is also available. Vitamin replacement therapy restores vitamins A, K, E and D, which are lost in fatty stools. A calcium supplement or other bone medicines may be added to prevent or treat  weak or soft bones . Long-term  monitoring and treatment of liver failure  is needed. Liver transplant  may be successful if it is done before liver failure occurs. </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003224-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Primary biliary cirrhosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The outcome can vary. If the condition is not treated, most people will die without a liver transplant. About one quarter of people who have had the disease for 10 years will have liver failure. Doctors can now use a statistical model to predict the best time to do the transplant. Other diseases, such as hypothyroidism and anemia, can also develop.</Answer>
