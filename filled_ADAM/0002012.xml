			<Question qid="0002012-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Hormone therapy for breast cancer ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hormone therapy to treat  breast cancer  uses drugs or treatments to lower levels or block the action of female sex hormones (estrogen and progesterone) in a woman's body. This helps slow the growth of many breast cancers.  Hormone therapy makes cancer less likely to return after breast cancer surgery. It also slows the growth of breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.  Hormone therapy can also be used to help prevent cancer in women at high risk for breast cancer. It is different from hormone therapy to treat  menopause  symptoms.</Answer>
