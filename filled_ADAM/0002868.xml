			<Question qid="0002868-2" qtype="causes">What causes Orbital cellulitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Orbital cellulitis is a dangerous infection, which can cause lasting problems. Orbital cellulitis is different than  periorbital cellulitis , which is an infection of the eyelid or skin around the eye. In children, it often starts out as a sinus infection from bacteria such as  Haemophilus influenza.  The infection used to be more common in young children, under the age of 7. It is now rare due to a vaccine that helps prevent this infection. The bacteria  Staphylococcus aureus ,  Streptococcus pneumoniae , and beta-hemolytic streptococci may also cause orbital cellulitis. Orbital cellulitis infections in children may get worse very quickly and can lead to visual difficulties or blindness. Medical care is needed right away.</Answer>
