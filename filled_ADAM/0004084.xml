			<Question qid="0004084-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Understanding cardiovascular disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cardiovascular disease is the broad term for problems with the heart and blood vessels. These problems are often due to  atherosclerosis . This condition occurs when fat and  cholesterol  build up in blood vessel (artery) walls. This buildup is called plaque. Over time, plaque can narrow blood vessels and cause problems throughout the body. If an artery becomes blocked, it can lead to heart attack or stroke.</Answer>
