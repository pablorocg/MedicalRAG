			<Question qid="0000289-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Aortic valve surgery - minimally invasive</Question>
			<Answer>Blood flows out of your heart and into a large blood vessel called the aorta. The aortic valve separates the heart and aorta. The aortic valve opens so blood can flow out. It then closes to keep blood from returning to the heart.  You may need aortic valve surgery to replace the aortic valve in your heart if:  Your aortic valve does not close all the way, so blood leaks back into the heart. This is called aortic regurgitation., Your aortic valve does not open fully, so blood flow out of the heart is reduced. This is called aortic stenosis. ,  The aortic valve can be replaced using: Minimally invasive aortic valve surgery, done using one or more small cuts,  Open aortic valve surgery , done by making a large cut in your chest , </Answer>
