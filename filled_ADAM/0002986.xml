			<Question qid="0002986-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Pelvic CT scan</Question>
			<Answer>A  computed tomography (CT) scan  of the pelvis is an imaging method that uses  x-rays  to create cross-sectional pictures of the area between the hip bones. This part of the body is called the pelvic area. Structures inside and near the pelvis include the bladder, prostate and other male reproductive organs, female reproductive organs, lymph nodes, small intestine, colon, and pelvic bones. Single CT images are called slices. The images are stored on a computer, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Three-dimensional models of the body area can be created by stacking the slices together.</Answer>
