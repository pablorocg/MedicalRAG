			<Question qid="0000481-4" qtype="when to contact a medical professional">Do I need to see a doctor for Blindness and vision loss ?</Question>
			<Answer>Sudden vision loss is always an emergency, even if you have not completely lost vision. You should never ignore vision loss, thinking it will get better. Contact an ophthalmologist or go to the emergency room immediately. Most serious forms of vision loss are painless, and the absence of pain in no way diminishes the urgent need to get medical care. Many forms of vision loss only give you a short amount of time to be successfully treated.</Answer>
