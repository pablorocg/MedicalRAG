			<Question qid="0004289-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Wet to dry dressing changes</Question>
			<Answer>Your health care provider has covered your wound with a wet-to-dry dressing. With this type of dressing, a wet (or moist) gauze dressing is put on your wound and allowed to dry. Wound drainage and dead tissue can be removed when you take off the old dressing. Follow any instructions you are given on how to change the dressing. Use this sheet as a reminder.</Answer>
