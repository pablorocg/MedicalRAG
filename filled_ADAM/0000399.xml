			<Question qid="0000399-2" qtype="causes">What causes Bartter syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>There are five gene defects known to be associated with Bartter syndrome. The condition is present at birth (congenital). The condition is caused by a defect in the kidneys' ability to reabsorb sodium. People affected by Bartter syndrome lose too much sodium through the urine. This causes a rise in the level of the hormone aldosterone, and makes the kidneys remove too much potassium from the body. This is known as potassium wasting. The condition also results in an abnormal acid balance in the blood called hypokalemic alkalosis, which causes too much calcium in the urine.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000399-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Bartter syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Bartter syndrome is usually suspected when a blood test finds a  low level of potassium in the blood . Unlike other forms of kidney disease, this condition does not cause high blood pressure. There is a tendency toward low blood pressure. Laboratory tests may show: High levels of  potassium , calcium, and  chloride in the urine , High levels of the hormones,  renin  and aldosterone, in the blood, Low blood chloride, Metabolic  alkalosis ,  These same signs and symptoms can also occur in people who take too many diuretics (water pills) or laxatives. Urine tests can be done to rule out other causes. An ultrasound of the kidneys may be done.</Answer>
