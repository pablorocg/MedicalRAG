			<Question qid="0000733-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Central venous catheters - ports</Question>
			<Answer>A central venous catheter is a tube that goes into a vein in your arm or chest and ends at the right side of your heart (right atrium). If the catheter is in your chest, sometimes it is attached to a device called a port that will be under your skin. The port and catheter are put in place in a minor surgery. The catheter helps carry nutrients and medicine into your body. It can also be used to take blood when you need to have blood tests. Having a port attached to your catheter will cause less wear and tear on your veins than just having the catheter.</Answer>
