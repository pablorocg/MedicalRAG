			<Question qid="0001184-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Diabetes - taking care of your feet ?</Question>
			<Answer>Diabetes  can damage the nerves and blood vessels in your feet. This damage can cause numbness and reduce feeling in your feet. As a result, your feet are more likely to become injured and may not heal well if they are injured. If you get a blister, you may not notice and it may get worse. Even small sores or blisters can become big problems if infection develops or they don't heal. A  diabetic foot ulcer  can result. Foot ulcers are a common reason for hospital stays for people with diabetes. Taking good care of your feet can help prevent diabetic foot ulcers. Untreated foot ulcers are the most common reason for toe, foot, and leg amputations in people with diabetes.</Answer>
