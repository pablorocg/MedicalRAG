			<Question qid="0000347-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Ataxia - telangiectasia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare childhood disease. It affects the brain and other parts of the body. Ataxia refers to uncoordinated movements, such as walking. Telangiectasias are enlarged blood vessels (capillaries) just below the surface of the skin. Telangiectasias appear as tiny, red, spider-like blood vessels.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000347-2" qtype="causes">What causes Ataxia - telangiectasia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ataxia-telangiectasia is inherited. This means it is passed down through families. It is an  autosomal recessive  trait. Both parents must provide a copy of a nonworking gene for the child to have symptoms of the disorder. The disease results from a variant in the  ATM  gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control the rate at which cells grow and divide. Defects in this gene can lead to abnormal cell death in many sites of the body, including the part of the brain that helps coordinate movement. Boys and girls are equally affected.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000347-7" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Ataxia - telangiectasia ?</Question>
