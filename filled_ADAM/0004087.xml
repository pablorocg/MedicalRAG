			<Question qid="0004087-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Understanding your breast cancer risk ?</Question>
			<Answer>Breast cancer risk factors are things that increase the chance that you could get cancer. Some risk factors you can control, such as drinking alcohol. Others, such as family history, you cannot control. The more risk factors you have, the more your risk increases. However, it does not mean you absolutely will get cancer. Many women who get  breast cancer  do not have any known risk factors or a family history. Understanding your risk factors can give you a better picture of what you can do to help prevent breast cancer.</Answer>
