			<Question qid="0002870-2" qtype="causes">What causes Orchitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Orchitis may be caused by an infection. Many types of bacteria and viruses can cause this condition. The most common virus that causes orchitis is  mumps . It most often occurs in boys after puberty. Orchitis most often develops 4 to 6 days after the mumps begins. Orchitis may also occur along with infections of the prostate or epididymis. Orchitis may be caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as  gonorrhea  or  chlamydia . The rate of sexually transmitted orchitis or epididymitis is higher in men ages 19 to 35. Risk factors for sexually transmitted orchitis include: High-risk sexual behaviors, Multiple sexual partners, Personal history of gonorrhea or another STI, Sexual partner with a diagnosed STI ,  Risk factors for orchitis not due to an STI include: Being older than age 45, Long-term use of a  Foley catheter , Not being vaccinated against the mumps virus, Problems of the urinary tract that were present at birth (congenital), Repeated  urinary tract infections , Surgery of the urinary tract (genitourinary surgery), BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) - enlarged prostate, Urethral stricture (scarring inside urinary tract that causes narrowing of the passageway), </Answer>

	<QAPair pid="6">
			<Question qid="0002870-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Orchitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Getting the right diagnosis and treatment for orchitis caused by bacteria can most often allow the testicle to recover normally.  You will need further testing to rule out testicular cancer if the testicle does not completely return to normal after treatment.  Mumps orchitis has no effective treatment, and the outcome can vary. Men who have had mumps orchitis can become sterile.</Answer>

	<QAPair pid="7">
			<Question qid="0002870-7" qtype="complications">What are the complications of Orchitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Some boys who get orchitis caused by mumps will have shrinking of the testicles (testicular atrophy). Orchitis may also cause  infertility . Other potential complications include: Chronic epididymitis, Death of testicle tissue (testicular infarction),  Fistula  on the skin of the scrotum (cutaneous scrotal fistula), Scrotal  abscess ,  Acute  pain in the scrotum or testicles can be caused by twisting of the testicular blood vessels (torsion). This is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgery. A swollen testicle with little or no pain may be a sign of testicular cancer. If this is the case, you should have a testicular ultrasound. </Answer>
