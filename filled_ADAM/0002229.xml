			<Question qid="0002229-2" qtype="causes">What causes Intussusception - children ?</Question>

The pressure created by the walls of the intestine pressing together causes: Decreased blood flow, Irritation, Swelling ,  Intussusception can block the passage of food through the intestine. If the blood supply is cut off, the segment of intestine pulled inside can die. Heavy bleeding may also occur. If a hole develops, infection,  shock , and  dehydration  can take place very rapidly.

			<Question qid="0002229-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Intussusception - children ?</Question>
			<Answer>The child will first be stabilized. A tube will be passed into the stomach through the nose (nasogastric tube). An intravenous (IV) line will be placed in the arm, and fluids will be given to prevent dehydration. In some cases, the  bowel blockage  can be treated with an air or contrast enema. This is done by a radiologist skilled with the procedure. There is a risk of bowel tearing (perforation) with this procedure.  The child will need surgery if these treatments do not work. The bowel tissue can very often be saved. Dead tissue will be removed. Antibiotics may be needed to treat any infection. Intravenous  feeding and fluids will be continued until the child has a normal bowel movement.</Answer>
