			<Question qid="0001612-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Focal neurological deficits</Question>
			<Answer>A focal  neurologic deficit  is a problem with nerve, spinal cord, or brain function. It affects a specific location, such as the left side of the face, right arm, or even a small area such as the tongue. Speech, vision, and hearing problems are also considered focal neurological deficits. The type, location, and severity of the problem can indicate which area of the brain or nervous system is affected. In contrast, a non-focal problem is NOT specific to a certain area of the brain. It may include a general  loss of consciousness  or emotional problem.</Answer>
