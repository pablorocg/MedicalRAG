			<Question qid="0002454-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Lung cancer ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lung cancer is cancer that starts in the lungs. The lungs are located in the chest. When you breathe, air goes through your nose, down your windpipe (trachea), and into the lungs, where it flows through tubes called bronchi. Most lung cancer begins in the cells that line these tubes. There are two main types of lung cancer: Non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer.,  Small cell lung cancer  (SCLC) makes up about 20% of all lung cancer cases. ,  If the lung cancer is made up of both types, it is called mixed small cell/large cell cancer. If the cancer started somewhere else in the body and spreads to the lungs, it is called  metastatic cancer to the lung .</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002454-2" qtype="causes">What causes Lung cancer ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lung cancer is the deadliest type of cancer for both men and women. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined. Lung cancer is more common in older adults. It is rare in people under age 45. Smoking causes most cases (around 90%) of lung cancer. The risk depends on the number of cigarettes you smoke each day and for how long you have smoked. Being around the smoke from other people (secondhand smoke) also raises your risk of lung cancer. The risk does decrease with time after you stop smoking. But some people who have never smoked do develop lung cancer. There is no evidence that smoking low-tar cigarettes lowers the risk. Research shows that smoking marijuana may help cancer cells grow. But there is no direct link between smoking marijuana and developing lung cancer. Constant exposure to high levels of air pollution and drinking water that has a high level of arsenic can increase your risk of lung cancer. A history of radiation therapy to the lungs can also increase risk. Working with or living near cancer-causing chemicals or materials can also increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Such chemicals include: Arsenic, Asbestos, Radon, Chemicals such as uranium, beryllium, vinyl chloride, nickel chromates, coal products, mustard gas, chloromethyl ethers, gasoline, and diesel exhaust, Certain alloys, paints, pigments, and preservatives, Products using chloride and formaldehyde, </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002454-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Lung cancer ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lung cancer is often found when an x-ray or CT scan is done for another reason. If lung cancer is suspected, your provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history. You will be asked if you smoke. If so, you'll be asked how much you smoke and for how long you have smoked. You will also be asked about other things that may have put you at risk for lung cancer, such as exposure to certain chemicals. When listening to the chest with a stethoscope, the provider may hear fluid around the lungs. This may suggest cancer. Tests that may be done to diagnose lung cancer or see if it has spread include: Bone scan ,  Chest x-ray ,  Complete blood count  (CBC),  CT scan of the chest ,  MRI of the chest ,  Positron emission tomography  (PET) scan, Sputum test to look for cancer cells,  Thoracentesis  (sampling of fluid buildup around the lung),  In most cases, a piece of tissue is removed from your lungs for examination under a microscope. This is called a biopsy. There are several ways to do this: Bronchoscopy  combined with biopsy, CT-scan-directed needle biopsy, Endoscopic bronchoscopy ultrasound (EBUS) with biopsy,  Mediastinoscopy  with biopsy,  Open lung biopsy ,  Pleural biopsy ,  If the biopsy shows cancer, more imaging tests are done to find out the stage of the cancer. Stage means how big the tumor is and how far it has spread. Staging helps guide treatment and follow-up and gives you an idea of what to expect.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002454-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Lung cancer ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment for lung cancer depends on the type of cancer, how advanced it is, and how healthy you are: Surgery to remove the tumor may be done when it has not spread beyond nearby lymph nodes.,  Chemotherapy  uses medicines to kill cancer cells and stop new cells from growing.,  Radiation therapy  uses powerful x-rays or other forms of radiation to kill cancer cells. ,  The above treatments may be done alone or in combination. Your provider can tell you more about the specific treatment you will receive, depending on the specific type of lung cancer and what stage it is.</Answer>
