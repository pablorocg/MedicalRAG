			<Question qid="0002694-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Multiple sclerosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an  autoimmune disease  that affects the  brain and spinal cord  (central nervous system).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002694-2" qtype="causes">What causes Multiple sclerosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>MS affects women more often than men. The disorder is most commonly diagnosed between ages 30 to 40, but it can be seen at any age. MS is caused by damage to the myelin sheath. This sheath is the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. When this nerve covering is damaged, nerve signals slow or stop. The nerve damage is caused by inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system. This can occur along any area of the brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord. It is unknown what exactly causes MS. The most common thought is that it is caused by a virus, a gene defect, or both. Environmental factors may also play a role. You are slightly more likely to develop this condition if you have a family history of MS or you live in a part of the world where MS is more common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002694-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Multiple sclerosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Symptoms vary because the location and severity of each attack can be different. Attacks can last for days, weeks, or months. Attacks are followed by remissions. These are periods of reduced symptoms or no symptoms. Fever, hot baths, sun exposure, and stress can trigger or worsen attacks. Nerves in any part of the brain or spinal cord may be damaged. Because of this, MS symptoms can appear in many parts of the body. Muscle symptoms: Loss of balance,  Muscle spasms ,  Numbness  or abnormal sensation in any area, Problems moving arms or legs, Problems walking, Problems with  coordination  and making small movements,  Tremor  in one or more arms or legs,  Weakness  in one or more arms or legs ,  Bowel and bladder symptoms: Constipation  and stool leakage, Difficulty beginning to urinate,  Frequent need to urinate , Strong urge to urinate,  Urine leakage  (incontinence) ,  Eye symptoms: Double vision ,  Eye discomfort ,  Uncontrollable eye movements ,  Vision loss  (usually affects one eye at a time) ,  Numbness, tingling, or pain: Facial pain , Painful  muscle spasms , Tingling, crawling, or burning feeling in the arms and legs ,  Other brain and nerve symptoms: Decreased attention span, poor judgment, and memory loss, Difficulty reasoning and solving problems,  Depression  or feelings of sadness,  Dizziness  and balance problems,  Hearing loss ,  Sexual symptoms: Problems with erections , Problems with vaginal lubrication ,  Speech and swallowing symptoms: Slurred or difficult-to-understand speech, Trouble chewing and swallowing ,  Fatigue  is a common and bothersome symptom as MS progresses. It is often worse in the late afternoon.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002694-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Multiple sclerosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Symptoms of MS may mimic those of many other nervous system problems. MS is diagnosed by determining if there are signs of more than one attack on the brain or spinal cord and by ruling out other conditions. People who have a form of MS called relapsing-remitting MS have evidence of at least two attacks separated by a remission. In other people, the disease may slowly get worse in between clear attacks. This form is called secondary progressive MS. A form with gradual progression, but no clear attacks is called primary progressive MS. Your health care provider may suspect MS if there are decreases in the function of two different parts of the central nervous system (such as abnormal reflexes) at two different times. An exam of the nervous system may show reduced nerve function in one area of the body. Or the reduced nerve function may be spread over many parts of the body. This may include: Abnormal nerve reflexes, Decreased ability to move a part of the body, Decreased or abnormal sensation, Other loss of nervous system functions, such as vision ,  An eye exam may show: Abnormal pupil responses, Changes in the  visual fields  or eye movements, Damage to the nerve in the eye (optic nerve atrophy),  Decreased visual acuity , Problems with the inside parts of the eye, Rapid eye movements triggered when the eye moves ,  Tests to diagnose MS include: Blood tests to check for other conditions that are similar to MS.,  Lumbar puncture  (spinal tap) for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests, including CSF oligoclonal banding may be needed.,  MRI scan of the brain or the spine, or both  are important to help diagnose and follow MS., Nerve function study (evoked potential test, such as visual evoked response) is less often used. , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002694-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Multiple sclerosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>There is no known cure for MS at this time, but there are treatments that may slow the disease. The goal of treatment is to stop progression, control symptoms, and help you maintain a normal quality of life. Medicines are often taken long-term. These include: Medicines to slow the disease, Steroids to decrease the severity of attacks, Medicines to control symptoms such as muscle spasms, urinary problems, fatigue, or mood problems ,  Medicines are more effective for the relapsing-remitting form than for other forms of MS. The following may also be  helpful for people with MS : Physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and support groups, Assistive devices, such as wheelchairs, bed lifts, shower chairs, walkers, and wall bars, A planned exercise program early in the course of the disorder, A healthy lifestyle, with good nutrition and enough rest and relaxation, Avoiding fatigue, stress, temperature extremes, and illness, Changes in  what you eat or drink if there are swallowing problems , Making changes around the home to  prevent falls , Social workers or other counseling services to help you cope with the disorder and get assistance, Vitamin D or other supplements (talk to your provider first), Complementary and alternative approaches, such as acupuncture or cannabis, to help with muscle problems, Spinal devices can reduce pain and spasticity in the legs, </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002694-6" qtype="support groups">Where to find support for people with Multiple sclerosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Living with MS may be a challenge. You can ease the stress of illness by joining an  MS support group . Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002694-7" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Multiple sclerosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The outcome varies, and is hard to predict. Although the disorder is life-long ( chronic ) and incurable, life expectancy can be normal or almost normal. Most people with MS are active and function at work with little disability. Those who usually have the best outlook are: Females, People who were young (less than 30 years old) when the disease started, People with infrequent attacks, People with a relapsing-remitting pattern, People who have limited disease on imaging studies ,  The amount of disability and discomfort depends on: How often and severe the attacks are, The part of the central nervous system that is affected by each attack ,  Most people return to normal or near-normal function between attacks. Over time, there is greater loss of function with less improvement between attacks.</Answer>
