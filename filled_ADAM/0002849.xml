			<Answer>Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of  polyunsaturated fat . We need these fats to build brain cells and for other important functions. Omega-3s help keep your heart healthy and protected against stroke. They also help improve your heart health if you already have heart disease. Your body does not make omega-3 fatty acids on its own. You need to get them from your diet. Certain fish are the best sources of omega-3s. You can also get them from some plant foods. Omega-3 fatty acids should make up 5% to 10% of your total calories.</Answer>
