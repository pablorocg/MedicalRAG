			<Question qid="0000927-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Compazine overdose</Question>
			<Answer>Prochlorperazine is a medicine used to treat severe nausea and vomiting. It is a member of the class of medicines called phenothiazines, some of which are used to treat mental disturbances. Prochlorperazine overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with has overdosed, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
