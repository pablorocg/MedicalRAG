			<Question qid="0000424-2" qtype="causes">What causes Benign positional vertigo ?</Question>
			<Answer>Benign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It is caused by a problem in the inner ear.  The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. When you move, the fluid moves inside these tubes. The canals are very sensitive to any movement of the fluid. The sensation of the fluid moving in the tube tells your brain the position of your body. This helps you keep your balance. BPPV occurs when small pieces of bone-like calcium (called canaliths) break free and float inside the tube. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position. BPPV has no major risk factors. But, your risk of developing BPPV may increase if you have: Family members with BPPV, Had a prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head), Had an inner ear infection called  labyrinthitis , </Answer>

Your provider holds your head in a certain position. Then you are asked to lie quickly backward over a table., As you do this, your provider will look for abnormal eye movements (called  nystagmus ) and ask if you feel like you are spinning. ,  If this test doesn't show a clear result, you may be asked to do other tests.  You may have brain and nervous system (neurological) tests to rule out other causes. These may include: Electronystagmography  (ENG),  Head CT  scan,  Head MRI  scan,  Hearing test ,  Magnetic resonance angiography  of the head, Warming and cooling the inner ear with water or air to test eye movements ( caloric stimulation ), </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000424-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Benign positional vertigo ?</Question>
			<Answer>Your provider may perform a procedure called the  Epley maneuver . It is a series of head movements to reposition the canaliths in your inner ear. The procedure may need to be repeated if symptoms come back, but this treatment works best to cure BPPV. Your provider may teach you other repositioning exercises that you can do at home, but may take longer than the Epley maneuver to work. Other exercises, such as balance therapy, may help some people. Some medicines can help relieve spinning sensations: Antihistamines, Anticholinergics, Sedative-hypnotics,  But, these medicines often do not work well for treating vertigo. Follow instructions on how to take  care for yourself at home . To keep your symptoms from getting worse, avoid the positions that trigger it.</Answer>
