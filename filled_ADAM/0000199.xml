			<Question qid="0000199-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Amylase - blood</Question>
			<Answer>Amylase is an  enzyme  that helps digest carbohydrates. It is made primarily in the pancreas and the glands that make saliva, and can be found at low levels in other parts of the body. When the pancreas is diseased or inflamed, it releases increased amounts of amylase into the blood. A test can be done to measure the level of this enzyme in your blood. Amylase may also be measured with a  urine amylase test .</Answer>
