			<Question qid="0001615-2" qtype="causes">What causes Folate-deficiency anemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Folate (folic acid) is needed for red blood cells to form and grow. You can get folate by eating green leafy vegetables and liver. However, your body does not store folate in large amounts. So, you need to eat plenty of folate-rich foods to maintain normal levels of this vitamin. In  folate-deficiency  anemia, the red blood cells are abnormally large. Such cells are called macrocytes. They are also called megaloblasts, when they are seen in the bone marrow. That is why this anemia is also called megaloblastic anemia. Causes of this type of anemia include: Too little folic acid in your diet,  Hemolytic anemia , Long-term  alcoholism , Use of certain medicines (such as phenytoin [Dilantin], methotrexate, sulfasalazine, triamterene, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and barbiturates) ,  The following raise your risk for this type of anemia: Alcoholism, Eating overcooked food, Poor diet (often seen in the poor, the older people, and people who do not eat fresh fruits or vegetables), Pregnancy, Weight loss diets,  Folic acid is needed to help a baby in the womb grow properly. Too little  folic acid during pregnancy  may lead to birth defects in a baby. </Answer>
