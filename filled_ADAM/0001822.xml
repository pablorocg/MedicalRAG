			<Question qid="0001822-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Head circumference ?</Question>
			<Answer>During routine checkups, the distance is measured in centimeters or inches and compared with: Past measurements of a child's head circumference., Normal ranges for a child's sex and age (weeks, months), based on values that experts have obtained for normal growth rates of infants' and children's heads. ,  Measurement of the head circumference is an important part of routine well-baby care. During the well-baby exam, a change from the expected normal head growth may alert the health care provider of a possible problem. For example, a head that is larger than normal or that is increasing in size faster than normal may be a sign of several problems, including water on the brain (hydrocephalus). A very small head size (called  microcephaly ) or very slow growth rate may be a sign that the brain is not developing properly.</Answer>
