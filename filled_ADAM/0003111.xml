			<Question qid="0003111-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Plastic resin hardener poisoning</Question>
			<Answer>Poisoning can occur from swallowing plastic resin hardener. Resin hardener fumes may also be poisonous. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
