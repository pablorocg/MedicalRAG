			<Question qid="0001946-2" qtype="causes">What causes Hepatorenal syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hepatorenal syndrome occurs when the kidneys stop working well in people with serious liver problems. Less urine is produced by the body, so waste products that contain nitrogen build up in the bloodstream ( azotemia ). The disorder occurs in up to 1 in 10 people who are in the hospital with liver failure. It leads to  kidney failure  in people with: Acute liver failure, Alcoholic  hepatitis ,  Cirrhosis ,  Infected abdominal fluid &#160;(peritonitis),  Risk factors include: Blood pressure that falls when a person rises or suddenly changes position (orthostatic hypotension), Use of medicines called diuretics ("water pills"), Gastrointestinal bleeding, Infection, Recent  abdominal fluid removal  (paracentesis) , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001946-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Hepatorenal syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>The goal of treatment is to help the liver work better and to make sure the heart is able to pump enough blood to the body.  Treatment is about the same as for kidney failure from any cause. It includes: Stopping all unnecessary medicines, especially ibuprofen and other NSAIDs, certain antibiotics, and diuretics ("water pills"), Having dialysis to improve symptoms, Taking medicines to improve blood pressure and help your kidneys work better; infusion of albumin may also be helpful, Placing a shunt (known as TIPS) to relieve the symptoms of ascites (this may also help kidney function,&#160;but the procedure can be risky), Surgery to place a shunt&#160;from the abdominal space to the jugular vein to relieve some symptoms of kidney failure (this procedure is risky and is rarely done), </Answer>
