			<Question qid="0001793-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Hair spray poisoning</Question>
			<Answer>Hair spray poisoning occurs when someone breathes in (inhales) hair spray or sprays it down their throat or into their eyes. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
