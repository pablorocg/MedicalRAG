			<Question qid="0004041-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Trisomy 18 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Trisomy 18 is a genetic disorder in which a person has a third copy of material from  chromosome  18, instead of the usual 2 copies. Rarely, the extra material may be attached to another chromosome (translocation). Most cases are not passed down through families. Instead, the problems that lead to this condition occur in either the sperm or the egg that forms the fetus.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004041-2" qtype="causes">What causes Trisomy 18 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Trisomy 18 occurs in 1 in 6000 live births. It is 3 times more common in girls than boys.  The syndrome occurs when there is extra material from chromosome 18. The extra material affects normal development. Trisomy 18: the presence of an extra (third) chromosome 18 in all of the cells., Mosaic trisomy 18: the presence of an extra chromosome 18 in some of the cells., Partial trisomy 18: the presence of a part of an extra chromosome 18 in the cells.,  Most cases of Trisomy 18 are not passed down through families (inherited). Instead, the events that lead to trisomy 18 occur in either the sperm or the egg that forms the fetus.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004041-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Trisomy 18 ?</Question>
			<Answer>An exam during pregnancy may show an unusually large uterus and extra  amniotic fluid . There may be an unusually small placenta when the baby is born. A physical exam of the infant may show unusual facial features and fingerprint patterns. X-rays may show a short breast bone. Chromosome studies  will show trisomy 18. The chromosome abnormality may be present in every cell or present in only a certain percentage of the cells (called mosaicism). Studies may also show part of the chromosome in some cells. Rarely, part of the chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome. This is called  translocation . Other signs include: Hole, split, or cleft in the iris of the eye ( coloboma ), Separation between the left and right side of the abdominal muscle ( diastasis recti ),  Umbilical hernia  or  inguinal hernia ,  There are often signs of  congenital heart disease , such as: Atrial septal defect  (ASD),  Patent ductus arteriosus  (PDA),  Ventricular septal defect  (VSD) ,  Tests may also show kidney problems, including: Horseshoe kidney,  Hydronephrosis ,  Polycystic kidney , </Answer>
