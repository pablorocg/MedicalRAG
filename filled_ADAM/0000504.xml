			<Question qid="0000504-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Bonding with your newborn</Question>
			<Answer>Bonding happens when you and your baby begin to feel a strong attachment with each other. You may feel great love and joy when you look at your baby. You may feel very protective of your baby. It is this first relationship with you that teaches babies to feel secure and good about themselves with other people. They learn to trust you because they know you are paying attention to them and taking care of them. Babies that have strong bonds with their parents are more likely to trust others and have good relationships as adults.</Answer>
