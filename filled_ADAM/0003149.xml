			<Question qid="0003149-2" qtype="considerations">What to do for Polydactyly ?</Question>
			<Answer>Having extra fingers or toes (6 or more) can occur on its own. There may not be any other symptoms or disease present. Polydactyly may be passed down in families. This trait involves only one&#160;gene that can cause several variations. African Americans, more than other ethnic groups, can inherit a 6th finger. In most cases, this is not caused by a genetic disease. Polydactyly can also occur with some genetic diseases. Extra digits may be poorly developed and attached by a small stalk. This most often occurs on the little finger side of the hand. Poorly formed digits are usually removed. Simply tying a tight string around the stalk can cause it to fall off in time if there are no bones in the digit. In some cases, the extra digits may be well-formed and can even function.  Larger digits may need surgery to be removed. </Answer>
