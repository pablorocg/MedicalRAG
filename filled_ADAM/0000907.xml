			<Question qid="0000907-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Cologne poisoning</Question>
			<Answer>Cologne is a scented liquid made from alcohol and essential oils. Cologne poisoning occurs when someone swallows cologne. This can be by accident or on purpose. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
