			<Question qid="0002702-3" qtype="causes">What causes Muscle atrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>There are three types of muscle atrophy: physiologic, pathologic, and neurogenic. Physiologic atrophy is caused by  not using the muscles enough . This type of atrophy can often be reversed with exercise and better nutrition. People who are most affected are those who: Have seated jobs, health problems that limit movement, or decreased activity levels, Are bedridden, Cannot move their limbs because of stroke or other brain disease, Are in a place that lacks gravity, such as during space flights ,  Pathologic atrophy is seen with aging, starvation, and diseases such as Cushing disease (because of taking too much medicines called corticosteroids). Neurogenic atrophy is the most severe type of muscle atrophy. It can be from an injury to, or disease of a nerve that connects to the muscle. This type of muscle atrophy tends to occur more suddenly than physiologic atrophy. Examples of diseases affecting the nerves that control muscles: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  (ALS, or Lou Gehrig disease), Damage to a single nerve, such as carpal tunnel syndrome,  Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome , Nerve damage caused by injury, diabetes, toxins, or alcohol, Polio ( poliomyelitis ), Spinal cord injury ,  Although people can adapt to muscle atrophy, even minor muscle atrophy causes some loss of movement or strength. Other causes of muscle atrophy may include: Burns , Long-term corticosteroid therapy,  Malnutrition ,  Muscular dystrophy  and other diseases of the muscle,  Osteoarthritis ,  Rheumatoid arthritis , </Answer>
