			<Question qid="0000490-8" qtype="considerations">What to do for Blood pressure measurement ?</Question>
			<Answer>It is normal for your blood pressure to vary at different times of the day: It is usually higher when you are at work., It drops slightly when you are at home., It is usually lowest when you are sleeping., It is normal for your blood pressure to increase suddenly when you wake up. In people with very high blood pressure, this is when they are most at risk for a heart attack and stroke.,  Blood pressure readings taken at home are usually a better measure of your current blood pressure than those taken at your provider's office. Make sure your home blood pressure monitor is accurate., Ask your provider to compare your home readings with those taken in the office.,  Many people get nervous at their provider's office and have higher readings than they have at home. This is called white coat hypertension. Home blood pressure readings can help detect this problem.</Answer>
