			<Question qid="0002435-2" qtype="causes">What causes Low blood pressure ?</Question>
			<Answer>Blood pressure varies from one person to another. A drop of as little as 20 mmHg can cause problems for some people. There are different types and causes of low blood pressure. Severe hypotension (shock) can be caused by sudden loss of blood ( shock ), severe infection,  heart attack , or severe allergic reaction ( anaphylaxis ). Orthostatic hypotension means your blood pressure drops when you shift from lying down to standing. This type of low blood pressure usually lasts only a few seconds or minutes. If this type of low blood pressure occurs after eating, it is called postprandial orthostatic hypotension. This type most often affects older adults, those with high blood pressure, and people with  Parkinson disease . Neurally mediated hypotension (NMH) most often affects young adults and children. It can occur when a person has been standing for a long time. Children usually outgrow this type of hypotension. Certain medicines and substances can lead to low blood pressure, including: Alcohol, Anti-anxiety medicines, Certain antidepressants, Diuretics, Heart medicines, including those used to treat  high blood pressure  and  coronary heart disease , Medicines used for surgery, Painkillers ,  Other causes of low blood pressure include: Nerve damage from diabetes &#160;or other disorders, Changes in heart rhythm ( arrhythmias ), Not drinking enough fluids ( dehydration ),  Heart failure , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002435-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Low blood pressure ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lower than normal blood pressure in a healthy person that does not cause any symptoms often does not need treatment. Otherwise, treatment depends on the cause of your low blood pressure and your symptoms. When you have symptoms from low blood pressure, sit or lie down right away. Then raise your feet above heart level. Severe hypotension caused by shock is a medical emergency. You may be given: Blood or other fluids through a needle (IV), Medicines to increase blood pressure and improve heart strength, Other medicines, such as antibiotics ,  Treatments for low blood pressure after standing up too quickly include: If medicines are the cause, your provider may change the dosage or switch you to a different medicine. Do not stop taking any medicines before talking to your provider., Your provider may suggest drinking more fluids to treat dehydration., Wearing  compression stockings  can help keep blood from collecting in the legs. This keeps more blood in the upper body. ,  People with NMH should avoid triggers, such as standing for a long period of time. Other treatments include drinking fluids and increasing salt in your diet. Talk to your provider before trying these measures. In severe cases, medicines may be prescribed.</Answer>
