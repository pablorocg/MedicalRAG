			<Question qid="0000086-2" qtype="causes">What causes Addison disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>The adrenal glands are small hormone-releasing organs located on top of each kidney. They are made up of an outer portion, called the cortex, and an inner portion, called the medulla. The cortex produces 3 hormones: Glucocorticoid hormones (such as cortisol) maintain sugar (glucose) control, blood pressure, decrease (suppress)  immune response , and help the body respond to stress., Mineralocorticoid hormones (such as aldosterone) regulate sodium, water and potassium balance., Sex hormones, androgens (male) and estrogens (female), affect sexual development and sex drive. ,  Addison disease results from damage to the adrenal cortex. The damage causes the cortex to produce hormone levels that are too low. This damage may be caused by the following: The immune system mistakenly attacking the adrenal glands ( autoimmune disease ), Infections such as  tuberculosis ,  HIV , or fungal infections, Hemorrhage into the adrenal glands, Tumors ,  Risk factors for the autoimmune type of Addison disease include other autoimmune diseases: Swelling (inflammation) of the thyroid gland that often results in reduced thyroid function ( chronic thyroiditis )
  , Thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone ( overactive thyroid ,  Graves disease )
  , Itchy rash with bumps and blisters ( dermatitis herpetiformis )
  , Parathyroid glands in the neck do not produce enough parathyroid hormone ( hypoparathyroidism )
  , Pituitary gland does not produce normal amounts of some or all of its hormones ( hypopituitarism )
  , Autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves and the muscles they control ( myasthenia gravis )
  , Body does not have enough healthy red blood cells ( pernicious anemia )
  , Testicles cannot produce sperm or male hormones ( testicular failure ),  Type I diabetes , Loss of brown color (pigment) from areas of the skin ( vitiligo )
  ,  Certain rare genetic defects may also cause adrenal insufficiency.</Answer>

			<Answer>Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.  Blood tests will likely be ordered and may show: Increased  potassium , Low  cortisol level , Low  sodium level , Low pH, Normal testosterone and estrogen levels, but low DHEA level, High  eosinophil count ,  Additional laboratory tests may be ordered. Other tests may include: Abdominal x-ray ,  Abdominal CT scan , Cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test

			<Question qid="0000086-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Addison disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment with replacement corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids will control the symptoms of this disease. These medicines usually need to be taken for life.  Never skip doses of your medicine for this condition because life-threatening reactions may occur. Your provider may tell you to increase your dosage for a short time because of: Infection, Injury, Stress, Surgery ,  During an extreme form of adrenal insufficiency, called  adrenal crisis , you must inject hydrocortisone right away. Treatment for low blood pressure is usually needed as well. Some people with Addison disease (or family members) are taught to give themselves an emergency injection of hydrocortisone during stressful situations. Always carry medical ID (card, bracelet, or necklace) that says you have adrenal insufficiency. The ID should also say the type of medicine and dosage you need in case of an emergency. </Answer>
