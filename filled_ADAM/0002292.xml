			<Question qid="0002292-2" qtype="causes">What causes Klinefelter syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Most people have 46 chromosomes. Chromosomes contain all of your genes and DNA, the building blocks of the body. The 2 sex chromosomes (X and Y) determine the genetic sex of a child.&#160;The genetic sex of a child is determined at conception. The mother's egg cell contains an X chromosome, while the father's sperm cell contains either an X or a Y chromosome. Normally, an infant inherits 1 pair of sex chromosomes, 1 X from the mother and 1 X or 1 Y from the father. A baby who inherits the X chromosome from the father is a genetic female and has 2 X chromosomes. A baby who inherits the Y chromosome from the father is a genetic male and has 1 X and 1 Y  chromosome .&#160; Klinefelter syndrome results when a male child is born with at least 1 extra X chromosome. They have 47 chromosomes instead of 46. This is written as 47, XXY. Klinefelter syndrome occurs as a random event. There is no exact cause, and the condition is not inherited.&#160; Klinefelter syndrome occurs in about 1 out of 500 to 1,000 male infants. Women who get pregnant after age 35 are slightly more likely to have a male child with this syndrome than younger women.</Answer>
