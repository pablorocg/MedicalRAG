			<Question qid="0002392-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Lifting and bending the right way</Question>
			<Answer>Many people  injure their backs  when they lift objects the wrong way. When you reach your 30's, you are more likely to hurt your back when you bend to lift something up or put it down. This may be because you have injured the muscles, ligaments, or disks in your spine in the past. Also, as we get older our muscles and ligaments become less flexible. And, the disks that act as cushions between the bones of our spine become more brittle as we age. All of these things make us more prone to having a back injury.</Answer>
