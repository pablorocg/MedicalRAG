			<Answer>Ringworm is common, especially among children. But, it can affect people of all ages. It is caused by a fungus, not a worm like the name suggests. Many bacteria, fungi, and yeast live on your body. Some of these are useful, while others can cause infections. Ringworm occurs when a type of fungus grows and multiplies on your skin. Ringworm can spread from one person to another.

You can also catch ringworm from pets. Cats are common carriers. The fungus that causes ringworm thrives in warm, moist areas. Ringworm is more likely when you are often wet (such as from sweating) and from minor injuries to your skin, scalp, or nails. Ringworm can affect the skin on your: Beard,  tinea barbae , Body,  tinea corporis , Feet,  tinea pedis  (also called athlete's foot), Groin area,  tinea cruris  (also called jock itch), Scalp,  tinea capitis , </Answer>
