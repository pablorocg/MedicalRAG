			<Question qid="0003434-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Rotator cuff exercises</Question>
			<Answer>The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that form a cuff over the shoulder joint. These muscles and tendons hold the arm in its joint and help the shoulder joint to move in a coordinated and pain-free way. The tendons can be torn from overuse, injury, or wearing away over time. Exercises can help strengthen the rotator cuff muscles and tendons to relieve your symptoms.</Answer>
