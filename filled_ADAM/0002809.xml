			<Answer>Sometimes discharge from your nipples is OK and will get better on its own. You are more likely to have nipple discharge if you have been pregnant at least once. Nipple discharge is most often not due to cancer (thus a benign condition), but rarely, it can be a sign of breast cancer. It is important to find out what is causing it and to get treatment. Here are some reasons for nipple discharge: Pregnancy, Recent breastfeeding, Rubbing on the area from a bra or t-shirt, Injury to the breast, Breast infection, Inflammation and clogging of the breast ducts, Noncancerous pituitary tumors, Small growth in the breast that is usually not cancer, Severe underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism),  Fibrocystic breast  (normal lumpiness in the breast), Use of certain medicines such as birth control pills or antidepressants, Use of certain herbs, such as anise, blessed thistle, and fennel, Widening of the milk ducts ,  Intraductal papilloma  (benign tumor in the milk duct), Chronic kidney disease, Illicit drug use, including cocaine, opioids and marijuana,  Sometimes, babies can have nipple discharge. This is caused by hormones from the mother before birth. It should go away in 2 weeks.
