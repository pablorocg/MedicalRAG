			<Question qid="0003773-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Substance use - LSD ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment begins with recognizing there is a problem. Once you decide you want to do something about your LSD use, the next step is getting help and support. Treatment programs use behavior change techniques through counseling (talk therapy). The goal is to help you understand your behaviors and why you use LSD. Involving family and friends during counseling can help support you and keep you from going back to using (relapsing). Because LSD use may cause mental problems, medicines may be also prescribed to help treat symptoms of  anxiety ,  depression , or  psychosis . </Answer>
