			<Answer>Having a child with cancer is one of the hardest things you will ever deal with as a parent.

You and your partner are used to managing your family life on your own, but cancer adds an extra burden. Learn how to get help and support so you can cope more easily. That way you will have more time and energy to be there for your child.</Answer>
