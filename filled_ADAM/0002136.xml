			<Question qid="0002136-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Ileostomy - what to ask your doctor</Question>
			<Answer>You have had an operation to create an  ileostomy  or colostomy. Your ileostomy or colostomy changes the way your body gets rid of waste (stool, feces, or "poop"). You now have an opening in your belly called a stoma. Waste will pass through the stoma into a pouch that collects it. You will need to take care of your stoma and empty the pouch. Below are some questions you may want to ask your health care provider to help you take care of your ileostomy or colostomy.</Answer>
