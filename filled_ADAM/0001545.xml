			<Question qid="0001545-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Familial Mediterranean fever ?</Question>
			<Answer>Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a rare disorder passed down through families (inherited). It involves repeated fevers and inflammation that often affects the lining of the abdomen, chest, or joints.</Answer>

	<QAPair pid="2">
			<Question qid="0001545-2" qtype="causes">What causes Familial Mediterranean fever ?</Question>
			<Answer>FMF is most often caused by a mutation in a gene named  MEFV . This gene creates a protein involved in controlling inflammation. The disease appears only in people who received two copies of the altered gene, one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance or an autosomal recessive condition. FMF most often affects people of Mediterranean ancestry. These include non-Ashkenazi (Sephardic) Jews, Armenians, and Arabs. People from other ethnic groups can also be affected.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001545-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Familial Mediterranean fever ?</Question>
			<Answer>If genetic testing shows that you have the  MEFV  gene mutation and your symptoms match the typical pattern, the diagnosis is nearly certain. Laboratory tests and  x-rays  or other imaging tests are used to rule out other possible diseases to help confirm the diagnosis. Levels of certain blood tests may be higher than normal when done during an attack. Tests may include: Complete blood count  (CBC) that includes white blood cell count,  C-reactive protein &#160;(CRP) to check for inflammation,  Erythrocyte sedimentation rate  (ESR) to check for inflammation,  Fibrinogen test  to check blood clotting, </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001545-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Familial Mediterranean fever ?</Question>
			<Answer>The goal of treatment for FMF is to control symptoms. Colchicine, a medicine that reduces inflammation, may help during an attack and may prevent further attacks. It can also help prevent a serious complication called systemic  amyloidosis , which is common in people with FMF.  NSAIDs may be used to treat fever and pain.</Answer>
