			<Question qid="0004089-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Understanding your health care costs ?</Question>
			<Answer>All health insurance plans include out-of-pocket costs. These are costs that you have to pay for your care, such as copayments and deductibles. The insurance company pays the rest. You may need to pay some out-of-pocket costs at the time of your visit. Others may be billed to you after your visit.  Out-of-pocket costs allow health plans to share medical costs with you. They can also help guide you to make good decisions about where and when to get care. When you choose a health plan, you need to understand what your out-of-pocket costs may be. This way, you can plan ahead for what you may need to spend during the year. You also might be able to look for ways to save money on out-of-pocket costs.</Answer>
