			<Question qid="0002747-2" qtype="considerations">What to do for Natal teeth ?</Question>
			<Answer>Natal teeth are uncommon. They most often develop on the lower gum, where the central incisor teeth will appear. They have little root structure. They are attached to the end of the gum by soft tissue and are often wobbly. Natal teeth are usually not well-formed, but they may cause irritation and injury to the infant's tongue when nursing. Natal teeth may also be uncomfortable for a nursing mother. Natal teeth are often removed shortly after birth while the  newborn infant  is still in the hospital. This is done very often if the tooth is loose and the child runs a risk of "breathing in" the tooth.</Answer>
