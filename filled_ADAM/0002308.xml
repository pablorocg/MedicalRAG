			<Question qid="0002308-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Kwashiorkor ?</Question>
			<Answer>People who start early treatment can recover fully. The goal is to get more calories and protein into their diet. Children with the disease cannot reach their complete height and growth. Calories are given first in the form of  carbohydrates ,  simple sugars , and fats. Proteins are started after other sources of calories have already provided energy. Vitamin and mineral supplements will be given. Food must be restarted slowly since the person has been without much food for a long period of time. Suddenly eating high-calorie foods can cause problems. Many malnourished children will develop intolerance to milk sugar ( lactose intolerance ). They will need to be given supplements with the  enzyme  lactase so that they can tolerate milk products. People who are in shock need treatment right away to restore blood volume and maintain blood pressure.</Answer>
