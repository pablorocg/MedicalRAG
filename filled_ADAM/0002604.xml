			<Question qid="0002604-2" qtype="causes">What causes Mesothelioma - malignant ?</Question>
			<Answer>Long-term exposure to asbestos is the biggest risk factor. Asbestos is a fire-resistant material. It was once commonly found in insulation, ceiling and roofing vinyls, cement, and car brakes. Even though many asbestos workers smoked, experts do not believe smoking itself is a cause of this condition. Older veterans make up 30% of the cases of mesothelioma due to exposure in the military ship, vehicle, and plane industry. Men are affected more often than women. The average age at diagnosis is 60 years. Most people seem to develop the condition about 30 years after being in contact with the asbestos.</Answer>
