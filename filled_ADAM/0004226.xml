			<Question qid="0004226-2" qtype="causes">What causes VIPoma ?</Question>
			<Answer>VIPoma causes cells in the pancreas to produce a high level of a hormone called vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). This hormone increases secretions from the intestines. It also relaxes some of the smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal system. The exact cause of VIPomas is not known. VIPomas are often diagnosed in adults, most commonly around age 50. Women are more likely to be affected than men. This cancer is rare. Each year, only about 1 in 1 million people are diagnosed with a VIPoma.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004226-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for VIPoma ?</Question>
			<Answer>The first goal of treatment is to correct dehydration. Fluids are often given through a vein (intravenous fluids) to replace fluids lost through diarrhea. The next goal is to slow the diarrhea. Medicines can help control diarrhea. One such medicine is octreotide. It is a manmade form of a natural hormone that blocks the action of VIP. The best chance of a cure is surgery to remove the tumor. If the tumor has not spread to other organs, surgery can often cure the condition.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004226-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for VIPoma ?</Question>
			<Answer>Surgery can usually cure VIPomas. But, in one third to one half of people, the tumor has spread by the time of diagnosis and cannot be cured. However, it grows fairly slowly, and its effects can be often controlled by octreotide.</Answer>
