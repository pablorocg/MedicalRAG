			<Question qid="0003419-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Riboflavin</Question>
			<Answer>Riboflavin is a type of B vitamin. It is water soluble, which means it is not stored in the body. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. The body keeps a small reserve of these vitamins. They have to be taken on a regular basis to maintain the reserve.</Answer>
