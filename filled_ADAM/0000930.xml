			<Question qid="0000930-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Complement component 4</Question>
			<Answer>Complement component 4 is a blood test that measures the activity of a certain protein. This protein is part of the complement system. The complement system is a group of nearly 60 proteins that are found in the blood plasma or on the surface of some cells. The proteins work with your immune system and play a role in protecting from infection. They also help to remove dead cells and foreign material from the body. Rarely, people may inherit deficiency of some complement proteins. These people are prone to certain infections or autoimmune disorders. There are nine major complement proteins. They are labeled C1 through C9. This article describes the test that measures C4.</Answer>
