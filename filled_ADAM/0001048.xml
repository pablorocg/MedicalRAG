			<Answer>C neoformans  and  C gattii  are the fungi that cause this disease. Infection with  C neoformans  is seen worldwide. Infection with  C gattii  has mainly been seen in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, British Columbia in Canada, Southeast Asia, and Australia. In the United States, sporadic cases have been seen in many states including Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Hawaii, Georgia, Rhode Island, and Florida. Cryptococcus is the most common fungus that causes serious infection worldwide. Both types of fungi are found in soil. If you breathe the fungus in, it infects your lungs. The infection may go away on its own, remain in the lungs only, or spread throughout the body (disseminate).  C neoformans  infection is most often seen in people with a weak immune system, such as those who: Are infected with  HIV/AIDS , Take corticosteroid medicines, Cancer, Are on chemotherapy medicines for cancer, Have  Hodgkin disease , Have had an organ transplant,  C gattii  may affect people with normal immune system.
