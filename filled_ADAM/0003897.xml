			<Answer>Your child is scheduled to have surgery. Learn about what to expect on the day of surgery so that you will be prepared. If your child is old enough to understand, you can help them prepare as well. The surgeon's office will let you know what time you should arrive on the day of surgery. This may be early in the morning. If your child is having minor surgery, your child will go home afterward on the same day., If your child is having major surgery, your child will stay in the hospital after the surgery., </Answer>
