			<Question qid="0004312-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about White matter of the brain</Question>
			<Answer>White matter is found in the deeper tissues of the brain (subcortical). It contains nerve fibers (axons), which are extensions of nerve cells (neurons). Many of these nerve fibers are surrounded by a type of sheath or covering called myelin. Myelin gives the white matter its color. It also protects the nerve fibers from injury. It improves the speed and transmission of electrical nerve signals along extensions of the nerve cells called axons. By comparison, gray matter is tissue found on the surface of the brain (cortical). It contains the cell bodies of neurons, which give gray matter its color. </Answer>
