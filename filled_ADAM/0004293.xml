			<Answer>The arrival of your new son or daughter is a time of excitement and joy. It is often also a hectic time, so it can be hard to remember to pack everything that you will need at the hospital. About a month before your baby's due date, make sure you have the items below. Pack as many beforehand as you can. Use this checklist as a guide to get organized for the big event.</Answer>
