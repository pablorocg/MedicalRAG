			<Question qid="0003585-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Simple, heart-smart substitutions ?</Question>
			<Answer>A  heart-healthy diet  is low in  saturated fat . Saturated fat can increase your bad cholesterol and clog your arteries. A heart-healthy diet also limits foods with added salt, which can increase your blood pressure, and added sugar, which can lead to weight gain. Making heart-healthy food choices does not mean you have to sacrifice flavor. The key is to include more fresh produce, whole grains, beans, lean meats, fish, and low-fat dairy.</Answer>
