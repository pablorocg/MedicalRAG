			<Question qid="0001895-2" qtype="causes">What causes HELLP syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>The cause of HELLP syndrome has not been found.&#160;It is considered to be a variant of preeclampsia. Sometimes the presence of HELLP syndrome is due to an underlying disease, such as  antiphospholipid syndrome . HELLP syndrome occurs in about 1 to 2 out of 1,000 pregnancies. In women with  preeclampsia  or  eclampsia , the condition develops in 10% to 20% of pregnancies. Risk factors for HELLP syndrome include: Age greater than 35, Obesity, History of preeclampsia, History of diabetes or renal disease, History of multiple births, History of high blood pressure&#160;,  Most often, HELLP develops during the third trimester of pregnancy (between 26 to 40 weeks gestation). Sometimes it develops in the week after the baby is born. Many women have high blood pressure and are diagnosed with preeclampsia before they develop HELLP syndrome. In some cases, HELLP symptoms are the first warning of preeclampsia. The condition is sometimes misdiagnosed as: Flu or other viral illness, Gallbladder disease,  Hepatitis ,  Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura  (ITP), Lupus flare,  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura , </Answer>
