			<Question qid="0002506-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Malathion poisoning ?</Question>
			<Answer>Malathion is an insecticide, a product used to kill or control bugs. Poisoning may occur if you swallow malathion, handle it without gloves, or do not wash your hands soon after touching it. Large amounts can be absorbed through the skin. This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual poison exposure. If you have an exposure, you should call your local emergency number (such as 911) or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>

			<Answer>People who continue to improve in the first 4 to 6 hours after receiving medical treatment usually recover. Prolonged treatment often is needed to reverse the poisoning. This may include staying in the hospital intensive care unit and getting long-term therapy. Some effects of the poison may last for weeks or months, or even longer. Keep all chemicals, cleaners, and industrial products in their original containers and marked as poison, and out of the reach of children.
