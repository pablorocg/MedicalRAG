Water is best., Drink at least 1 cup (240 milliliters) of liquid every time you have a loose bowel movement., Eat small meals throughout the day instead of 3 big meals., Eat some salty foods, such as pretzels, soup, and sports drinks., Eat some high-potassium foods, such as bananas, potatoes without the skin, and watered-down fruit juices.,  If your child has Salmonella, it is important to keep them from getting dehydrated.&#160;At first, try 1 ounce (2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters) of fluid every 30 to 60 minutes. Infants should continue to breastfeed and receive  electrolyte  replacement solutions as recommended by your child's provider., You can use an over-the-counter drink, such as Pedialyte or Infalyte. Do not water down these drinks., You can also try Pedialyte&#160;freezer pops., Watered-down fruit juice or broth may also help.,  Medicines that slow diarrhea are often not given because they may make the infection last longer. If you have severe symptoms, your provider may prescribe antibiotics if you: Have diarrhea more than 9 or 10 times per day, Have a high fever, Need to be in the hospital,  If you take water pills or diuretics, you may need to stop taking them when you have diarrhea.
