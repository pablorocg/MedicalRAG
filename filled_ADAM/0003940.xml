			<Question qid="0003940-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Tick removal</Question>
			<Answer>Ticks are small, insect-like creatures that live in woods and fields. They attach to you as you brush past bushes, plants, and grass. Once on you, ticks often move to a warm, moist location. They are often found in the armpits, groin, and hair. Ticks attach firmly to your skin and begin to draw blood for their meal. This process is painless. Most people will not notice the  tick bite . Some species of ticks can be as large as a pencil eraser. They can also be so small that they are very hard to see. They grow in size (engorgement) after attachment. Ticks can transmit bacteria that can cause disease. Some of these can be serious.</Answer>
