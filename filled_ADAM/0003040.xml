			<Question qid="0003040-2" qtype="causes">What causes Peritonitis - secondary ?</Question>
			<Answer>Secondary peritonitis has several major causes. Bacteria may enter the peritoneum through a hole (perforation) in an organ of the digestive tract. The hole may be caused by a ruptured appendix, stomach ulcer, or perforated colon. It may also come from an injury, such as a gunshot or knife wound or following the ingestion of a sharp foreign body.,  Bile  or chemicals released by the pancreas may leak into the abdominal cavity. This may be caused by  swelling and inflammation of the pancreas  called pancreatitis., Tubes or catheters placed into the abdomen may cause this problem. These include catheters for peritoneal dialysis, feeding tubes, and others.,  An infection of the bloodstream (sepsis) may lead to an infection in the abdomen also. This is a severe illness. This tissue may become infected when there is no clear cause. Necrotizing enterocolitis  occurs when the lining of the intestinal wall dies and can lead to peritonitis. This problem nearly always develops in an infant who is ill or born early.</Answer>
