			<Question qid="0001248-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Triamcinolone Topical and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Triamcinolone topical is used to treat the itching, redness, dryness, crusting, scaling, inflammation, and discomfort of various skin conditions, including psoriasis (a skin disease in which red, scaly patches form on some areas of the body and eczema (a skin disease that causes the skin to be dry and itchy and to sometimes develop red, scaly rashes).

			<Question qid="0001248-2" qtype="usage">How should Triamcinolone Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Triamcinolone comes in ointment, cream, lotion, and aerosol (spray) in various strengths for use on the skin and as a paste for use in the mouth. It usually is applied two to four times a day. For mouth sores, it is applied at bedtime and, if necessary, two or three times daily, preferably after meals. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use triamcinolone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply it to other areas of your body or use it to treat other skin conditions unless directed to do so by your doctor. To use triamcinolone topical, apply the ointment, cream, or lotion sparingly in a thin film and rub it in gently. To use the lotion or aerosol (spray) on your scalp, part your hair, apply a small amount of the medicine on the affected area, and rub it in gently. Protect the area from washing and rubbing until the lotion or spray dries. You may wash your hair as usual but not right after applying the medicine. To apply an aerosol, shake well and spray on the affected area holding the container about 3 to 6 inches away. Spray for about 2 seconds to cover an area the size of your hand. Take care not to inhale the vapors. If you are spraying near your face, cover your eyes. To apply the paste, press a small amount on the mouth sore without rubbing until a thin film develops. You may need to use more paste if the mouth sore is large. If the mouth sore does not begin to heal within 7 days, call your doctor. Triamcinolone aerosol (spray) may catch fire. Stay away from open fire, flames, and do not smoke while you are applying triamcinolone aerosol, and for a short time afterward. If you are using triamcinolone topical on your face, keep it out of your eyes. Do not apply other skin preparations or products on the treated area without talking with your doctor. If you are using triamcinolone on a child's diaper area, do not use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants. Such use may increase side effects.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001248-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Triamcinolone Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze it. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
