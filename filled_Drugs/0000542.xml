			<Question qid="0000542-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Galantamine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Galantamine is used to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD; a brain disease that slowly destroys the memory and the ability to think, learn, communicate and handle daily activities). Galantamine is in a class of medications called acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. It works by increasing the amount of a certain natural substance in the brain that is needed for memory and thought. Galantamine may improve the ability to think and remember or slow the loss of these abilities in people who have AD. However, galantamine will not cure AD or prevent the loss of mental abilities at some time in the future.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000542-2" qtype="usage">How should Galantamine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Galantamine comes as a tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) capsule, and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. The tablets and liquid are usually taken twice a day, preferably with the morning and evening meals. The extended-release capsules are usually taken once a day in the morning. Take galantamine at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take galantamine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You are less likely to experience side effects of galantamine if you follow the exact dosing schedule prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the extended-release capsules whole; do not crush or chew them. Galantamine may upset your stomach, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Take galantamine with food and drink 6 to 8 glasses of water every day. This may decrease the chance that you will have an upset stomach during your treatment. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of galantamine and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 4 weeks. Continue to take galantamine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking galantamine without talking to your doctor. If you do stop taking galantamine for a few days or longer, call your doctor before you start to take galantamine again. Your doctor will probably tell you to start with the lowest dose of galantamine and gradually increase your dose to the dose you had been taking. Before you take galantamine oral solution for the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to take the oral solution. To take the oral solution, follow these steps:
 Open the child-proof cap by pushing the cap down while turning it to the left. Remove the cap., Pull the pipette (the tube that you use to measure the dose of galantamine) out of its case., Place the pipette fully into the bottle of galantamine., While holding the bottom ring of the pipette, pull the pipette plunger up to the marking that shows the dose your doctor prescribed., Hold the bottom ring of the pipette and remove the pipette from the bottle. Be careful not to push the plunger in., Prepare 3 to 4 ounces (about 1/2 cup [90 to 120 milliliters]) of any non-alcoholic beverage. Empty all the medicine from the pipette into the beverage by pushing the plunger all the way in., Stir the beverage well., Drink all of the mixture right away., Put the plastic cap back on the bottle of galantamine and turn the cap to the right to close the bottle., Rinse the empty pipette by putting its open end into a glass of water, pulling the plunger out, and pushing the plunger in to remove the water., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000542-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Galantamine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
