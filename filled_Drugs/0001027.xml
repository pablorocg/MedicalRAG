			<Question qid="0001027-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Propafenone ?</Question>
			<Answer>In clinical studies, people who had recently had a heart attack and took certain medications for irregular heartbeat that are similar to propafenone were more likely to die than people who did not take one of the medications. Propafenone may also cause life-threatening irregular heartbeat and increase the risk of death in certain patients. Tell your doctor if you have had a heart attack within the past two years or if you have heart disease. Because of the risks of taking propafenone, it should be used only to treat life-threatening irregular heartbeat. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking propafenone. Your doctor may examine you and may order certain lab tests and electrocardiogram (EKG) tests to check your body's response to propafenone. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001027-3" qtype="usage">How should Propafenone be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Propafenone comes as a tablet and an extended-release (long-acting) capsule to take by mouth. The tablet is usually taken three times a day, once every 8 hours. The extended-release capsule is usually taken two times a day, once every 12 hours, with or without food. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take propafenone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the capsules whole; do not crush or open the capsules or divide the contents of a capsule into more than one dose. You may begin taking propafenone in a hospital so that your doctor can monitor you carefully as your body gets used to the medication. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of propafenone and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 5 days. Propafenone may control your irregular heartbeat, but will not cure it. Continue to take propafenone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking propafenone without talking to your doctor. Your heartbeat may become irregular if you suddenly stop taking propafenone.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001027-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Propafenone ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program.

See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
