			<Answer>Interferon beta-1a subcutaneous injection is used to treat adults with various forms of multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and people may experience weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination, and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control) including: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS; nerve symptom episodes that last at least 24 hours),, relapsing-remitting forms (course of disease where symptoms flare up from time to time), or, secondary progressive forms (course of disease where relapses occur more often).,  Interferon beta-1a is in a class of medications called immunomodulators.

			<Question qid="0000632-2" qtype="usage">How should Interferon beta-1a Subcutaneous Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Interferon beta-1a subcutaneous injection comes as a solution (liquid) in a prefilled syringe or a prefilled automatic injection device to inject subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually injected three times a week. You should inject this medication on the same 3 days every week, for example, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The injections should be spaced at least 48 hours apart, so it is best to inject your medication around the same time of day on each of your injection days. The best time to inject this medication is in the late afternoon or evening. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use interferon beta-1a exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of interferon beta-1a and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 2 weeks. Interferon beta-1a controls symptoms of MS but does not cure it. Continue to use interferon beta-1a even if you feel well. Do not stop using interferon beta-1a without talking to your doctor. You will receive your first dose of interferon beta-1a subcutaneous in your doctor's office. After that, you can inject interferon beta-1a subcutaneous yourself or have a friend or relative perform the injections. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it. Before you use interferon beta-1a subcutaneous for the first time, your or the person who will be giving the injections should also read the manufacturer's information for the patient that comes with it. Follow the directions carefully. Use a new prefilled syringe or prefilled automatic injection device each time you inject your medication. Do not reuse or share syringes or automatic injection devices. Even if there is still some solution left in the syringe or device after you inject, do not inject again. Discard used syringes or automatic injection devices in a puncture resistant container that is out of the reach of children. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to discard the puncture-resistant container. Always look at the medication in your prefilled syringe or automatic injection device before you use it. It should be a clear to slightly yellow solution. If the solution is cloudy, discolored, or contains particles or if the expiration date marked on the syringe or automatic injection device has passed, do not use that syringe or device. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about where on your body you should inject interferon beta-1a subcutaneous. You can inject interferon beta-1a in areas of your body with a layer of fat between the skin and muscle, such as your thigh, the outer surface of your upper arms, your stomach, or your buttocks. If you are very thin, only inject in your thigh or the outer surface of your arm for injection. Choose a different spot each time you inject your medication. Keep a record of the date and spot of each injection. Do not use the same spot two times in a row. Do not inject near your navel (belly button) or waistline or into an area where the skin is sore, red, bruised, scarred, infected, or abnormal in any way. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with interferon beta-1a subcutaneous injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000632-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Interferon beta-1a Subcutaneous Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it in the refrigerator, but do not freeze it. If a refrigerator is not available, you can store the medication at room temperature away from heat and light for up to 30 days. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
