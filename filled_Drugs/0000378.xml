			<Question qid="0000378-2" qtype="usage">How should Diphenoxylate be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Diphenoxylate comes as a tablet and solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken as needed up to 4 times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take diphenoxylate exactly as directed. Do not take more of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. The oral solution comes in a container with a special dropper for measuring the dose. Ask your pharmacist if you have questions about how to measure a dose. Your diarrhea symptoms should improve within 48 hours of treatment with diphenoxylate. Your doctor may tell you to decrease your dose as your symptoms improve. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse within 10 days of treatment, call your doctor and stop taking diphenoxylate. Diphenoxylate can be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or for a longer period of time than your doctor tells you to. Atropine has been added to diphenoxylate tablets to cause unpleasant effects if this medication is taken in higher doses than recommended.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000378-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Diphenoxylate ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom) and light. Discard  any remaining solution 90 days after opening the bottle. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
