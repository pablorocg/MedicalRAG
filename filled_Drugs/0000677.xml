			<Question qid="0000677-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Lansoprazole, Clarithromycin, and Amoxicillin and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin are used to treat and prevent the return of ulcers (sores in the lining of the stomach or intestine) caused by a certain type of bacteria ( H. pylori ). Lansoprazole is in a class of medications called proton pump inhibitors. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin are in a class of medications called antibiotics. Lansoprazole works by decreasing the amount of acid made in the stomach. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin work by stopping the growth of the bacteria that may cause ulcers. Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000677-2" qtype="usage">How should Lansoprazole, Clarithromycin, and Amoxicillin be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lansoprazole comes as a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent break-down of the medication by stomach acids) capsule, clarithromycin comes as a tablet, and amoxicillin comes as a capsule, all to be taken by mouth. These medications are usually taken before a meal twice a day. To help you take the right number of capsules and tablets at each dose, the medication is packaged in dosing cards. Each dosing card contains all of the medication needed for both daily doses. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take the medication exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets and capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Take lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking antibiotics too soon your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics. If your condition does not improve or gets worse, call your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000677-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Lansoprazole, Clarithromycin, and Amoxicillin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the daily packets and storage box it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light and excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
