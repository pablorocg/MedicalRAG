			<Question qid="0000696-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Levoleucovorin Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Levoleucovorin injection is used in adults and children to prevent harmful effects of methotrexate (Trexall) when methotrexate is used to treat osteosarcoma (cancer that forms in bones). Levoleucovorin injection is also used to treat adults and children who have accidentally received an overdose of methotrexate or similar medications or who are not able to eliminate these medications properly from their bodies. Levoleucovorin injection is also used with fluorouracil (5-FU, a chemotherapy medication) to treat adults with colorectal cancer (cancer that begins in the large intestine) that has spread to other parts of the body. Levoleucovorin injection is in a class of medications called folic acid analogs. It works to prevent the harmful effects of methotrexate by protecting healthy cells, while allowing methotrexate to enter and kill cancer cells. It works to treat colorectal cancer by increasing the effects of fluorouracil.</Answer>
