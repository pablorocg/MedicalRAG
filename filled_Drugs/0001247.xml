			<Question qid="0001247-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Triamcinolone Nasal Spray and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Triamcinolone nasal spray is used to relieve sneezing, runny, stuffy, or itchy nose and itchy, watery eyes caused by hay fever or other allergies. Triamcinolone nasal spray should not be used to treat symptoms (e.g., sneezing, stuffy, runny, or itchy nose) caused by the common cold. Triamcinolone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by blocking the release of certain natural substances that cause allergy symptoms.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001247-2" qtype="usage">How should Triamcinolone Nasal Spray be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Triamcinolone comes as a liquid (prescription and nonprescription) to spray in the nose. It is usually sprayed in each nostril once daily. If you are an adult, you will begin your treatment with a higher dose of triamcinolone nasal spray and then decrease your dose when your symptoms improve. If you are giving triamcinolone nasal spray to a child, treatment will begin with a lower dose of the medication and then the dose may increase if the child's symptoms do not improve. You will decrease the dose when the child's symptoms improve. Follow the directions on the package or product label carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. Use triamcinolone spray exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed on the package label or prescribed by your doctor. An adult should help children under 12 years old to use triamcinolone nasal spray. Children younger than 2 years of age should not use this medication. Triamcinolone nasal spray is only for use in the nose. Do not swallow the nasal spray and be careful not to spray it in your eyes. If you accidentally get triamcinolone nasal spray in your eyes, rinse your eyes well with water. Each bottle of triamcinolone nasal spray should only be used by one person. Do not share triamcinolone nasal spray because this may spread germs. Triamcinolone nasal spray controls the symptoms of hay fever and allergies but does not cure these conditions. Your symptoms may improve on the day that you begin using triamcinolone nasal spray, but it may take up to 1 week of daily use before you feel the full benefit of this medication. If you use the prescription triamcinolone nasal spray daily and your symptoms do not improve after 3 weeks, call your doctor. If you use the nonprescription triamcinolone nasal spray daily and your symptoms do not improve after 1 week, call your doctor. Triamcinolone nasal spray is designed to provide a certain number of sprays. After the marked number of sprays have been used, the remaining sprays in the bottle might not contain the correct amount of medication.

While you are sniffing, use your forefinger and middle finger to press firmly down on the applicator and release a spray., If you are using 2 sprays, repeat steps 6 to 8., Repeat steps 6 to 8 in the other nostril., Do not blow your nose for 15 minutes after using the spray., Wipe the applicator with a clean tissue and cover it with the cap., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001247-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Triamcinolone Nasal Spray ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
