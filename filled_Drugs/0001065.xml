			<Question qid="0001065-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Rifapentine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rifapentine is used with other medications to treat active tuberculosis (TB; a serious infection that affects the lungs and sometimes other parts of the body) in adults and children 12 years of age and older. Rifapentine is also used with isoniazid (Laniazid) to treat adults and children 2 years of age and older with latent (resting or nongrowing) TB, including those in close contact with people who have active TB, a positive tuberculin skin test, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or those with pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lungs with an unknown cause). Rifapentine is in a class of medications called antimycobacterials. It works by killing the bacteria that cause infection. Antibiotics such as rifapentine will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001065-2" qtype="usage">How should Rifapentine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rifapentine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. When rifapentine is used to treat active TB, it is usually taken with food twice weekly, with doses at least 3 days apart, for the first 2 months and then once weekly for 4 months. When rifapentine is used to treat latent TB infection, it should be with food taken once every week. Take rifapentine at around the same time every scheduled day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rifapentine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you are unable to swallow the tablets, you can crush them and mix the medication in a small amount of semisolid food such as pudding or applesauce. Swallow the mixture right away; do not store it for later use. Continue to take rifapentine until you finish the prescription even if you feel better, and be careful not to miss doses. If you stop taking rifapentine too soon, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics. If you miss doses of rifapentine, you may develop uncomfortable or serious symptoms when you begin to take the medication again.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001065-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Rifapentine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
