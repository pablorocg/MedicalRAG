			<Question qid="0000244-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Cholestyramine Resin and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cholestyramine is used with diet changes (restriction of cholesterol and fat intake) to reduce the amount of cholesterol and certain fatty substances in your blood. Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats may help to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000244-2" qtype="usage">How should Cholestyramine Resin be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cholestyramine comes in a chewable bar and in a powder that must be mixed with fluids or food. It usually is taken two to four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cholestyramine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Take this medication before a meal and/or at bedtime, and try to take any other medications at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after you take cholestyramine because cholestyramine can interfere with their absorption. Continue to take cholestyramine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking cholestyramine without talking to your doctor. This precaution is especially important if you also take other drugs; changing your cholestyramine dose may change their effects. Do not take the powder alone. To take the powder, follow these steps:
 Stir the powder into a glass of water, milk, heavy or pulpy fruit juices such as orange juice, or other beverage. If you use a carbonated beverage, mix the powder slowly in a large glass to avoid excessive foaming., Drink the mixture slowly., Rinse the drinking glass with more of the beverage and drink it to be sure that you get all of the powder.,  The powder also may be mixed with applesauce, crushed pineapple, pureed fruit, and soup. Although the powder may be mixed in hot foods, do not heat the powder. To improve the taste and for convenience, you can prepare doses for an entire day on the previous evening and refrigerate them. To take the chewable bars, chew each bite thoroughly before swallowing. Drink plenty of liquids while you are taking this medication.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000244-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Cholestyramine Resin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
