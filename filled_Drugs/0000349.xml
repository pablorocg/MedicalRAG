			<Question qid="0000349-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Dexrazoxane Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dexrazoxane injection (Totect, Zinecard) is used to prevent or decrease thickening of the heart muscles caused by doxorubicin in women who are taking the medication to treat breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Dexrazoxane injection (Totect, Zinecard) is only given to women who have already received a certain amount of doxorubicin and who will need continued doxorubicin treatment, it is not used to prevent heart damage in women who are starting treatment with doxorubicin. Dexrazoxane injection (Totect) is used to decrease damage to the skin and tissues that may be caused when an anthracycline chemotherapy medication such as daunorubicin (Cerubidine), doxorubicin (Adriamycin, Doxil), epirubicin (Ellence) or idarubicin (Idamycin) leaks out of a vein as it is being injected. Dexrazoxane injection is in classes of medications called cardioprotectants and chemoprotectants. It works by stopping the chemotherapy medications from damaging the heart and the tissues.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000349-2" qtype="usage">How should Dexrazoxane Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dexrazoxane injection comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid and injected into a vein by a doctor or nurse in a hospital. When dexrazoxane injection is used to prevent heart damage caused by doxorubicin, it is given over 15 minutes just before each dose of doxorubicin. When dexrazoxane injection is used to prevent tissue damage after an anthracycline medication has leaked out of a vein, it is given over 1 to 2 hours once a day for 3 days. The first dose is given as soon as possible within the first 6 hours after the leak occurs, and the second and third doses are given about 24 and 48 hours after the first dose.</Answer>
