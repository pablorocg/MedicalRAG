			<Question qid="0001113-2" qtype="usage">How should Silver Sulfadiazine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Silver sulfadiazine comes in a cream. Silver sulfadiazine usually is applied once or twice a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use silver sulfadiazine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply this drug to infants less than 2 months of age. Do not stop using silver sulfadiazine until your doctor tells you to do so. Your burn must be healed so that infection is no longer a problem. Gently wash the burned skin area daily to help remove dead skin. If your burn becomes infected or if your infection worsens, call your doctor. Before applying the medication, clean the burned area and remove any dead or burned skin. Always wear a sterile, disposable glove when you apply silver sulfadiazine. Cover the cleaned burned area with a 1/16-inch (0.2-centimeter) thickness of cream. Keep the burned area covered with cream at all times; reapply the cream to any area that becomes uncovered.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001113-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Silver Sulfadiazine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>

It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements.
