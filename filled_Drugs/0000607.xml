			<Question qid="0000607-2" qtype="usage">How should Iloprost be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Iloprost comes as a solution to inhale by mouth. It is usually inhaled six to nine times a day during waking hours. Use iloprost exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use iloprost inhalation solution with your delivery device. Carefully read the manufacturer's instructions that describe how to prepare and inhale a dose of iloprost. Be sure to ask your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse if you have any questions about how to prepare or inhale this medication. After each dose of medication, dispose of any solution remaining in the delivery device and carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning the delivery system components. Do not mix other medications with iloprost solution. Do not swallow iloprost solution. If iloprost solution gets on your skin or in your eyes, rinse your skin or eyes with water right away. Be careful not to use iloprost inhaler too close to other people, especially pregnant women and infants, so that they do not inhale the medication. Do not use iloprost inhaler more than once every two hours. Because the effects of the medication may not last 2 hours, you may need to adjust the timing of your doses to cover your planned activities. Iloprost solution is used with certain inhaler devices. Make sure you can get another delivery device to use right away if your device does not work for any reason. Iloprost is not available at retail pharmacies. Your medication will be mailed to you from a specialty pharmacy. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how you will receive your medication. Iloprost controls PAH but does not cure it. Continue to take iloprost even if you feel well. Do not stop taking iloprost without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient and a copy of the user's guide for the inhaler device.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000607-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Iloprost ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
