			<Question qid="0001106-2" qtype="usage">How should Sertaconazole Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Sertaconazole comes as a cream to apply to the skin. It is usually applied twice a day for 4 weeks. Use sertaconazole cream at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use sertaconazole exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your symptoms should improve in the first two weeks of your treatment. Continue to use sertaconazole cream even if your condition improves. If you stop using sertaconazole cream too soon, your infection may not be completely cured and your symptoms may return. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor. Sertaconazole cream is only for use on the skin. Keep sertaconazole cream away from your eyes, nostils, mouth, lips, vagina, and rectal area and do not swallow the medication. If you clean the affected area, allow it to dry, and then gently rub the cream into the skin. Wash your hands with soap and water after applying sertaconazole cream. Do not use any bandages, dressings, or wraps unless directed to do so by your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001106-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Sertaconazole Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
