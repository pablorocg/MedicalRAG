			<Answer>Magnesium hydroxide is used  to treat occasional constipation in children and adults on a short-term basis. Magnesium hydroxide is in a class of medications called saline laxatives.

			<Question qid="0000734-2" qtype="usage">How should Magnesium Hydroxide be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Magnesium hydroxide come as a chewable tablet, tablet, and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It usually is taken as a single daily dose (preferably at bedtime) or you may divide the dose into two or more parts over one day. Magnesium hydroxide usually causes a bowel movement within 30 minutes to 6 hours after taking it. Follow the directions on the package or on your product label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take magnesium hydroxide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you are giving magnesium hydroxide to your child, read the package label carefully to make sure that it is the right product for the age of the child. Do not give children magnesium hydroxide products that are made for adults. Check the package label to find out how much medication the child needs. Ask your child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give your child. Take the suspension, chewable tablets, and tablets with a full glass (8 ounces [240 milliliters]) of liquid. Do not take magnesium hydroxide for longer than 1 week without talking to your doctor. Shake the oral suspension well before each use.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000734-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Magnesium Hydroxide ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze the suspension. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
