			<Question qid="0001031-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Propylthiouracil ?</Question>
			<Answer>Propylthiouracil may cause severe liver damage in adults and children. Some people who took propylthiouracil needed liver transplants and some people died because of the liver damage. Because of this risk, propylthiouracil should only be given to people who cannot receive other treatments such as surgery, radioactive iodine, or a different medication called methimazole (Tapazole). Propylthiouracil may also be given to women during the first months (about 12 weeks) of pregnancy because methimazole may cause birth defects if it is used during this part of a pregnancy. If you are taking propylthiouracil, call your doctor immediately if you develop any of the following symptoms: fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, itching, dark urine, pale or light colored stools, yellowing of the skin or eyes, or pain in the upper right part of the stomach. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with propylthiouracil and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001031-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Propylthiouracil ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
