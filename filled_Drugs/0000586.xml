			<Question qid="0000586-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Hydrocortisone Oral and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hydrocortisone is used alone or with other medications to treat the symptoms of low corticosteroid levels (lack of certain substances that are usually produced by the body and are needed for normal body functioning). Hydrocortisone is also used to treat other conditions in patients with normal corticosteroid levels. These conditions include certain types of arthritis; severe allergic reactions; lupus (a disease in which the body attacks many of its own organs); and certain conditions that affect the lungs, skin, eyes, kidneys, blood, thyroid, stomach, and intestines. It is also sometimes used to treat the symptoms of certain types of cancer. Hydrocortisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works to treat patients with low levels of corticosteroids by replacing steroids that are normally produced naturally by the body. It works to treat other conditions by reducing swelling and redness and by changing the way the immune system works.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000586-2" qtype="usage">How should Hydrocortisone Oral be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hydrocortisone comes as a tablet and granules to  take by mouth. If you are taking the tablets, your doctor will prescribe a dosing schedule that is best for you. Hydrocortisone granules come in capsules and are usually taken 2 or 3 times a day. Hydrocortisone may be taken with food or milk to prevent stomach upset. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take hydrocortisone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. To take the granules, open the capsule(s) and either pour all of the granules directly from the capsule(s) into your child's mouth or pour the granules onto a clean spoon and place the spoonful of medication in your child's mouth. You can also pour all of the granules from the capsule(s) onto a spoonful of cold or room temperature soft food such as yogurt or a fruit-based soft food, such as applesauce. Swallow the granules or the mixture of soft food and granules right away (within 5 minutes) without chewing or crushing the granules. Take several sips of liquid such as water, formula, or breast milk right away to be sure that any leftover granules have been swallowed. Do not swallow the capsules that contain the granules. If your child vomits or spits up after taking a dose of hydrocortisone granules, call your doctor right away. Your doctor will tell you if you need to give your child another dose. Do not give another dose unless your doctor tells you to do so. Your doctor may change your dose of hydrocortisone often during your treatment to be sure that you are always taking the lowest dose that works for you. Your doctor may also need to change your dose if you experience unusual stress on your body such as surgery, illness, or infection. Tell your doctor if your symptoms improve or get worse or if you get sick or have any changes in your health during your treatment. Hydrocortisone may help control your condition but may not cure it. Continue to take hydrocortisone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking hydrocortisone without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking hydrocortisone, your body may not have enough natural steroids to function normally. This may cause extreme tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, an upset stomach, vomiting, drowsiness, joint and muscle pain, changes in skin color, and craving for salt. If you take large doses for a long time, your doctor probably will decrease your dose gradually to allow your body to adjust before stopping the drug completely. If these problems occur, call your doctor immediately. You may need to increase your dose of hydrocortisone temporarily or start taking it again.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000586-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Hydrocortisone Oral ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
