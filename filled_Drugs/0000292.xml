			<Question qid="0000292-2" qtype="usage">How should Corticotropin, Repository Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Corticotropin repository injection comes as a long acting gel to inject under the skin or into a muscle. When corticotropin repository injection is used to treat infantile spasms, it is usually injected into a muscle twice a day for two weeks and then injected on a gradually decreasing schedule for another two weeks. When corticotropin repository injection is used to treat multiple sclerosis, it is usually injected once a day for 2 to 3 weeks, and then the dose is gradually decreased. When corticotropin repository injection is used to treat other conditions, it is injected once every 24 to 72 hours, depending on the condition being treated and how well the medication works to treat the condition. Inject corticotropin repository injection at around the same time(s) of day on every day that you are told to inject it. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use corticotropin repository injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Continue to use corticotropin repository injection as long as it has been prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop using corticotropin repository injection without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using corticotropin repository injection, you may experience symptoms such as weakness, tiredness, pale skin, changes in skin color, weight loss, stomach pain, and loss of appetite. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. You can inject corticotropin repository injection yourself or have a relative or friend inject the medication. You or the person who will be performing the injections should read the manufacturer's directions for injecting the medication before you inject it for the first time at home. Your doctor will show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to perform the injections, or your doctor can arrange for a nurse to come to your home to show you how to inject the medication. You will need a needle and syringe to inject corticotropin. Ask your doctor which type of needle and syringe you should use. Do not share needles or syringes or use them more than once. Dispose of used needles and syringes in a puncture-proof container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-proof container. If you are injecting corticotropin repository injection under your skin, you can inject it anywhere in your upper thigh, upper arm, or stomach area except for your navel (belly button) and the 1 inch area around it. If you are injecting corticotropin repository injection into a muscle, you can inject it anywhere on your upper arm or upper outer thigh. If you are giving the injection to a baby you should inject it into the upper outer thigh. Choose a new spot at least 1 inch away from a spot where you have already injected the medication each time you inject it. Do not inject the medication into any area that is red, swollen, painful, hard, or sensitive, or that has tattoos, warts, scars, or birthmarks. Do not inject the medication into your knee or groin areas. Look at the vial of corticotropin repository injection before you prepare your dose. Be sure that the vial is labeled with the correct name of the medication and an expiration date that has not passed. The medication in the vial should be clear and colorless and should not be cloudy or contain flecks or particles. If you do not have the right medication, if your medication is expired or if it does not look as it should, call your pharmacist and do not use that vial. Allow your medication to warm to room temperature before you inject it. You can warm the medication by rolling the vial between your hands or holding it under your arm for a few minutes. If you are giving corticotropin repository injection to your child, you can hold your child on your lap or have your child lie flat while you are giving the injection. You may find it helpful to have someone else hold the child in position or distract the child with a noisy toy while you are injecting the medication. You can help decrease your child's pain by placing an ice cube on the spot where you will inject the medication before or after the injection. If you are giving corticotropin repository injection to your child to treat infantile spasms, your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when your child begins treatment with corticotropin repository injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000292-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Corticotropin, Repository Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it in the refrigerator. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
