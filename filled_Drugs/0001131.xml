			<Question qid="0001131-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Sotalol ?</Question>
			<Answer>Sotalol may cause QT prolongation (an irregular heart rhythm that can lead to fainting, loss of consciousness, seizures, or sudden death). For the first three days you take sotalol, you will have to be in a facility where your heart can be monitored. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had long QT syndrome (an inherited condition in which a person is more likely to have QT prolongation) or if you have or have ever had or you have or have ever had low levels of potassium in your blood, slow or irregular heartbeat, heart failure,  or kidney disease. Your doctor may tell you not to take sotalol. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before taking sotalol with your doctor and pharmacist. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat; fainting; or loss of consciousness. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your body's response to sotalol. Your heart rhythm should be checked regularly to determine your response to sotalol. Your doctor will also want to follow your kidney function and blood level of potassium closely while you are taking sotalol. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking sotolol.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001131-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Sotalol and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Sotalol is used to treat certain types of serious, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (abnormal heartbeats). Sotalol is also used to treat people who currently have normal heart rhythm, but have had symptomatic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in the past. Sotalol is in a class of medications called antiarrhythmics. It works by acting on the heart muscle to improve the heart's rhythm.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001131-3" qtype="usage">How should Sotalol be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Sotalol comes as a tablet and solution (liquid) to take by mouth. Sotalol tablets are usually taken two or three times a day. Sotalol oral solution is usually taken once a day in adults and three times a day in children. Take sotalol consistently, either with food or without food each time. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take sotalol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of sotolol and gradually increase your dose to allow your body to adjust to the medication. Sotalol controls your condition but does not cure it. Continue to take sotalol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking sotalol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking sotalol, you may experience serious heart problems such as angina (chest pain) or heart attack. Your doctor will probably want to decrease your dose gradually over 1 to 2 weeks. Your doctor will watch you carefully and will probably tell you to avoid physical activity during this time. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001131-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Sotalol ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
