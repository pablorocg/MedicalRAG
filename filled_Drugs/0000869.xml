			<Question qid="0000869-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Nintedanib and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nintedanib is used to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; scarring of the lungs with an unknown cause). It is also used to treat certain types of chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILD; an ongoing disease in which there is increased scarring of the lungs). Nintedanib is also used to slow the rate of decline in lung function in people with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD; also known as scleroderma-associated ILD: a disease in which there is scarring of the lungs that is often fatal). Nintedanib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of enzymes involved in causing fibrosis.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000869-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Nintedanib ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
