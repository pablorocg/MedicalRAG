			<Question qid="0000280-2" qtype="usage">How should Clorazepate be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Clorazepate comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken one to three times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take clorazepate exactly as directed. If you are taking clorazepate to treat anxiety or seizures, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of clorazepate and gradually increase your dose. If you are taking clorazepate to treat alcohol withdrawal, your doctor will probably start you on a high dose of clorazepate and gradually decrease your dose as your symptoms are controlled. Clorazepate may help to control seizures and anxiety, but it will not cure these conditions. Continue to take clorazepate even if you feel well.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000280-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Clorazepate ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
