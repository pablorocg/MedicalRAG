			<Question qid="0000814-1" qtype="why get vaccinated">Why get vaccinated with MMR Vaccine (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) ?</Question>
			<Answer>MMR vaccine can prevent measles, mumps, and rubella. Measles (M)
 causes fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes, commonly followed by a rash that covers the whole body. It can lead to seizures (often associated with fever), ear infections, diarrhea, and pneumonia. Rarely, measles can cause brain damage or death.,  Mumps (M)  causes fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen and tender glands under the ears. It can lead to deafness, swelling of the brain and/or spinal cord covering, painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and, very rarely, death.,  Rubella (R)  causes fever, sore throat, rash, headache, and eye irritation. It can cause arthritis in up to half of teenage and adult women. If a person gets rubella while they ares pregnant, they could have a miscarriage or the baby could be born with serious birth defects.,  Most people who are vaccinated with MMR will be protected for life. Vaccines and high rates of vaccination have made these diseases much less common in the United States.</Answer>
