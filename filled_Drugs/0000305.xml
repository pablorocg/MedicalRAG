			<Question qid="0000305-2" qtype="usage">How should Cyclosporine Ophthalmic be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ophthalmic cyclosporine comes as a solution (liquid) and as an emulsion (combination of two unmixable liquids) to instill in the eye. It is usually instilled in each eye twice a day, about 12 hours apart. Instill cyclosporine eye drops at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use cyclosporine eye drops exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of them or use them more often than prescribed by your doctor. Cyclosporine eye drops are for use only in the eye(s). Do not swallow or apply cyclosporine eye drops to the skin. Cyclosporine eye drops come in single-use vials (small bottles to be used for one dose) and in a multi-dose bottle (a bottle that can be used more than once). If you are using the single-use vials, the liquid from a vial should be used immediately after opening for one or both eyes. Be careful not to let the dropper tip touch your eye, fingers, face, or any surface. If the tip does touch another surface, bacteria may get into the eye drops. To instill the eye drops, follow these steps:
 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water., When using the multi-dose bottle for the first time, follow the instructions in the package to prepare the container for use., When using the emulsion, turn over the vial or bottle a few times until the liquid inside looks white and not see-through., Open the vial or remove the cap from the multi-use bottle., Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean., While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket., Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it., Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face., While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid., Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids., Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure., Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue., Discard the vial out of the reach of children even if it is not empty. Replace the cap on the multi-use bottle., Wash your hands to remove any medication., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000305-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Cyclosporine Ophthalmic ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Discard each single-use vial after one use in a place that is out of reach of children and pets. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
