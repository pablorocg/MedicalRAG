			<Question qid="0000837-2" qtype="usage">How should Naloxegol be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Naloxegol comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the first meal of the day. Take naloxegol at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take naloxegol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you are unable to swallow the tablets whole, crush the tablet to a powder and mix it in a glass with 4 ounces (120 mL) of water. Drink the mixture immediately. Then, refill the glass with 4 ounces (120 mL) of water, stir the contents, and drink the remaining mixture contents. If you have a nasogastric (NG) tube, your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to prepare naloxegol tablets to give through a NG tube. You should stop taking other laxative medications before you start taking naloxegol. Be sure to let your doctor know if naloxegol does not work for you after taking it for 3 days. Your doctor may tell you to take other laxative medication(s). Tell your doctor if you stop taking opiate (narcotic) medications. Your doctor will probably tell you to stop taking naloxegol.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000837-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Naloxegol ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
