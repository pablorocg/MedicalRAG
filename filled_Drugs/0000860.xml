			<Question qid="0000860-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Nicotine Gum and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nicotine chewing gum is used to help people stop smoking cigarettes. Nicotine chewing gum should be used together with a smoking cessation program, which may include support groups, counseling, or specific behavioral change techniques. Nicotine gum is in a class of medications called smoking cessation aids. It works by providing nicotine to your body to decrease the withdrawal symptoms experienced when smoking is stopped and as a substitute oral activity to reduce the urge to smoke.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000860-2" qtype="usage">How should Nicotine Gum be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nicotine gum is used by mouth as a chewing gum and should not be swallowed. Follow the directions on your package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nicotine gum exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed on the package label or as recommended by your doctor. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2-mg gum. People who smoke their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up should use the 4-mg gum. Nicotine gum may be used regularly by chewing one piece of gum every 1 to 2 hours for the first 6 weeks, followed by one piece every 2 to 4 hours for 3 weeks, and then one piece every 4 to 8 hours for 3 weeks. If you have strong or frequent cravings, you may chew a second piece within one hour. To improve your chances of quitting smoking, chew at least 9 pieces of nicotine gum each day for the first 6 weeks. Chew nicotine gum slowly until you can taste the nicotine or feel a slight tingling in your mouth. Then stop chewing and place (park) the chewing gum between your cheek and gum. When the tingling is almost gone (about 1 minute), start chewing again; repeat this procedure for about 30 minutes. Avoid eating and drinking for 15 minutes before and during chewing of nicotine gum. Do not chew nicotine gum too fast, do not chew more than one piece of gum at a time, and do not chew one piece too soon after another. Chewing one piece of gum after another continuously may cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea, or other side effects. Do not chew more than 24 pieces a day. You should stop using nicotine gum after 12 weeks of use. If you still feel the need to use nicotine gum after 12 weeks, talk to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000860-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Nicotine Gum ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children and pets. Wrap used pieces of nicotine gum in paper and throw them away in the trash. Store nicotine gum at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
