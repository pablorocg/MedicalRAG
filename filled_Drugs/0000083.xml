			<Question qid="0000083-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Arformoterol Oral Inhalation and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Arformoterol inhalation is used to control wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of lung diseases, which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema). Arformoterol is in a class of medications called long-acting beta agonists (LABAs). It works by relaxing and opening air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000083-3" qtype="usage">How should Arformoterol Oral Inhalation be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Arformoterol comes as a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). It is usually inhaled twice a day in the morning and the evening. Inhale arformoterol at around the same times every day, and space your doses about 12 hours apart. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use arformoterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not swallow or inject arformoterol inhalation. Do not use arformoterol inhalation to treat sudden attacks of COPD. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting beta agonist medication such as albuterol (Accuneb, Proair, Proventil, Ventolin) to use during attacks. If you were using this type of medication on a regular basis before you began treatment with arformoterol, your doctor will probably tell you to stop using it regularly, but to continue to use it to treat attacks. If your COPD symptoms become worse, if arformoterol inhalation becomes less effective, if you need more doses than usual of the medication you use to treat sudden attacks, or if the medication you use to treat attacks does not relieve your symptoms, your condition may be getting worse. Do not use extra doses of arformoterol. Call your doctor right away. Arformoterol controls the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but does not cure the condition. Continue to use arformoterol even if you feel well. Do not stop using arformoterol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using arformoterol, your symptoms may worsen. To use arformoterol inhalation, follow these steps:
 Open the foil pouch by tearing through the rough edge along the edge of the pouch and remove the vial. Look at the solution in the vial to be sure it is colorless. If it is not colorless, call your doctor or pharmacist and do not use the solution., Twist off the top of the vial and squeeze all of the liquid into the reservoir of your nebulizer. Do not add any other medications to the nebulizer because it may not be safe to mix them with arformoterol. Use all nebulized medications separately unless your doctor specifically tells you to mix them., Connect the nebulizer reservoir to your mouthpiece or facemask., Connect the nebulizer to the compressor., Sit upright and place the mouthpiece in your mouth or put on the facemask., Turn on the compressor., Breathe calmly, deeply, and evenly until mist stops forming in the nebulizer. This should take between 5 and 10 minutes., Clean the nebulizer according to the manufacturer's instructions.,  Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000083-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Arformoterol Oral Inhalation ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the foil pouch it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Protect the medication from heat and light. You may store the medication in the refrigerator until the expiration date printed on the package has passed, or you may store the medication at room temperature for up to 6 weeks. Dispose of any medication that has been stored at room temperature for longer than 6 weeks, or that has been removed from the foil pouch and not used immediately. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
