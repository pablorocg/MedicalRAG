			<Question qid="0000161-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Brexpiprazole ?</Question>
			<Answer>Important warning for older adults with dementia: Studies have shown that older adults with dementia (a brain disorder that affects the ability to remember, think clearly, communicate, and perform daily activities and that may cause changes in mood and personality) who take antipsychotics (medications for mental illness) such as brexpiprazole have an increased chance of death during treatment. Older adults with dementia may also have a greater chance of having a stroke or ministroke during treatment with antipsychotics. Brexpiprazole is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of people with dementia-related psychosis who do not have agitation. Talk to the doctor who prescribed this medication if you, a family member, or someone you care for has dementia and is taking brexpiprazole. For more information visit the FDA website:  http://www.fda.gov/Drugs . Important warning for people who have depression: A small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took medications for depression during clinical studies became suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions. However, experts are not sure about how great this risk is and how much it should be considered in deciding whether a child or teenager should take an antidepressant. Children younger than 18 years of age should not normally take brexpiprazole to treat depression, but in some cases, a doctor may decide that brexpiprazole is the best medication to treat a child's condition. You should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take brexpiprazole or other antidepressants even if you are an adult over age 24. You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; new or worsening anxiety; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood). Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own. Talk to your doctor about the risk(s) of taking brexpiprazole.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000161-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Brexpiprazole and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Brexpiprazole is used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia (a mental illness that causes disturbed or unusual thinking, loss of interest in life, and strong or inappropriate emotions) in adults and children 13 years of age and older. It is also used with an antidepressant to treat depression when symptoms cannot be controlled by the antidepressant alone. Brexpiprazole is also used to treat agitation in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (a brain disease that slowly destroys the memory and ability to think, learn, communicate, and handle daily activities). Brexpiprazole is in a class of medications called atypical antipsychotics. It works by changing the activity of certain natural substances in the brain.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000161-3" qtype="usage">How should Brexpiprazole be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Brexpiprazole comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once daily with or without food. Take brexpiprazole at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take brexpiprazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of brexpiprazole and gradually increase your dose depending on how well the medication works for you and the side effects you experience. Brexpiprazole may control your symptoms  but will not cure your condition. Continue to take brexpiprazole even if you feel well. Do not stop taking brexpiprazole without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000161-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Brexpiprazole ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
