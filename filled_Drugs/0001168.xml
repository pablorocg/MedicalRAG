			<Question qid="0001168-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Telavancin Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Telavancin injection is used alone or with other medications to treat serious skin infections caused by certain types of bacteria. It is also used alone or with other medications to treat certain types of pneumonia caused by bacteria when there are no other treatment options available. Telavancin injection is in a class of medications called lipoglycopeptide antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria that cause infection. Antibiotics such as telavancin injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001168-3" qtype="usage">How should Telavancin Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Telavancin injection comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid and injected intravenously (into a vein).

You may experience a reaction while you receive a dose of telavancin injection, usually during your infusion or soon after your infusion has completed. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms while you receive telavancin injection: sudden reddening of the face, neck, upper chest, or other body part; difficulty swallowing or breathing; swelling of your tongue, lips, throat or face; hoarseness; itching; hives; rash; fast heartbeat; or feeling faint or dizzy. You may receive telavancin injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you will be using telavancin injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to infuse the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions.

If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, tell your doctor. Use telavancin injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using telavancin injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>
