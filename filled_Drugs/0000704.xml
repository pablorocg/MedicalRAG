			<Question qid="0000704-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Linaclotide and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Linaclotide is used in adults to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C; a condition that causes stomach pain or cramps, bloating, and infrequent or difficult passage of stools) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC; difficult or infrequent passage of stools that lasts for 3 months or longer and is not caused by a disease or a medication). Linaclotide is also used in children 6 to 17 years of age to treat functional constipation (FC; difficult, painful, or infrequent passage of stools that is not caused by a medical condition). Linaclotide is in a class of medications called guanylate cyclase-C agonists. It works by increasing the movement of food and waste through the stomach and intestines.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000704-3" qtype="usage">How should Linaclotide be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Linaclotide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day on an empty stomach, at least thirty minutes before a meal. Take linaclotide at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take linaclotide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If you cannot swallow the capsules or if you are giving this medication to a child, you may open the capsules and sprinkle the beads they contain over one teaspoonful of room temperature applesauce or into a cup containing 1 ounce (30 mL) of room temperature bottled water. Do not mix the beads with other foods or liquids. If you sprinkle the contents of the capsules into water, gently swirl the beads and water for at least 20 seconds. Swallow the mixture of applesauce or water and medication right away without chewing or crushing the beads. If you sprinkled the beads into water and you see beads in the cup, rinse the cup with 1 ounce (30 mL) of water, swirl the contents for at least 20 seconds, and drink the water right away to be sure you swallow any leftover beads. The contents of linaclotide capsules can be given through a feeding tube.If you have a feeding tube, ask your doctor or pharmacist how you should take the medication. Follow those directions carefully. Linaclotide controls the symptoms of IBS-C, CIC,  and FC but does not cure these conditions. Your constipation symptoms may improve in 1 week, and it may take slightly longer for your stomach pain to improve. Continue to take linaclotide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking linaclotide without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking linaclotide, your symptoms may return in about 1 week.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000704-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Linaclotide ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not remove the desiccant (drying agent) from the bottle, if one has been provided. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
