			<Question qid="0000198-2" qtype="usage">How should Carfilzomib Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Carfilzomib comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein). Carfilzomib is given by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or clinic usually over a period of 10 or 30 minutes. It may be given 2 days in a row each week for 3 weeks followed by a 12-day rest period or it may be given once a week for 3 weeks followed by a 13-day rest period. The length of treatment will depend on how well your body responds to the medication. Carfilzomib injection may cause severe or life-threatening reactions for up to 24 hours after you receive a dose of the medication. You will receive certain medications to help prevent a reaction before you receive each dose of carfilzomib. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms after your treatment: fever, chills, joint or muscle pain, flushing or swelling of the face, swelling or tightening of the throat, vomiting, weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness or fainting, or chest tightness or pain. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment.
