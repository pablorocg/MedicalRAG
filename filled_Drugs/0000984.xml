			<Question qid="0000984-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Pilocarpine Ophthalmic and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pilocarpine ophthalmic is used to treat glaucoma (a condition in which increased pressure in the eye can lead to gradual loss of vision) and ocular hypertension (a condition which causes increased pressure in the eye). Pilocarpine ophthalmic is also used to prevent or reduce increased pressure in the eye during and after certain types of laser eye surgery. It is also used during an eye exam to constrict (close) the pupil (the black part of the eye through which you see). Pilocarpine ophthalmic (Vuity, Qlosi) is used to treat presbyopia (a condition in which the lens of the eye loses its ability to focus making hard to see objects up close) in adults. Pilocarpine is in a class of medications called miotics. Pilocarpine ophthalmic treats glaucoma and ocular hypertension by allowing excess fluid to drain from the eye. Pilocarpine ophthalmic treats presbyopia by reducing the size of the pupils which helps to see objects up close.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000984-2" qtype="usage">How should Pilocarpine Ophthalmic be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pilocarpine ophthalmic comes as a 0.4, 1, 1.25, 2, and 4% solution (liquid) to instill in the eyes.  For the treatment of glaucoma or ocular hypertension, one drop of the 1, 2, or 4% solution is usually into the affected eye(s) up to four times daily. To prevent or reduce increased pressure in the eye during and after certain types of laser eye surgery, one or two drops of the 1, 2, or 4% solution are usually instilled into the affected eye(s) 15 to 60 minutes before surgery. For the treatment of presbyopia, one drop of the 1.25% solution (Vuity) is usually instilled into the affected eyes once a day or one drop of the 0.4% solution (Qlosi) into the affected eyes up to twice a day (eye drop can be repeated after 2 to 3 hours for an effect of 8 hours) as needed to control symptoms. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use pilocarpine eye drops exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Pilocarpine eye drops control your condition, but will not cure it. Continue to use pilocarpine eye drops even if you feel well. Do not stop using pilocarpine eye drops without talking to your doctor. If you are using another topical eye medication, instill it at least 5 minutes before or after you instill pilocarpine eye drops. Be careful not to let the tip of the bottle touch your eye, fingers, face, or any surface. If the tip does touch another surface, bacteria may get into the eye drops. To instill the eye drops, follow these steps:
 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water., Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked., Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean., While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket., Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it., Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face., While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid., Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids., Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure for 2 minutes., Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue., If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop., Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip., Wash your hands to remove any medication., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000984-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Pilocarpine Ophthalmic ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep the medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Pilocarpine 0.4% ophthalmic solution (Qlosi) comes in single dose vials that should be stored in the refrigerator. Once the vial is removed from its foil packet, it can be stored at room temperature for 30 days. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
