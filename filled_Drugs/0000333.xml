			<Question qid="0000333-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Delavirdine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Delavirdine is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Delavirdine is in a class of medications called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although delavirdine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000333-2" qtype="usage">How should Delavirdine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Delavirdine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken three times a day with or without food. Take delavirdine around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take delavirdine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you have trouble swallowing the 100-mg tablets, they may be dispersed in water. To prepare, add four tablets to at least 3 ounces (90 milliliters) of water, allow to stand for a few minutes, and then stir until all tablets dissolve. Drink the delavirdine-water mixture right away. Rinse the glass and swallow the rinse to ensure that you have gotten the entire dose. The 200-mg tablets (which are smaller than the 100-mg tablets) should always be swallowed whole, because they do not readily dissolve in water. Your doctor may tell you to take delavirdine tablets with orange or cranberry juice if you have certain medical conditions such as achlorhydria (a condition in which stomach has little or no acid). Follow these directions carefully. Delavirdine may control HIV but will not cure it. Continue to take delavirdine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking delavirdine or any of the other medications that you are taking to treat HIV or AIDS without talking to your doctor. When your supply of delavirdine starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. If you miss doses or stop taking delavirdine, your condition may become more difficult to treat. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000333-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Delavirdine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
