			<Question qid="0001163-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Tedizolid and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tedizolid is used to treat skin infections caused by certain types of bacteria in adults and children 12 years of age and older. Tedizolid is in a class of medications called oxazolidinone antibiotics. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics such as tedizolid will not work for colds, flu, and other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001163-2" qtype="usage">How should Tedizolid be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tedizolid comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day for 6 days. Take tedizolid at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tedizolid exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with tedizolid. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Continue to take tedizolid until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. Do not skip doses or stop taking tedizolid without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking tedizolid too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001163-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Tedizolid ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture not in the bathroom. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
