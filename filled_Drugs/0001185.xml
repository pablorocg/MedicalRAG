			<Question qid="0001185-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Teriparatide (rDNA origin) Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Teriparatide injection is used to treat osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) in women who have undergone menopause ('change in life,' end of menstrual periods), who are at high risk of fractures (broken bones), and cannot use other osteoporosis treatments. It is also used to increase bone mass in men with certain types of osteoporosis who are at high risk for having broken bones (fractures), and who cannot use other osteoporosis treatments. Teriparatide injection is also used to treat osteoporosis in men and women who are taking corticosteroids (a type of medication that may cause osteoporosis in some patients) who are at high risk of fractures (broken bones), and cannot use other osteoporosis treatments. Teriparatide injection contains a synthetic form of natural human hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH). It works by causing the body to build new bone and by increasing bone strength and density (thickness).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001185-3" qtype="usage">How should Teriparatide (rDNA origin) Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Teriparatide injection comes as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (under the skin) in your thigh or lower stomach area. This medication comes in prefilled dosing pens. It is usually injected once a day for up to 2 years. To help you remember to use teriparatide injection, use it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use teriparatide injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You can inject teriparatide injection yourself or have a friend or relative perform the injections. Before you use teriparatide injection yourself the first time, read the User Manual that comes with it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it. The User Manual includes solutions to problems you may have when you try to use teriparatide injection. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions about how to inject this medication. Teriparatide injection comes in a pen that contains enough medication for 28 doses. Do not transfer the medication to a syringe. Use a new needle for each injection. Needles are sold separately. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the type of needles to use. Dispose of used needles in a puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container. Teriparatide injection controls osteoporosis but does not cure it. Continue to use teriparatide injection even if you feel well. Do not stop using teriparatide injection without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001185-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Teriparatide (rDNA origin) Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the pen it came in with the cap on and without a needle attached, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it in the refrigerator but do not freeze it. Protect it from light. Discard the pen after 28 days of use, even if it is not empty. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
