			<Question qid="0001074-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Risperidone Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Studies have shown that older adults with dementia (a brain disorder that affects the ability to remember, think clearly, communicate, and perform daily activities and that may cause changes in mood and personality) who take or use antipsychotics (medications for mental illness) such as risperidone have an increased risk of death during treatment. Risperidone extended-release (long-acting) injection is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of behavior problems in older adults with dementia. Talk to the doctor who prescribed this medication if you, a family member, or someone you care for has dementia and is taking or receiving risperidone. For more information visit the FDA website:  http://www.fda.gov/Drugs . Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving risperidone extended-release injection.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001074-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Risperidone Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Risperidone extended-release injection (Perseris, Risperdal Consta, Rykindo, Uzedy) is used to treat schizophrenia (a mental illness that causes disturbed or unusual thinking, loss of interest in life, and strong or inappropriate emotions). Risperidone extended-release injection (Risperdal Consta, Rykindo) is used alone or in combination with lithium (Lithobid) or valproate to treat people who have bipolar I disorder (manic depressive disorder; a disease that causes episodes of depression, episodes of severe mania, and other abnormal moods). Risperidone is in a class of medications called atypical antipsychotics. It works by changing the activity of certain natural substances in the brain.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001074-3" qtype="usage">How should Risperidone Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Risperidone extended-release injection (Risperdal Consta, Rykindo) comes as a powder to be mixed with a liquid to inject intramuscularly (into a muscle) by a healthcare provider. Risperidone extended-release injection (Perseris) comes as a powder to be mixed with a liquid to inject subcutaneously (under the skin) by a healthcare provider. Risperidone extended-release injection (Uzedy) comes as a suspension (liquid) to inject subcutaneously by a healthcare provider. If you have never received risperidone extended-release injection previously, your doctor will probably tell you to take risperidone tablets or oral solution by mouth before you receive your first injection. Risperidone extended-release injection (Risperdal Consta) is usually injected intramuscularly once every 2 weeks into the buttocks or upper arm. Risperidone extended-release injection (Rykindo) is usually injected intramuscularly once every 2 weeks into the buttocks. You will need to take risperidone tablets or another antipsychotic medication by mouth for the first 1 to 3 weeks after receiving your first injection of risperidone extended-release intramuscular injection. After at least 4 weeks of therapy, your doctor may increase your dose depending on your response to this medication. Risperidone extended-release injection (Perseris) is usually injected subcutaneously once a month in your upper arm or abdomen. Risperidone extended-release injection (Uzedy) is usually injected subcutaneously once a month or once every 2 months in your upper arm or abdomen. Risperidone extended-release injection may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to keep appointments to receive risperidone injection even if you feel well. Talk to your doctor if you do not feel like you are getting better during your treatment with risperidone injection.</Answer>
