			<Question qid="0000710-2" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Liotrix ?</Question>
			<Answer>Thyroid hormones should not be used to treat obesity in patients with normal thyroid function. Liotrix is ineffective for weight reduction in normal thyroid patients and may cause serious or life-threatening toxicity, especially when taken with amphetamines such as benzphetamine (Didrex), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine, in Adderall), methamphetamine (Desoxyn). Talk to your doctor about the potential risks associated with this medication.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000710-3" qtype="indication">Who should get Liotrix and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Liotrix is used to treat hypothyroidism (a condition that results when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone). Symptoms of hypothyroidism include lack of energy, depression, constipation, weight gain, hair loss, dry skin, dry coarse hair, muscle cramps, decreased concentration, aches and pains, swelling of the legs, and increased sensitivity to cold. When taken correctly, liotrix can reverse these symptoms. Liotrix is also used to treat goiter (enlarged thyroid gland). This medication is also used to test for hyperthyroidism (a condition where the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone). Liotrix is in a class of medications called thyroid agents. It works by supplying the thyroid hormones normally produced by the body.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000710-4" qtype="usage">How should Liotrix be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Liotrix comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day before breakfast or the first food of the day. Take liotrix at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take liotrix exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of liotrix and gradually increase your dose not more than once every 2 to 3 weeks. Liotrix controls hypothyroidism but does not cure it. It may take several weeks before you feel the full benefit of liotrix. Continue to take liotrix even if you feel well. Do not stop taking liotrix without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000710-10" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Liotrix ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed and out of reach of children. Store the tablets in the refrigerator. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
