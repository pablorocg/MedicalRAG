			<Question qid="0000889-2" qtype="usage">How should Ofloxacin Otic be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ofloxacin otic comes as a solution (liquid) to place into the ear. It is usually used once or twice a day for 7 to 14 days, depending on your condition. Use ofloxacin otic at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ofloxacin otic exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Ofloxacin otic is only for use in the ears. Do not use in the eyes. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with ofloxacin otic. If your symptoms do not improve after one week or get worse, call your doctor. Use ofloxacin otic until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using ofloxacin otic too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics. To use the eardrops, follow these steps:
 Hold the bottle or single-dispensing container(s) in your hand for 1 or 2 minutes to warm the solution., Lie down with the affected ear upward., Place the prescribed number of drops or the contents of the prescribed number of single-dispensing containers into your ear , If you are using a bottle of solution, be careful not to touch the tip to your ear, fingers, or any other surface., For middle ear infections, push the tragus (small flap of cartilage just in front of the ear canal near the face) of the ear inward four times so that the drops will enter the middle ear., Remain lying down with the affected ear upward for 5 minutes., Repeat steps 1-6 for the opposite ear if necessary., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000889-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Ofloxacin Otic ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Protect from light. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
