			<Question qid="0000104-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Axitinib and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Axitinib is used alone to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC, a type of cancer that begins in the cells of the kidneys) in people who have not been treated successfully with another medication. Axitinib is used in combination with avelumab (Bavencio) or pembrolizumab (Keytruda) to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma. Axitinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000104-2" qtype="usage">How should Axitinib be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Axitinib comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food two times a day. Take axitinib at around the same times every day, about 12 hours apart. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take axitinib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water; do not split, chew, or crush them. If you vomit after taking axitinib, do not take another dose. Continue your regular dosing schedule. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of axitinib and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 2 weeks. This depends on how well the medication works for you and any side effects you might experience. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment. Continue to take axitinib even if you feel well. Do not stop taking axitinib without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000104-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Axitinib ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.
