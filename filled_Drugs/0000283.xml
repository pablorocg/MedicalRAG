			<Question qid="0000283-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Co-trimoxazole and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Co-trimoxazole is used to treat certain bacterial infections, such as pneumonia (a lung infection), bronchitis (infection of the tubes leading to the lungs), and infections of the urinary tract, ears, and intestines. It also is used to treat 'travelers' diarrhea. Co-trimoxazole is a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and is in a class of medications called sulfonamides. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics will not kill viruses that can cause colds, flu, or other viral infections.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000283-2" qtype="usage">How should Co-trimoxazole be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Co-trimoxazole comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It usually is taken two times a day but may be taken up to four times a day when used to treat certain severe lung infections. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take co-trimoxazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with co-trimoxazole. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor. Shake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Take co-trimoxazole until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. Do not stop taking co-trimoxazole without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking co-trimoxazole too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000283-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Co-trimoxazole ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000283-10" qtype="other information">What other information should I know about Co-trimoxazole ?</Question>
