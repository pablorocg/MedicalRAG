			<Answer>Risk of severe, life-threatening birth defects caused by pomalidomide. For all patients taking pomalidomide: Pomalidomide must not be taken by patients who are pregnant or who may become pregnant. There is a high risk that pomalidomide will cause loss of the pregnancy or will cause the baby to be born with birth defects (problems that are present at birth). A program called Pomalyst REMS &#174;  has been set up to make sure that pregnant women do not take pomalidomide and that women do not become pregnant while taking pomalidomide. All patients, including women who cannot become pregnant and men, can get pomalidomide only if they are registered with Pomalyst REMS &#174; , have a prescription from a doctor who is registered with Pomalyst REMS &#174; , and fill the prescription at a pharmacy that is registered with Pomalyst REMS &#174; . You will receive information about the risks of taking pomalidomide and must sign an informed consent sheet stating that you understand this information before you can receive the medication. You will need to see your doctor during your treatment to talk about your condition and the side effects you are experiencing or to have pregnancy tests as recommended by the program. Tell your doctor if you do not understand everything you were told about pomalidomide and the Pomalyst REMS &#174;  program and how to use the birth control methods discussed with your doctor, or if you do not think you will be able to keep appointments. Do not donate blood while you are taking pomalidomide and for 4 weeks after your treatment. Do not share pomalidomide with anyone else, even someone who has the same symptoms that you have. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with pomalidomide and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or  http://www.celgeneriskmanagement.com  to obtain the Medication Guide. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking pomalidomide. For female patients taking pomalidomide: If you can become pregnant, you will need to meet certain requirements during your treatment with pomalidomide. You need to meet these requirements even if you have had a tubal ligation ('tubes tied,' surgery to prevent pregnancy). You may be excused from meeting these requirements only if you have not menstruated for 24 months in a row and your doctor says you have passed menopause ('change of life') or you have had surgery to remove your uterus and/or both ovaries. If none of these are true for you, then you must meet the requirements below. You must use two acceptable forms of birth control for 4 weeks before you begin to take pomalidomide, during your treatment, including at times when your doctor tells you to temporarily stop taking pomalidomide, and for 4 weeks after your treatment. Your doctor will tell you which forms of birth control are acceptable and will give you written information about birth control. You must use these two forms of birth control at all times unless you can promise that you will not have any sexual contact with a male for 4 weeks before your treatment, during your treatment, during any interruptions in your treatment, and for 4 weeks after your treatment. If you choose to take pomalidomide, it is your responsibility to avoid pregnancy for 4 weeks before, during, and for 4 weeks after your treatment. You must understand that any form of birth control can fail. Therefore, it is very important to decrease the risk of accidental pregnancy by using two forms of birth control. Tell your doctor if you do not understand everything you were told about birth control or you do not think that you will be able to use two forms of birth control at all times. You must have two negative pregnancy tests before you can begin to take pomalidomide. You will also need to be tested for pregnancy in a laboratory at certain times during your treatment. Your doctor will tell you when and where to have these tests. Stop taking pomalidomide and call your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant, you miss a menstrual period, or you have sex without using two forms of birth control. If you become pregnant during your treatment or within 30 days after your treatment, your doctor will contact the Pomalyst REMS &#174;  program, the manufacturer of pomalidomide, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For male patients taking pomalidomide: Pomalidomide is present in semen (fluid containing sperm that is released through the penis during orgasm). You must use a latex or synthetic condom, even if you have had a vasectomy (surgery that prevents a man from causing a pregnancy), every time you have sexual contact with a female who is pregnant or able to become pregnant while you are taking pomalidomide and for 28 days after your treatment. Tell your doctor if you have sexual contact with a female without using a condom or if your partner thinks she may be pregnant during your treatment with pomalidomide. Do not donate sperm while you are taking pomalidomide and for 4 weeks after your treatment. Risk of blood clots: If you are taking pomalidomide to treat multiple myeloma (a type of cancer of the bone marrow), there is a risk that you will develop a heart attack, a stroke, or a blood clot in your leg (deep vein thrombosis; DVT) that may move through the bloodstream to your lungs (pulmonary embolism, PE). Tell your doctor if you have had a heart attack or a stroke. Your doctor may tell you not to take pomalidomide. Also tell your doctor if you smoke or use tobacco, if you have had a heart attack or a stroke, and if you have or have ever had high blood pressure, or high blood levels of cholesterol or fats, Your doctor may prescribe other medication to be taken along with pomalidomide to decrease this risk. If you experience any of the following symptoms while taking pomalidomide, tell your doctor immediately: severe headache; vomiting; speech problems; dizziness or faintness; sudden complete or partial loss of vision; weakness or numbness of an arm or a leg; chest pain that may spread to the arms, neck, jaw, back, or stomach; shortness of breath; confusion; or pain, swelling, or redness in one leg. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking pomalidomide.</Answer>

It is also used to treat Kaposi's sarcoma (a type of cancer that causes abnormal tissue to grow on different parts of the body) related to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) after unsuccessful treatment with other medications or in people with Kaposi's sarcoma who are do not have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Pomalidomide is in a class of medications called immunomodulatory agents. It works by helping the bone marrow to produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow.</Answer>

Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the capsules whole with water; do not break or chew them. Do not open the capsules or handle them more than necessary. If your skin comes into contact with broken capsules or powder, wash the exposed area with soap and water. If any capsule contents get in your eyes, wash your eyes right away with water. Your doctor may need to permanently or temporarily stop your treatment or reduce your dose if you experience certain side effects. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with pomalidomide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001001-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Pomalidomide ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Return any medication that is no longer needed to your pharmacy or the manufacturer. Ask your pharmacist if you have any questions about returning your medication. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
