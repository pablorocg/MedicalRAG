			<Question qid="0000596-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Ibandronate and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ibandronate is used to prevent and treat osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) in women who have undergone menopause (''change of life,'' end of menstrual periods). Ibandronate is in a class of medications called bisphosphonates. It works by preventing bone breakdown and increasing bone density (thickness).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000596-2" qtype="usage">How should Ibandronate be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ibandronate comes as a tablet to take by mouth. The 2.5-mg tablet is usually taken once a day in the morning on an empty stomach and the 150-mg tablet is usually taken once a month in the morning on an empty stomach. The 150-mg tablet should be taken on the same date each month. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ibandronate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Ibandronate may not work properly and may damage the esophagus (tube between the mouth and stomach) or cause sores in the mouth if it is not taken according to the following instructions. Tell your doctor if you do not understand, you do not think you will remember, or you are unable to follow these instructions:
 You must take ibandronate just after you get out of bed in the morning, before you eat or drink anything. Never take ibandronate at bedtime or before you wake up and get out of bed for the day., Swallow the tablets with a full glass (6 to 8 ounces [180 to 240 mL]) of plain water. Never take ibandronate with tea, coffee, juice, milk, mineral water, sparkling water, or any liquid other than plain water., Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Do not suck on the tablets., After you take ibandronate, do not eat, drink, or take any other medications (including vitamins or antacids) for at least 60 minutes. Do not lie down for at least 60 minutes after you take ibandronate. Sit upright or stand upright for at least 60 minutes.,  Ibandronate controls osteoporosis but does not cure it. Ibandronate helps to treat and prevent osteoporosis only as long as it is taken regularly. Continue to take ibandronate even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ibandronate without talking to your doctor, but talk to your doctor from time to time about whether you still need to take ibandronate. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with ibandronate and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000596-4" qtype="precautions">Are there safety concerns or special precautions about Ibandronate ?</Question>

Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients., tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: angiogenesis inhibitors such as bevacizumab (Avastin), everolimus (Afinitor, Zortress), pazopanib (Votrient), sorafenib (Nexavar), or sunitinib (Sutent); aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Ibu-Tab, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprelan, Naprosyn, others); cancer chemotherapy; and oral steroids such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Rayos).

Call your doctor right away if you experience severe pain at any time during your treatment with ibandronate. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking ibandronate and your pain may go away after you stop taking the medication., talk to your doctor about other things you can do to prevent osteoporosis from developing or worsening. Your doctor will probably tell you to avoid smoking and drinking large amounts of alcohol and to follow a regular program of weight-bearing exercise., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000596-7" qtype="side effects">What are the side effects or risks of Ibandronate ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ibandronate may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
 nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation, weakness, dizziness, headache, fever, sore throat, chills, cough, and other signs of infection, frequent or urgent need to urinate, painful urination,  Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately before you take any more ibandronate:
 new or worsening heartburn, difficulty swallowing, pain on swallowing, upper chest pain, rash, painful or swollen gums, loosening of the teeth, numbness or heavy feeling in the jaw, poor healing of the jaw, dull, aching pain in the hips, groin, or thighs,  Ibandronate may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication. Taking a bisphosphonate medication such as ibandronate for osteoporosis may increase the risk that you will break your thigh bone(s). You may feel pain in your hips, groin, or thighs for several weeks or months before the bone(s) break, and you may find that one or both of your thigh bones have broken even though you have not fallen or experienced other trauma. It is unusual for the thigh bone to break in healthy people, but people who have osteoporosis may break this bone even if they do not take ibandronate. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking ibandronate. If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online ( http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch ) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000596-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Ibandronate ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
