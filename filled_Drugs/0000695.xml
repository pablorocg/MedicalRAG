			<Answer>Using levofloxacin injection increases the risk that you will develop tendinitis (swelling of a fibrous tissue that connects a bone to a muscle) or have a tendon rupture (tearing of a fibrous tissue that connects a bone to a muscle) during your treatment or for up to several months afterward. These problems may affect tendons in your shoulder, your hand, the back of your ankle, or in other parts of your body. Tendinitis or tendon rupture may happen to people of any age, but the risk is highest in people over 60 years of age. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a kidney, heart, or lung transplant; kidney disease; a joint or tendon disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis (a condition in which the body attacks its own joints, causing pain, swelling, and loss of function); or if you participate in regular physical activity. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking oral or injectable steroids such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos). If you experience any of the following symptoms of tendinitis, stop using levofloxacin injection, rest, and call your doctor immediately: pain, swelling, tenderness, stiffness, or difficulty in moving a muscle. If you experience any of the following symptoms of tendon rupture, stop using levofloxacin injection and get emergency medical treatment: hearing or feeling a snap or pop in a tendon area, bruising after an injury to a tendon area, or inability to move or to bear weight on an affected area. Using levofloxacin injection may cause changes in sensation and nerve damage that may not go away even after you stop using levofloxacin. This damage may occur soon after you begin using levofloxacin injection. Tell your doctor if you have ever had peripheral neuropathy (a type of nerve damage that causes tingling, numbness, and pain in the hands and feet). If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop using levofloxacin and call your doctor immediately: numbness, tingling, pain, burning, or weakness in the arms or legs; or a change in your ability to feel light touch, vibrations, pain, heat, or cold.  Using levofloxacin injection may affect your brain or nervous system and cause serious side effects. This can occur after the first dose of levofloxacin injection. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had seizures, epilepsy, cerebral arteriosclerosis (narrowing of blood vessels in or near the brain that can lead to stroke or ministroke), stroke, changed brain structure, or kidney disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop using levofloxacin injection and call your doctor immediately: seizures; tremors; dizziness; lightheadedness; headaches that won't go away (with or without blurred vision); difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; nightmares; not trusting others or feeling that others want to hurt you; hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist); thoughts or actions towards hurting or killing yourself; feeling restless, anxious, nervous, depressed, memory problems, or confused, or other changes in your mood or behavior. Using levofloxacin injection may worsen muscle weakness in people with myasthenia gravis (a disorder of the nervous system that causes muscle weakness) and cause severe difficulty breathing or death. Tell your doctor if you have myasthenia gravis. Your doctor may tell you not to use levofloxacin injection. If you have myasthenia gravis and your doctor tells you that you should use levofloxacin injection, call your doctor immediately if you experience muscle weakness or difficulty breathing during your treatment. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using levofloxacin injection. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with levofloxacin injection. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000695-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Levofloxacin Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Levofloxacin injection is used to treat infections such as pneumonia; and kidney, prostate (a male reproductive gland), and skin infections. Levofloxacin injection is also used to prevent anthrax (a serious infection that may be spread on purpose as part of a bioterror attack) in people who may have been exposed to anthrax germs in the air and treat and prevent plague (a serious infection that may be spread on purpose as part of a bioterror attack. Levofloxacin may also be used to treat bronchitis, sinus infections, or urinary tract infections but should not be used for bronchitis and certain types of urinary tract infections if there are other treatment options available. Levofloxacin injection is in a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. It works by killing bacteria that cause infections. Antibiotics such as levofloxacin injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000695-3" qtype="usage">How should Levofloxacin Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Levofloxacin injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be given through a needle or catheter placed in your vein. It is usually infused (injected slowly) intravenously (into a vein) over a period of 60 or 90 minutes, once every 24 hours. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have. Your doctor will tell you how long to use levofloxacin injection. You may receive levofloxacin injection in a hospital or you may use the medication at home. If you will be using levofloxacin injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to infuse the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Ask your healthcare provider what to do if you have any problems infusing levofloxacin injection. You should begin feeling better during the first few days of your treatment with levofloxacin injection. If your symptoms do not improve, or if they get worse, call your doctor. Use levofloxacin injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. Do not stop using levofloxacin injection without talking to your doctor unless you experience certain serious side effects listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING or SIDE EFFECTS sections. If you stop using levofloxacin injection too soon or if you skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>
