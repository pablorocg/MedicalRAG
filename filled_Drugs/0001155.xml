Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Tafluprost ophthalmic comes in single-use containers. The solution from one container should be used immediately after opening for one or both eyes. Dispose of each single-use container and any remaining solution after one use.

			<Question qid="0001155-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Tafluprost Ophthalmic ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store unopened foil pouches containing tafluprost solution in the refrigerator. When you open the foil pouch, write down the date you opened it in the space provided on the pouch. Store opened foil pouches containing single-use containers of tafluprost solution at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Dispose of any unused single-use containers left in the foil pouch more than 28 days after it was first opened. Do not use tafluprost if the foil pouch is not sealed when you first receive it. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
