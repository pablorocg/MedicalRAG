			<Question qid="0000353-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Dextromethorphan and Quinidine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine is used to treat pseudobulbar affect (PBA; a condition of sudden, frequent outbursts of crying or laughing that can not be controlled) in people with certain conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease; condition in which the nerves that control muscle movement slowly die, causing the muscles to shrink and weaken) or multiple sclerosis (a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and patients may experience weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control). Dextromethorphan is in a class of medications called central nervous system agents. The way it works in the brain to treat PBA is not known.  Quinidine is in a class of medications called antiarrhythmics. When combined with dextromethorphan, quinidine works by increasing the amount of dextromethorphan in the body.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000353-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Dextromethorphan and Quinidine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children and pets. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
