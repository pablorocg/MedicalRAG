			<Question qid="0001275-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Vancomycin and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Vancomycin is used to treat colitis (inflammation of the intestine caused by certain bacteria) that may occur after antibiotic treatment. Vancomycin is in a class of medications called glycopeptide antibiotics. It works by killling bacteria in the intestines. Vancomycin will not kill bacteria or treat infections in any other part of the body when taken by mouth. Antibiotics such as vancomycin will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001275-2" qtype="usage">How should Vancomycin be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Vancomycin comes as a capsule and oral solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken 3-4 times a day for 7-10 days. To help you remember to take vancomycin, take it around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take vancomycin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Shake the oral solution well before each use to mix the medication evenly. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with vancomycin. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Take vancomycin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking vancomycin too soon or miss doses, your infection may not be completely cured and bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001275-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Vancomycin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store vancomycin capsules at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Store vancomyin oral solution in the refrigerator. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
