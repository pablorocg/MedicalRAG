			<Question qid="0001193-1" qtype="why get vaccinated">Why get vaccinated with Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tdap vaccine can prevent tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Diphtheria and pertussis spread from person to person. Tetanus enters the body through cuts or wounds. TETANUS (T)  causes painful stiffening of the muscles. Tetanus can lead to serious health problems, including being unable to open the mouth, having trouble swallowing and breathing, or death. DIPHTHERIA (D)  can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure, paralysis, or death. PERTUSSIS (aP)  , also known as "whooping cough," can cause uncontrollable, violent coughing that makes it hard to breathe, eat, or drink. Pertussis can be extremely serious especially in babies and young children, causing pneumonia, convulsions, brain damage, or death. In teens and adults, it can cause weight loss, loss of bladder control, passing out, and rib fractures from severe coughing.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001193-2" qtype="information">What is Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tdap is only for children 7 years and older, adolescents, and adults. Adolescents should receive a single dose of Tdap, preferably at age 11 or 12 years. .Pregnant people should get a dose of Tdap during every pregnancy, preferably during the early part of the third trimester, to help protect the newborn from pertussis. Infants are most at risk for severe, lifethreatening complications from pertussis. Adults who have never received Tdap should get a dose of Tdap. Also, adults should receive a booster dose of either Tdap or Td (a different vaccine that protects against tetanus and diphtheria but not pertussis) every 10 years, or after 5 years in the case of a severe or dirty wound or burn. Tdap may be given at the same time as other vaccines.</Answer>
