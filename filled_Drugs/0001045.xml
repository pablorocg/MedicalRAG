			<Question qid="0001045-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Rabeprazole and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rabeprazole is used to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which backward flow of acid from the stomach causes heartburn and possible injury of the esophagus (the tube that connects the throat and stomach) in adults and children 12 year of age and older. Rabeprazole is used to treat damage from GERD, allow the esophagus to heal, and prevent further damage to the esophagus in adults. Rabeprazole is also used to treat conditions in which the stomach produces too much acid, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in adults. Rabeprazole is used to treat ulcers (sores in the lining of the stomach or intestine) and is used in combination with other medications to eliminate  H. pylori  (a bacteria that causes ulcers) in adults. Rabeprazole is in a class of medications called proton-pump inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of acid made in the stomach.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001045-2" qtype="usage">How should Rabeprazole be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rabeprazole comes as a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent break-down of the medication by stomach acids) tablet to take by mouth. The delayed-release tablets are usually taken once a day. When used to treat ulcers, rabeprazole tablets are taken after the morning meal. When used in combination with other medications to eliminate  H. pylori , rabeprazole tablets are taken twice a day, with the morning and evening meals, for 7 days. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rabeprazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often or for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole with water; do not split, chew, or crush them. Continue to take rabeprazole even if you feel well. Do not stop taking rabeprazole without talking to your doctor. If your condition does not improve or gets worse, call your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001045-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Rabeprazole ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
