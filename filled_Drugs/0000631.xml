			<Question qid="0000631-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Interferon beta-1a Intramuscular Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Interferon beta-1a intramuscular injection is used to treat adults with various forms of multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and people may experience weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination, and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control) including:
 clinically isolated syndrome (CIS; nerve symptom episodes that last at least 24 hours),, relapsing-remitting forms (course of disease where symptoms flare up from time to time), or, secondary progressive forms (course of disease where relapses occur more often).,  Interferon beta-1a is in a class of medications called immunomodulators. It works by decreasing inflammation and preventing nerve damage that may cause symptoms of multiple sclerosis.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000631-2" qtype="usage">How should Interferon beta-1a Intramuscular Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Interferon beta-1a intramuscular injection comes as a solution (liquid) in prefilled injection syringes and in a prefilled automatic injection pen. This medication is injected into a muscle, usually once a week, on the same day each week. Inject interferon beta-1a intramuscular at around the same time of day on your injection days. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use interferon beta-1a exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of interferon beta-1a and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every week. Interferon beta-1a controls the symptoms of MS but does not cure it. Continue to use interferon beta-1a even if you feel well. Do not stop using interferon beta-1a without talking to your doctor. Your doctor or nurse will show you or a caregiver how to prepare and inject a dose of interferon beta-1a injection at home. Before you use interferon beta-1a intramuscular for the first time, you or the person who will be giving the injections should also read the manufacturer's information for the patient that comes with it.  These instructions describe how to prepare and inject a dose of interferon beta-1a. Be sure that you understand these directions and follow the directions carefully. Always use a new prefilled syringe and needle or prefilled automatic injection pen for each injection. Never reuse syringes, needles, or automatic injection pens. Discard used syringes, needles, and injection pens in a puncture-resistant container, kept out of reach of children. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to discard the puncture-resistant container. Always look at the medication in your prefilled syringe or automatic injection pen before you use it. The medication should be clear and colorless. If the solution is cloudy, discolored, or contains particles or if the expiration date marked on the prefilled syringe or automatic injection pen has passed, do not use that prefilled syringe or automatic injection pen. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about where on your body you should inject interferon beta-1a intramuscular. If you are using a prefilled syringe, you can inject interferon beta-1a intramuscular in your upper arms or thighs. If you are using a prefilled autoinjection pen, you can inject interferon beta-1a intramuscular in the outer surface of your upper thighs. Use a different spot for each injection. Do not use the same spot two times in a row. Do not inject into an area where the skin is sore, red, bruised, scarred, infected, irritated, or abnormal in any way. Two hours after you inject interferon beta-1 intramuscular, you should check the injection site for a skin reaction such as redness, swelling, or tenderness. Call your doctor if you have a skin reaction at the injection site that does not go away in few days. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (medication guide) when you begin treatment with interferon beta-1a and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) to obtain the interferon beta-1a Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000631-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Interferon beta-1a Intramuscular Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store interferon beta-1a intramuscular prefilled syringes and automatic injection pens in the refrigerator. Do not freeze interferon beta-1a, and do not expose the medication to high temperatures. If a refrigerator is not available, you can store prefilled syringes and injection pens at room temperature, away from heat and light, for up to 7 days. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
