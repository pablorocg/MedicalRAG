			<Answer>Receiving natalizumab injection products may increase the risk that you will develop progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML; a rare infection of the brain that cannot be treated, prevented, or cured and that usually causes death or severe disability). The chance that you will develop PML during your treatment with natalizumab products is higher if you have one or more of the following risk factors. A blood test shows that you have been exposed to John Cunningham virus (JCV; a virus that many people are exposed to during childhood that usually causes no symptoms but may cause PML in people with weakened immune systems)., You have received many doses of natalizumab products, especially if you have received treatment for longer than 2 years., You have ever been treated with certain medications that weaken the immune system.,  Your doctor will probably order a blood test before or during your treatment with a natalizumab injection product to see if you have been exposed to JCV. If the test shows that you have been exposed to JCV, you and your doctor may decide that you should not receive a natalizumab injection product, especially if you also have one or both of the other risk factors listed above. If the test does not show that you have been exposed to JCV, your doctor may repeat the test from time to time during your treatment with natalizumab injection products. You should not be tested if you have had a plasma exchange (treatment in which the liquid part of the blood is removed from the body and replaced with other fluids) during the past 2 weeks because test results will not be accurate. There are other factors that may also increase the risk that you will develop PML. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had PML, an organ transplant, or another condition that affects your immune system such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), leukemia (cancer that causes too many blood cells to be produced and released into the bloodstream), or lymphoma (cancer that develops in the cells of the immune system). Also tell your doctor if you are taking or if you have ever taken any other medications that affect the immune system. Your doctor may tell you that you should not receive natalizumab injection. Because of the risks with this medication, natalizumab injection products are available only through a special restricted distribution program. Programs have been set up by the manufacturers of natalizumab injection products to be sure that people do not use natalizumab injection products without the necessary monitoring; these are called the TOUCH and TYRUKO REMS programs. You can only receive natalizumab injection products if you are registered with the TOUCH or TYRUKO program, if a natalizumab product is prescribed for you by a doctor who is registered with one of these programs, and if you receive the medication at an infusion center that is registered with one of these programs. Your doctor will give you more information about the program, will have you sign an enrollment form, and will answer any questions you have about the program and your treatment with natalizumab injection products. Your doctor or nurse will give you a copy of the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) before you begin treatment with a natalizumab injection product and before you receive each infusion. Read this information very carefully each time you receive it and ask your doctor or nurse if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide. Your doctor will need to see you every 3 months at the beginning of your treatment, then every 6 months during your treatment to decide whether you should continue using natalizumab products, and then at least 6 months after treatment is stopped. You will also need to answer some questions before you receive each infusion to be sure that natalizumab products is still right for you and other questions after treatment is stopped. Call your doctor immediately if you develop any new or worsening medical problems during your treatment, and for 6 months after your final dose. Be especially sure to call your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms: weakness on one side of the body that worsens over time; clumsiness of the arms or legs; changes in your thinking, memory, walking, balance, eyesight, or strength that last several days; confusion; or personality changes. If your treatment with a natalizumab injection product is stopped because you have PML, you may develop another condition called immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS; swelling and worsening of symptoms that may occur as the immune system begins to work again after certain medications that affect it are started or stopped), especially if you receive a treatment to remove natalizumab products from your blood more quickly. Your doctor will watch you carefully for signs of IRIS and will treat these symptoms if they occur. Tell all the doctors who treat you that you are receiving a natalizumab injection product. Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving a natalizumab injection product.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000844-3" qtype="usage">How should Natalizumab Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Natalizumab injection products come as a concentrated solution (liquid) to be diluted and injected slowly into a vein by a doctor or nurse. It is usually given once every 4 weeks in a registered infusion center. It will take about 1 hour for you to receive your entire dose of a natalizumab injection product. Natalizumab injection products may cause serious allergic reactions that are most likely to happen within 2 hours after the beginning of an infusion but may happen at any time during your treatment. You will have to stay at the infusion center for 1 hour after your infusion is finished for at least the first 12 infusions. A doctor or nurse will monitor you during this time to see if you are having a serious reaction to the medication. Tell your doctor or nurse if you experience any unusual symptoms such as hives, rash, itching, difficulty swallowing or breathing, wheezing, fever, dizziness, chest pain, flushing, nausea, or chills, especially if they occur within 2 hours after the start of your infusion. If you are receiving a natalizumab injection product to treat Crohn's disease, your symptoms should improve during the first few months of your treatment. Tell your doctor if your symptoms have not improved after 12 weeks of treatment. Your doctor may stop treating you with natalizumab injection products. Natalizumab injection products may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Keep all appointments to receive a natalizumab injection product even if you feel well.</Answer>
