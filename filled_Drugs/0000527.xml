			<Question qid="0000527-2" qtype="usage">How should Fluticasone Oral Inhalation be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Fluticasone comes as an aerosol to inhale by mouth using an inhaler and as a powder to inhale by mouth using an inhaler. Fluticasone aerosol oral inhalation (Flovent HFA) is usually inhaled twice daily. Fluticasone powder for oral inhalation is usually inhaled once daily (Armonair, Arnuity Ellipta) or twice daily (Armonair Respiclick, Flovent Diskus). Try to use fluticasone at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use fluticasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Talk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with fluticasone inhalation. If you are using any other inhaled medications, ask your doctor if you should inhale these medications a certain amount of time before and after you inhale fluticasone inhalation. If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting at least 1 week after you begin to use fluticasone. Fluticasone helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Do not use fluticasone during an asthma attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks. Your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of fluticasone. Your doctor may decrease your dose when your symptoms are controlled or increase it if your symptoms have not improved after at least 2 weeks. Fluticasone controls asthma but does not cure it. Your symptoms may improve 24 hours after you begin using fluticasone, but it may take 2 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of the medication. Continue to use fluticasone even if you feel well. Do not stop using fluticasone without talking to your doctor. If your child will be using the inhaler, be sure that they know how to use it. Watch your child each time they use the inhaler to be sure that they are using it correctly. Tell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment. Call your doctor if you have an asthma attack that does not stop when you use your fast-acting asthma medication, or if you need to use more of your fast-acting medication than usual. The inhaler that comes with fluticasone aerosol is designed for use only with a canister of fluticasone. Never use it to inhale any other medication, and never use any other inhaler to inhale fluticasone. Each product is designed to provide 30, 60, or120 inhalations, depending on the type of inhaler. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last. Dispose of the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. Do not float the canister in water to see if it still contains medication. Do not use your fluticasone aerosol inhaler while you are near an open flame or a heat source. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures. Before you use fluticasone the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it. Practice using the inhaler while they watch you.</Answer>

Call your doctor right away if you get sick and be sure that all healthcare providers who treat you know that you recently replaced your oral steroid with fluticasone inhalation. Carry a card or wear a medical identification bracelet to let emergency personnel know that you may need to be treated with steroids in an emergency., tell your doctor if you have never had chickenpox or measles and you have not been vaccinated against these infections. Stay away from people who are sick, especially people who have chickenpox or measles. If you are exposed to one of these infections or if you develop symptoms of one of these infections, call your doctor right away. You may need treatment to protect you from these infections., you should know that fluticasone inhalation sometimes causes wheezing and difficulty breathing immediately after it is inhaled. If this happens, use your fast-acting (rescue) asthma medication right away and call your doctor. Do not use fluticasone inhalation again unless your doctor tells you that you should., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000527-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Fluticasone Oral Inhalation ?</Question>
			<Answer>Store your fluticasone aerosol inhaler with the mouthpiece pointing down. Store it out of reach of children, at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). If you are using the fluticasone powder for inhalation (Flovent Diskus) 50 mcg or the Arnuity Ellipta 50 mcg, 100, mcg, or 200 mcg, you must dispose of the inhaler 6 weeks after opening the foil pouch or after every blister has been used (when the dose counter reads 0), whichever comes first. If you are using the fluticasone powder for inhalation (Flovent Diskus) 100 mcg or 250 mcg, you must dispose of the inhaler 2 months after opening the foil pouch or after every blister has been used (when the dose counter reads 0), whichever comes first. If you are using the fluticasone powder for inhalation (Armonair Respiclick), you must dispose of it 30 days after opening the foil pouch or (when the dose counter reads 0), whichever comes first. Do not store the inhaler near a heat source or an open flame. Protect the inhaler from freezing and direct sunlight. Do not puncture the aerosol container and do not dispose of it in an incinerator or fire. Your medication may come with a desiccant packet (small packet that contains a substance that absorbs moisture to keep the medication dry) in the container. Do not eat or inhale it. Throw it away in the household trash out of reach of children and pets. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
