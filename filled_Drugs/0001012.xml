			<Question qid="0001012-2" qtype="usage">How should Praziquantel be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Praziquantel comes as a tablet to take by mouth with water and a meal. It is usually taken for one day as three doses; each dose spaced 4 to 6 hours apart. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take praziquantel exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Praziquantel tablets are marked with 3 notches so that they can easily be split. If your doctor has told you to take only part of a tablet, use your thumbnail to press down on the correct notch and separate the number of parts needed for your dose. Swallow the tablets or tablet parts whole as soon as you put them into your mouth. Do not chew them, crush them, or hold them in your mouth. The bitter taste of the tablets may cause you to gag or vomit if you keep the tablets in your mouth before swallowing.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001012-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Praziquantel ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
