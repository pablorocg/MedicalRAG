			<Question qid="0000159-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Bosutinib and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Bosutinib is used to treat a certain type of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; a type of cancer of the white blood cells), including treatment in adults who have been recently found to have this condition and in those who can no longer benefit from other medications for CML or who cannot take these medications because of side effects. Bosutinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop the spread of cancer cells.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000159-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Bosutinib ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
