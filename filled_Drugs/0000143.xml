			<Question qid="0000143-3" qtype="usage">How should Bevacizumab Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Bevacizumab injection products come as a solution (liquid) to administer slowly into a vein. Bevacizumab injection products are administered by a doctor or nurse in a medical office, infusion center, or hospital. Bevacizumab injection products are usually given once every 2 or 3 weeks. Your dosing schedule will depend on the condition that you have, the other medications you are using, and how well your body responds to treatment. It should take 90 minutes for you to receive your first dose of a bevacizumab injection product. A doctor or nurse will watch you closely to see how your body reacts to bevacizumab. If you do not have any serious problems when you receive your first dose of a bevacizumab injection product, it will usually take 30 to 60 minutes for you to receive each of your remaining doses of the medication. Bevacizumab injection products may cause serious reactions during infusion of the medication. If you experience any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor immediately: difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chills, shaking, sweating, headaches, chest pain, dizziness, feeling faint, flushing, itching, rash, or hives. Your doctor may need to slow down your infusion, or delay or stop your treatment if you experience these or other side effects.</Answer>
