			<Question qid="0000348-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Dexmethylphenidate ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dexmethylphenidate can be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, take it for a longer time, or take it in a different way than prescribed by your doctor. If you take too much dexmethylphenidate, you may continue to feel a need to take large amounts of the medication, and you may experience unusual changes in your behavior. You or your caregiver should tell your doctor immediately, if you experience any of the following symptoms: fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat; sweating; dilated pupils; abnormally excited mood; restlessness; difficulty falling sleeping or staying asleep; hostility; aggression; anxiety; loss of appetite; loss of coordination; uncontrollable movement of a part of the body; flushed skin; vomiting; stomach pain; or thinking about harming or killing oneself or others or planning or trying to do so. Also, tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, use or have ever used street drugs, or have overused prescription medications. Do not stop taking dexmethylphenidate without talking to your doctor, especially if you have overused the medication. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually and monitor you carefully during this time. You may develop severe depression if you suddenly stop taking dexmethylphenidate after overusing it. Your doctor may need to monitor you carefully after you stop taking dexmethylphenidate, even if you have not overused the medication, because your symptoms may worsen when treatment is stopped. Do not sell, give away, or let anyone else take your medication. Selling or giving away dexmethylphenidate is against the law and may harm others. Store dexmethylphenidate in a safe place where no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Keep track of how many tablets or capsules are left so you will know if any are missing. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with dexmethylphenidate and each time you get more medication. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000348-3" qtype="usage">How should Dexmethylphenidate be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dexmethylphenidate comes as a tablet and an extended-release (long-acting) capsule to take by mouth. The tablet is usually taken twice a day, at least 4 hours apart, with or without food. The extended-release capsule is usually taken once a day in the morning. It may be taken with or without food, but will start to work faster if it is taken without food . Take dexmethylphenidate at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Swallow the extended-release capsules whole; do not chew or crush them. If you are unable to swallow the extended-release capsule, you can carefully open the capsule and sprinkle the contents on a spoonful of applesauce. Swallow this mixture immediately, but do not chew it. Do not save this mixture to use at a later time. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of dexmethylphenidate and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once a week. Your condition should improve during your treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms worsen at any time during your treatment or do not improve after 1 month. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking dexmethylphenidate from time to time to see if the medication is still needed. Follow these directions carefully.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000348-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Dexmethylphenidate ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
