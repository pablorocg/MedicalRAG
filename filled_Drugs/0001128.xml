			<Question qid="0001128-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Solifenacin and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Solifenacin (VESIcare) is used to treat overactive bladder (a condition in which the bladder muscles contract uncontrollably and cause frequent urination, urgent need to urinate, and inability to control urination). Solifenacin (VESIcare LS) is used to treat neurogenic detrusor overactivity (a bladder control condition caused by brain, spinal cord or nerve problem) in children 2 years of age and older.

			<Question qid="0001128-2" qtype="usage">How should Solifenacin be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Solifenacin comes as a tablet  (VESIcare) and a suspension (liquid; VESIcare LS) to take by mouth. Solifenacin tablets are usually taken once a day with or without food. Solifenacin suspension (VESIcare LS) is usually taken once a day. To help you remember to take solifenacin, take it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take solifenacin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use an oral dosing syringe to measure the correct amount of medication. You can swallow the suspension straight from the syringe followed by a small glass of water or milk. To avoid a bitter taste, avoid taking the suspension with another liquid or food. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Swallow the tablets with water or another liquid. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of solifenacin and increase your dose later in your treatment. Solifenacin may help to control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to take solifenacin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking solifenacin without talking to your doctor. </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001128-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Solifenacin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
