			<Question qid="0001237-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Trandolapril and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Trandolapril is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. It is also used to improve survival in patients with heart failure after a heart attack. Trandolapril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly and the heart can pump blood more efficiently. High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001237-3" qtype="usage">How should Trandolapril be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Trandolapril comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food. To help you remember to take trandolapril, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take trandolapril exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of trandolapril and gradually increase your dose, not more than once a week. Trandolapril controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take trandolapril even if you feel well. Do not stop taking trandolapril without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001237-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Trandolapril ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
