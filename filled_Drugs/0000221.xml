			<Answer>The combination of ceftolozane and tazobactam is used to treat certain infections including urinary tract infections and infections of the abdomen (stomach area).

It works by killing bacteria. Tazobactam is in a class called beta-lactamase inhibitor. It works by preventing bacteria from destroying ceftolozane. Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections.</Answer>
