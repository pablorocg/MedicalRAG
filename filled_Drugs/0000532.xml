			<Answer>If you have an epidural or spinal anesthesia or a spinal puncture while using a 'blood thinner' such as fondaparinux injection, you are at risk for having a blood clot form in or around your spine that could cause you to become paralyzed. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had spinal surgery, problems with pain medication given through the spine, a spinal deformity, or if you have bleeding problems. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking other anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin), anagrelide (Agrylin), aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen), cilostazol (Pletal), clopidogrel (Plavix), dipyridamole (Persantine), eptifibatide (Integrilin), prasugrel (Effient), ticlopidine, and tirofiban (Aggrastat). If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: muscle weakness, numbness or tingling (especially in your legs), or inability to move your legs. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain tests to check your body's response to fondaparinux injection.

			<Question qid="0000532-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Fondaparinux Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>

			<Question qid="0000532-3" qtype="usage">How should Fondaparinux Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Fondaparinux injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected subcutaneously (just under the skin) in the lower stomach area. It is usually given one time a day for 5 to 9 days or sometimes for up to about 1 month. You will probably begin using fondaparinux injection while you are in the hospital at least 6 to 8 hours after your surgery. Use fondaparinux injection at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use fondaparinux injection exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you will continue to use fondaparinux after your hospital stay, you can inject fondaparinux yourself or have a friend or relative perform the injections. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it. Before you use fondaparinux injection yourself the first time, read the Patient Information that comes with it. This information includes directions for how to use and inject fondaparinux prefilled safety syringes. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions about how to inject this medication. Each syringe has enough medication in it for one shot. Do not use the syringe and needle more than one time. Your doctor, pharmacist, or healthcare provider will tell you how to dispose of used needles and syringes safely. Do not mix fondaparinux injection with other medications or solutions.</Answer>
