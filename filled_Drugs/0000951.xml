			<Answer>Peginterferon beta-1a injection is used to treat adults with various forms of multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and people may experience weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination, and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control) including the following: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS; nerve symptom episodes that last at least 24 hours),, relapsing-remitting forms (course of disease where symptoms flare up from time to time), or, secondary progressive forms (course of disease where relapses occur more often).,  Peginterferon beta-1a injection is in a class of medications called immunomodulators. It works by decreasing inflammation and preventing nerve damage that may cause symptoms of multiple sclerosis.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000951-2" qtype="usage">How should Peginterferon Beta-1a Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Peginterferon beta-1a injection comes as a solution (liquid) in a dosing pen or a prefilled syringe to inject subcutaneously (under the skin) or intramuscularly (into the muscle) in a prefilled syringe. It is usually injected once every 14 days. Inject peginterferon beta-1a injection at around the same time of day each time you inject it. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use peginterferon beta-1a injection exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of peginterferon beta-1a injection for the first two doses so that your body can adjust to the medication. Your doctor may decide that you or a friend or relative can perform the injections at home. Your doctor will show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it. Carefully read the manufacturer's instructions for use that come with the medication. These instructions describe how to inject a dose of peginterferon beta-1a. Be sure to ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to inject the medication. Peginterferon beta-1a injection may help to control multiple sclerosis but does not cure it. Continue to use peginterferon beta-1a injection even if you feel well. Do not stop using peginterferon beta-1a injection without talking to your doctor. Use a new prefilled syringe or dosing pen each time you inject your medication. Do not reuse or share syringes or pens.  Dispose of used syringes or pens in a puncture resistant container that is out of the reach of children. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container. Before you are ready to inject peginterferon beta-1a, you will need to remove the medication from the refrigerator, and allow it to rest for around 30 minutes so that it can warm to room temperature. Do not try to warm the medication by heating it in a microwave, placing it in hot water, or through any other method. Always look at the medication in your prefilled syringe or pen before you use it. Prefilled syringes and dosing pens for subcutaneous injection should be clear and colorless but may have small air bubbles. Prefilled syringes for intramuscular injection should be clear and colorless to pale yellow. If the medication is cloudy, colored, or contains particles or if the expiration date marked on the pen or syringe has passed, do not use that pen or syringe. If you are using a pen, also check to be sure that there are green stripes in the injection status window. Do not use the pen if it does not have green stripes in the injection status window. If injecting peginterferon beta-1a subcutaneously, you can inject anywhere on your stomach, the back of your upper arms, or your thighs. If injecting peginterferon beta-1a intramuscularly, you can inject anywhere on your thighs. Choose a different spot each time you inject your medication. Do not inject your medication into skin that is irritated, bruised, reddened, infected, or scarred. You may experience flu-like symptoms such as headaches, bone or muscle aches, fever, chills, and tiredness during your treatment with peginterferon beta-1a. You should drink plenty of water during your treatment to help prevent or control these symptoms. Your doctor may tell you to take a nonprescription medication that relieves pain and prevents fever before or after you inject your medication to help treat or prevent these symptoms. Talk to your doctor about which other medication(s) you should take during your treatment. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with peginterferon beta-1a and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000951-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Peginterferon Beta-1a Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the carton it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it in a refrigerator, but do not freeze it. If you cannot keep the medication in a refrigerator, you may store it at room temperature, away from heat, light, and moisture for up to 30 days. Dispose of any medication that has been frozen or that is outdated or no longer needed. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
