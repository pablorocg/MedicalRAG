Follow the directions on the label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use clioquinol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than indicated on the product label. Thoroughly clean the infected area, allow it to dry, and then gently rub the medication in until most of it disappears. Use just enough medication to cover the affected area.

			<Question qid="0000270-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Clioquinol Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze. Protect it from light. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000270-7" qtype="other information">What other information should I know about Clioquinol Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep all appointments with your doctor. Clioquinol is for external use only and may stain your clothes, hair, skin, and nails yellow. Do not let clioquinol get into your eyes or mouth, and do not swallow it. Do not apply cosmetics, lotions, or other skin products to the area being treated unless your doctor tells you. Do not let anyone else use your medication. If you still have the symptoms of infection after you finish the clioquinol, call your doctor. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.</Answer>
