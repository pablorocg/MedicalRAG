			<Question qid="0000185-2" qtype="usage">How should Calcitonin Salmon Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Calcitonin salmon comes as a solution to be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) or into the muscle (intramuscularly). It is usually used once a day or once every other day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use calcitonin salmon injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist will show you how to administer the medication. Follow all directions carefully. Dispose of all empty syringes and vials as directed by your healthcare provider. Before preparing a dose, look at the vial. If the solution is discolored or contains particles, do not use it, and call your pharmacist. Calcitonin salmon helps treat osteoporosis and Paget's disease of bone but does not cure them. Continue to use calcitonin salmon even if you feel well. Do not stop using calcitonin salmon without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Answer>Store calcitonin salmon injection in its original container in the refrigerator. Do not freeze this medicine or shake the vials.
