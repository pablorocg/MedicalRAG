			<Question qid="0000209-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Cefditoren and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cefditoren is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria such as bronchitis (infection of the airway tubes leading to the lungs); pneumonia; and infections of the skin, throat, and tonsils.Cefditoren is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as cefditoren will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000209-2" qtype="usage">How should Cefditoren be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cefditoren comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken every 12 hours with the morning and evening meals for 10 to 14 days, depending on the condition being treated. Take cefditoren at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cefditoren exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You should begin to feel better during your first few days of treatment with cefditoren. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Take cefditoren until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking cefditoren too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely cured and bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000209-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Cefditoren ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light and excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).  Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
