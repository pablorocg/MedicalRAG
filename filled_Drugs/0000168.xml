			<Question qid="0000168-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Budesonide Oral and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Budesonide (Entocort EC) is used to treat Crohn's disease (a condition in which the body attacks the lining of the digestive tract, causing pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever). Budesonide (Tarpeyo) is used to decrease protein in the urine in patients with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (kidney disease that occurs in some people when too much immunoglobin A builds up in the kidney, causing inflammation). Budesonide is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by decreasing inflammation (swelling) in the digestive tract of people who have Crohn's disease or in the kidney of people with nephropathy.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000168-2" qtype="usage">How should Budesonide Oral be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Budesonide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day in the morning. Take budesonide at around the same time every day. Budesonide (Tarpeyo) should be taken at least one hour before a meal. Your doctor will tell you how long to take budesonide. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take budesonide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If you are unable to swallow the budesonide (Entocort EC) capsules whole, the capsules may be opened and sprinkled on a tablespoonful of apple sauce, mixed well and swallowed whole with no chewing within 30 minutes of mixing. The applesauce mixture should be followed by a full glass of water. Budesonide may help control your symptoms, but it will not cure your condition. Your doctor will watch you carefully to see how well budesonide works for you. If your symptoms are controlled, your doctor may decrease your dose of budesonide. After your symptoms have been controlled for 3 months, your doctor may slowly decrease your dose and then stop treating you with this medication. It is important to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000168-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Budesonide Oral ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
