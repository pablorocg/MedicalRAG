			<Question qid="0000877-2" qtype="usage">How should Nivolumab Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nivolumab comes as a liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) over 30 minutes by a doctor or nurse in a hospital or medical facility. When nivolumab is given alone, it is usually given once every 2 or 4 weeks for as long as your doctor recommends that you receive treatment. When nivolumab is given in combination with ipilimumab or other chemotherapy medications, it is usually given once every 2, 3, or 4 weeks for as long as your doctor recommends that you receive treatment. Your doctor will decide how often you are to receive nivolumab based on your condition and your body's response to the medication. Nivolumab may cause serious or life-threatening reactions during an infusion. A doctor or nurse will watch you closely while you are receiving the infusion and shortly after the infusion to be sure you are not having a serious reaction to the medication. Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms that may occur during the infusion: chills or shaking, itching, rash, flushing, difficulty breathing, dizziness, fever, and feeling faint. Your doctor may slow down your infusion, delay it, or stop your treatment with nivolumab injection, or treat you with additional medications depending on your response to the medication and any side effects that you experience. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with nivolumab injection. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</Answer>
