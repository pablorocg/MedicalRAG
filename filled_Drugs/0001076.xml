			<Answer>You may experience a serious reaction while you receive or within 24 hours after receiving a dose of a rituximab injection product. These reactions usually happen during the first dose of a rituximab injection product and may cause death. You will receive each dose of a rituximab injection product in a medical facility, and a doctor or nurse will monitor you carefully while you are receiving the medication. You will receive certain medications to help prevent an allergic reaction before you receive each dose of a rituximab injection product. Tell your doctor if you have ever had a reaction to a rituximab product or if you have or have ever had an irregular heartbeat, chest pain, other heart problems, or lung problems. If you experience any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately: hives; rash; itching; swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat; difficulty breathing or swallowing; dizziness; fainting; shortness of breath, wheezing; headache; pounding or irregular heartbeat; fast or weak pulse; pale or bluish skin; pain in the chest that may spread to other parts of the upper body; weakness; or heavy sweating.

You may already be infected with hepatitis B (a virus that infects the liver and may cause severe liver damage) but not have any symptoms of the disease. In this case, receiving a rituximab injection product may increase the risk that your infection will become more serious or life-threatening and you will develop symptoms. Tell your doctor if you have or ever had a severe infection, including hepatitis B virus infection. Your doctor will order a blood test to see if you have an inactive hepatitis B infection. If necessary, your doctor may give you medication to treat this infection before and during your treatment with a rituximab injection product. Your doctor will also monitor you for signs of hepatitis B infection during and for several months after your treatment. If you experience any of the following symptoms during or after your treatment, call your doctor immediately: excessive tiredness, yellowing of the skin or eyes, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, muscle aches, stomach pain, or dark urine.

If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: new or sudden changes in thinking or confusion; difficulty talking or walking; loss of balance; loss of strength; new or sudden changes in vision; or any other unusual symptoms that develop suddenly. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your body's response to a rituximab injection product. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with rituximab injection and each time you receive the medication.

			<Question qid="0001076-3" qtype="usage">How should Rituximab Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rituximab injection products come as a solution (liquid) to be injected into a vein. Rituximab injection products are administered by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or infusion center. Your dosing schedule will depend on the condition that you have, the other medications you are using, and how well your body responds to treatment. Rituximab injection products must be given slowly into a vein. It may take several hours or longer to receive your first dose of a rituximab injection product, so you should plan to spend most of the day at the medical office or infusion center. After the first dose, you may receive a rituximab injection product more quickly, depending on how you respond to treatment. You may experience symptoms such as fever, shaking chills, joint pain, tiredness, headache, or nausea while you are receiving a dose of a rituximab product, especially the first dose. Tell your doctor or other healthcare provider if you experience these symptoms while you are receiving your medication. Your doctor may prescribe other medications to help prevent or relieve these symptoms. Your doctor will tell you to take these medications before you receive each dose of a rituximab product. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>
