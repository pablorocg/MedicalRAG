			<Question qid="0001207-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Ticlopidine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ticlopidine may cause a decrease in white blood cells, which fight infection in the body. If you have fever, chills, sore throat, or other signs of an infection, call your doctor immediately. Ticlopidine may also cause a potentially life-threatening decrease in platelets, which may occur as part of a syndrome that includes injury to red blood cells, causing anemia, kidney abnormalities, neurologic changes, and fever. This condition is called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Call your doctor immediately if you have yellowing of the skin or eyes, pinpoint dots (rash) on the skin, pale color, fever, difficulty speaking, seizures, weakness on a side of the body, or dark urine. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order lab tests, especially during the first 3 months of treatment, to check your response to ticlopidine.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001207-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Ticlopidine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001207-11" qtype="other information">What other information should I know about Ticlopidine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ticlopidine prevents blood from clotting so it may take longer than usual for you to stop bleeding if you are cut or injured. Avoid activities that have a high risk of causing injury. Call your doctor if bleeding is unusual. Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.</Answer>
