			<Question qid="0000444-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Erythromycin and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Erythromycin is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria, such as infections of the respiratory tract, including bronchitis, pneumonia, Legionnaires' disease (a type of lung infection), and pertussis (whooping cough; a serious infection that can cause severe coughing); diphtheria (a serious infection in the throat); sexually transmitted diseases (STD), including syphilis; and ear, intestine, gynecological, urinary tract, and skin infections. It also is used to prevent recurrent rheumatic fever. Erythromycin is in a class of medications called macrolide antibiotics. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics such as erythromycin will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000444-2" qtype="usage">How should Erythromycin be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Erythromycin comes as a capsule, tablet, delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent break-down of the medication by stomach acids) capsule, delayed-release tablet, and an oral suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It usually is taken with or without food every 6 hours (four times a day), every 8 hours (three times a day), or every 12 hours (twice a day). Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take erythromycin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly. If you are taking the suspension, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use the measuring spoon, dropper, or cup that came with the medication or use a spoon made especially for measuring medication. Swallow the capsules and tablets whole with a full glass of water; do not chew or crush them. Continue to take erythromycin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking erythromycin without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000444-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Erythromycin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
