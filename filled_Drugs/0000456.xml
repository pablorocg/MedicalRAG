			<Question qid="0000456-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Estrogen and Bazedoxifene ?</Question>
			<Answer>Taking estrogen increases the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus [womb]) during your treatment or up to 15 years after your treatment, if you have not had a hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus [womb]). The longer you take estrogen, the greater the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer. Taking bazedoxifene along with estrogen may decrease the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer. Do not take any other medications that contain estrogen during your treatment because this may increase the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer. Before you begin taking estrogen, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had cancer and if you have unusual vaginal bleeding. Your doctor may tell you not to take estrogen and bazedoxifene if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding. Your doctor will monitor you closely because of the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer during or after your treatment. Call your doctor immediately if you have any abnormal or unusual vaginal bleeding during your treatment with estrogen. In a large study, women who take estrogen had a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots in the lungs or legs, breast cancer, and dementia (loss of ability to think, learn, and understand) than women who do not take estrogen. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had blood clots or breast cancer, if you have had a heart attack or a stroke, or if you have any condition that increases the risk that you will develop blood clots. Your doctor may tell you not to take estrogen and bazedoxifene. Also tell your doctor if you smoke or use tobacco, and if you have or have ever had high blood pressure, high blood levels of cholesterol or fats, diabetes, heart disease, lupus (a condition in which the body attacks its own tissues causing damage and swelling), breast lumps, or an abnormal mammogram (x-ray of the breast used to find breast cancer). The following symptoms can be signs of the serious health conditions listed above. Call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms while you are taking estrogen and bazedoxifene: sudden, severe headache; sudden, severe vomiting; speech problems; dizziness or faintness; sudden complete or partial loss of vision; double vision; weakness or numbness of an arm or a leg; crushing chest pain or chest heaviness; coughing up blood; sudden shortness of breath; difficulty thinking clearly, remembering, or learning new things; breast lumps or other breast changes; discharge from nipples; or pain, tenderness, or redness in one leg. You should examine your breasts every month and have a mammogram and a breast exam performed by a doctor every year to help detect breast cancer as early as possible. Your doctor will tell you how to properly examine your breasts and whether you should have these exams more often than once a year because of your personal or family medical history. Tell your doctor if you are having surgery or will be on bed rest. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking estrogen and bazedoxifene 4 to 6 weeks before the surgery or bed rest to decrease the risk that you will develop blood clots. If you will be traveling, be sure to get up and move around from time to time because sitting still for too long may increase the risk that you will develop blood clots. You can take steps to decrease the risk that you will develop a serious health problem while you are taking estrogen. Estrogen and bazedoxifene should not be used to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia. Taking the lowest dose of estrogen that controls your symptoms and only taking estrogen as long as needed can help reduce these risks. Talk to your doctor from time to time to decide if you should take a lower dose of estrogen or should stop taking the medication. Talk to your doctor regularly about the risks of taking estrogen and bazedoxifene.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000456-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Estrogen and Bazedoxifene and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Estrogen and bazedoxifene tablets are used to treat hot flashes (sudden feelings of warmth, especially in the face, neck, and chest) in women who are experiencing menopause (stage of life when menstrual periods become less frequent and stop and women may experience other symptoms and body changes). Estrogen and bazedoxifene tablets are also used to prevent osteoporosis (condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) in women who have undergone menopause. Estrogen is in a class of medications called hormones and bazedoxifene is in a class of medications called estrogen agonist&#8211;antagonists. Estrogen works by replacing estrogen that is normally produced by the body. Bazedoxifene is used to block the action of estrogen on the lining of the uterus, decreasing the risk of overgrowth that may lead to cancer.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000456-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Estrogen and Bazedoxifene ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the foil pouch and blister pack it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). If you receive more than one foil pouch of medication, do not open the second pouch until you use all of the medication in the first pouch. Mark down the date that you open a foil pouch and dispose of any unused medication in the pouch 60 days after you open it. Do not remove tablets from the blister pack until you are ready to take them. Do not store tablets in a pillbox or pill-organizer. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.

To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
