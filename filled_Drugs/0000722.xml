			<Question qid="0000722-2" qtype="usage">How should Lorazepam be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lorazepam comes as a tablet, an extended release capsule (Loreev), and concentrate (liquid) to take by mouth with or without food. The tablets and concentrate (liquid) are usually taken with or without food two or three times a day. If lorazepam (tablets or concentrate) is used to treat insomnia, it is usually taken at bedtime. The extended release capsules (Loreev) are usually taken with or without food once a day in the morning. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take lorazepam exactly as directed. Swallow the extended release capsules whole; do not chew or crush them. If you are unable to swallow the extended release capsule, you may open the capsule and sprinkle the entire contents onto a tablespoon of applesauce. You may prepare the mixture in advance and store it for up to 2 hours. When you are ready to take your medication, swallow all the mixture without chewing. Then drink water to wash down the mixture and be sure that you have swallowed all of it. Do not store the medication mixture for future use. Lorazepam concentrate (liquid) comes with a specially marked dropper for measuring the dose. Ask your pharmacist to show you how to use the dropper. Dilute the concentrate in water, juice, or carbonated beverages just before taking it. It also may be mixed with applesauce or pudding just before taking the dose. Stir the mixture gently for a few seconds. Take the entire mixture immediately; do not store it for future use.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000722-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Lorazepam ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
