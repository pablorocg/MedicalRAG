			<Question qid="0000778-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Methyclothiazide and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Methyclothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure. Methyclothiazide is also used to treat edema (fluid retention; excess fluid held in body tissues) caused by various medical problems, including heart, kidney, and liver disease and to treat edema caused by using certain medications including estrogen and corticosteroids. Methyclothiazide is in a class of medications called diuretics ('water pills'). It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine. High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000778-2" qtype="usage">How should Methyclothiazide be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Methyclothiazide comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day in the morning. Take methyclothiazide around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take methyclothiazide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Methyclothiazide controls high blood pressure and edema but does not cure these conditions. Continue to take methyclothiazide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking methyclothiazide without talking to your doctor.</Answer>
