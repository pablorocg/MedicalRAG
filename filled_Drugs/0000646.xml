			<Question qid="0000646-2" qtype="usage">How should Isoetharine Oral Inhalation be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Isoetharine comes as an aerosol and a solution to inhale by mouth. It is used as needed to relieve symptoms but usually should not be used more than every 4 hours. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use isoetharine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Isoetharine controls symptoms of asthma and other lung diseases but does not cure them. Do not stop using isoetharine without talking to your doctor. Before you use isoetharine the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to demonstrate the proper technique. Practice using the inhaler while in his or her presence. To use the inhaler, follow these steps:
 Shake the inhaler well., Remove the protective cap., Exhale (breathe out) as completely as possible through your nose while keeping your mouth shut.,  Open Mouth Technique:  Open your mouth wide, and place the open end of the mouthpiece about 1 to 2 inches from your mouth. Closed Mouth Technique:  Place the open end of the mouthpiece well into your mouth, past your front teeth. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece., Take a slow, deep breath through the mouthpiece and, at the same time, press down on the container to spray the medication into your mouth. Be sure that the mist goes into your throat and is not blocked by your teeth or tongue. Adults giving the treatment to young children may hold the child's nose closed to be sure that the medication goes into the child's throat., Hold your breath for 5-10 seconds, remove the inhaler, and exhale slowly through your nose or mouth. If you take 2 puffs, wait 2 minutes and shake the inhaler well before taking the second puff., Replace the protective cap on the inhaler.,  If you have difficulty getting the medication into your lungs, a spacer (a special device that attaches to the inhaler) may help; ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000646-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Isoetharine Oral Inhalation ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not use the liquid if it is pink, yellow, or dark in color or if it contains floating particles. Avoid puncturing the aerosol container, and do not discard it in an incinerator or fire. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000646-7" qtype="other information">What other information should I know about Isoetharine Oral Inhalation ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your response to isoetharine. To relieve dry mouth or throat irritation, rinse your mouth with water, chew gum, or suck sugarless hard candy after using isoetharine. Inhalation devices require regular cleaning. Once a week, remove the drug container from the plastic mouthpiece, wash the mouthpiece with warm tap water, and dry it thoroughly. Do not let any one else use your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.</Answer>
