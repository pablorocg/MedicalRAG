			<Question qid="0000315-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Dalfampridine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dalfampridine is used to improve walking in people who have multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and may cause weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination, and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control). Dalfampridine may be used alone or with other medications that control the symptoms of MS. Dalfampridine is in a class of medications called potassium channel blockers. It works by strengthening the signals sent by the brain through nerves that have been damaged by MS.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000315-2" qtype="usage">How should Dalfampridine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dalfampridine comes as an extended-release tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food twice a day. Space your doses so that you take one dose approximately every 12 hours, and take dalfampridine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take dalfampridine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, dissolve, or crush them. Dalfampridine is not available in pharmacies. You can only get dalfampridine through the mail from a specialty pharmacy. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about receiving your medication. Dalfampridine may help improve your walking only as long as you continue to take it. It may take 6 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of dalfampridine. Continue to take dalfampridine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking dalfampridine without talking to your doctor. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with dalfampridine and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000315-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Dalfampridine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
