			<Question qid="0001135-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Stavudine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Stavudine may cause serious or life-threatening lactic acidosis (build-up of acid in the blood) that will probably need to be treated in the hospital. The risk that you will develop lactic acidosis is higher if you are a woman, if you are overweight, and if you have been treated with medications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for a long time. The risk may also be higher if you are pregnant and you are taking stavudine along with didanosine (Videx). Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease, including hepatitis C virus infection. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: nausea; vomiting; loss of appetite; excessive tiredness; weakness; dizziness; lightheadedness; fast or irregular heartbeat; trouble breathing; dark yellow or brown urine; unusual bleeding or bruising; flu-like symptoms; light-colored bowel movements; yellowing of the skin or eyes; pain in the upper right part of your stomach; feeling cold, especially in the arms or legs; or muscle pain that is different than any muscle pain you usually experience. Stavudine may cause serious or life-threatening pancreatitis (swelling of the pancreas). Tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcoholic beverages and if you have or have ever had pancreatitis. Do not drink alcohol while you are taking stavudine. Also tell your doctor if you are taking didanosine (Videx). If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: stomach pain or swelling, nausea, vomiting, or fever. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests to check your body's response to stavudine.

			<Question qid="0001135-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Stavudine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Stavudine is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Stavudine is in a class of medications called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although stavudine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001135-3" qtype="usage">How should Stavudine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Stavudine comes as a capsule and as an oral solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day (every 12 hours), with or without food and with plenty of water. To help you remember to take stavudine, take it at around the same times each day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take stavudine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you are giving the oral solution to a child, shake the bottle well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the measuring cup provided to measure the child's dose. Stavudine controls HIV infection but does not cure it. Continue to take stavudine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking stavudine without talking to your doctor. When your supply of stavudine starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. If you miss doses or suddenly stop taking stavudine, your condition may become more difficult to treat.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001135-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Stavudine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store the capsules at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Store the oral solution in the refrigerator and dispose of the unused portion after 30 days. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
