			<Question qid="0000882-2" qtype="usage">How should Nystatin be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nystatin comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. For the treatment of fungal infections of the lining of the stomach and intestines, nystatin tablets are usually taken three times a day. For the treatment of fungal infections of the mouth, nystatin suspension is usually used four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nystatin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Place half of the dose in each side of the mouth and hold it there as long as possible before swallowing. Use nystatin as long as instructed by your doctor, even if you feel better. If you stop using nystatin too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000882-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Nystatin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not allow nystatin to freeze. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000882-7" qtype="other information">What other information should I know about Nystatin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain lab tests to check your response to nystatin. Do not let anyone else use your medication. Your prescription is probably not refillable. If you still have symptoms of infection after you finish the nystatin, call your doctor. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.</Answer>
