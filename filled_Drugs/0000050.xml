If you are a woman and able to become pregnant, you should not begin taking ambrisentan until a pregnancy test has shown that you are not pregnant.

Talk to your doctor about birth control methods that will work for you. Call your doctor immediately if you miss a menstrual period or think you may be pregnant while you are taking ambrisentan. Because of the risk of birth defects, ambrisentan is available to females only through a special restricted distribution program. A program called Ambrisentan REMS ( Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) has been set up to make sure that female patient have appropriate lab tests before and while they are receiving ambrisentan. Women can get ambrisentan only if they are registered with this program. Your doctor must enroll you in this program. You can only receive the medication from a pharmacy that participates in the program. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about participating in the program or how to get your medication.

			<Question qid="0000050-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Ambrisentan and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ambrisentan is used alone or in combination with tadalafil (Adcirca, Cialis) to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, high blood pressure in the vessels that carry blood to the lungs). Ambrisentan may improve the ability to exercise and slow the worsening of symptoms in people with PAH. Ambrisentan is in a class of medications called endothelin receptor antagonists. It works by stopping the action of endothelin, a natural substance that causes blood vessels to narrow and prevents normal blood flow in people who have PAH.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000050-3" qtype="usage">How should Ambrisentan be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ambrisentan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day. Take ambrisentan at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ambrisentan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of ambrisentan and gradually increase your dose. Ambrisentan controls the symptoms of PAH but does not cure it. Continue to take ambrisentan even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ambrisentan without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking ambrisentan, your condition may worsen.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000050-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Ambrisentan ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
