			<Question qid="0000509-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Flunisolide Nasal Spray and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Flunisolide nasal spray is used to relieve symptoms of sneezing, runny, stuffy, or itchy nose caused by hay fever or other allergies. Flunisolide nasal spray should not be used to treat symptoms (e.g., sneezing, stuffy, runny, itchy nose) caused by the common cold. It is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by blocking the release of certain natural substances that cause allergy symptoms.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000509-2" qtype="usage">How should Flunisolide Nasal Spray be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Flunisolide comes as a solution (liquid) to spray in the nose. It is usually sprayed in each nostril 2 to 3 times a day but may be used less frequently after your symptoms are controlled.. Use flunisolide at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use flunisolide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. An adult should help children younger than 12 years old to use flunisolide nasal spray. Children younger than 6 years of age should not use this medication. Flunisolide nasal spray is only for use in the nose. Do not swallow the nasal spray and be careful not to spray it into your mouth or eyes. Each bottle of flunisolide nasal spray should only be used by one person. Do not share flunisolide nasal spray because this may spread germs.

			<Question qid="0000509-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Flunisolide Nasal Spray ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000509-8" qtype="other information">What other information should I know about Flunisolide Nasal Spray ?</Question>

You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.</Answer>
