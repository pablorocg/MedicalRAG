			<Question qid="0000623-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Insulin Detemir (rDNA Origin) Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Insulin detemir is used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). It is also used to treat people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) who need insulin to control their diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin detemir may be used with another type of insulin (a short-acting insulin). In patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin detemir also may be used with another type of insulin or with oral medication(s) for diabetes. Insulin detemir is a long-acting, man-made version of human insulin. Insulin detemir works by replacing the insulin that is normally produced by the body and by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar. Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000623-2" qtype="usage">How should Insulin Detemir (rDNA Origin) Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Insulin detemir comes as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually injected once a day, with the evening meal or at bedtime.Sometimes insulin detemir may be injected twice a day, in the morning before breakfast and in the evening with the evening meal or at bedtime about 12 hours later. Inject insulin detemir at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use insulin detemir exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Never use insulin detemir when you have symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or if you have checked your blood sugar and found it to be low. Do not inject insulin into a skin area that is red, swollen, itchy, or thickened. Insulin detemir should not be used in an external insulin pump. Insulin detemir should not be diluted or mixed with other insulin products. Insulin detemir controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to use insulin detemir even if you feel well. Do not stop using insulin detemir without talking to your doctor. Do not switch to another brand or type of insulin or change the dose of any type of insulin you are using without talking to your doctor. Insulin detemir comes in vials and in dosing pens that contain cartridges of medication. Be sure you know what type of container your insulin detemir comes in and what other supplies, such as needles, syringes, or pens, you will need to inject your medication. If your insulin detemir comes in vials, you will need to use syringes to inject your dose. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to inject insulin detemir using a syringe. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the type of syringe you should use. If your insulin detemir comes in pens, be sure to read and understand the manufacturer's instructions. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use the pen. Follow the directions carefully, and always prime the pen before use. Never reuse needles or syringes and never share needles, syringes, or pens. If you are using an insulin pen, always remove the needle right after you inject your dose. Dispose of needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container. Always look at your insulin detemir before you inject it. It should be clear and colorless. Do not use your insulin detemir if it is colored, cloudy, thickened, or contains solid particles, or if the expiration date on the bottle has passed. You can inject your insulin detemir in your upper arm, thigh, or stomach. Never inject insulin detemir into a vein or muscle. Change (rotate) the injection site within the chosen area with each dose; try to avoid injecting the same site more often than once every 1&#8211;2 weeks. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000623-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Insulin Detemir (rDNA Origin) Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Store unopened insulin detemir vials and pens in the original carton in the refrigerator. Do not freeze. Do not use insulin detemir if it has been frozen. Unopened refrigerated insulin detemir can be stored until the date shown on the company's label. If no refrigerator is available (for example, when on vacation), store the vials, or pens at room temperature and away from direct heat and light. Unrefrigerated vials and pens can be used within 42 days or after that time they must be discarded. Opened vials can be stored for 42 days at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Opened pens may be stored at room temperature for up to 42 days; do not refrigerate them. Discard any insulin detemir that has been exposed to extreme heat or cold. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
