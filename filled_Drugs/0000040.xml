			<Question qid="0000040-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Almotriptan and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Almotriptan is used to treat the symptoms of migraine headaches (severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound and light). Almotriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels around the brain, stopping pain signals from being sent to the brain, and blocking the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms of migraine. Almotriptan does not prevent migraine attacks or reduce the number of headaches you have.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000040-2" qtype="usage">How should Almotriptan be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Almotriptan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken at the first sign of a migraine headache. If your symptoms improve after you take almotriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may take a second tablet. However, if your symptoms do not improve after you take almotriptan, do not take a second tablet before calling your doctor. Your doctor will tell you the maximum number of tablets you may take in a 24-hour period. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take almotriptan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You may take your first dose of almotriptan in a doctor's office or other medical facility where you can be monitored for serious reactions. Call your doctor if your headaches do not get better or occur more frequently after taking almotriptan. If you take almotriptan more often or for longer than the recommended period of time, your headaches may get worse or may occur more frequently. You should not take almotriptan or any other headache medication for more than 10 days per month. Call your doctor if you need to take almotriptan to treat more than four headaches in a 1-month period. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000040-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Almotriptan ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
