			<Question qid="0000770-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Methamphetamine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Methamphetamine can be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor. Methamphetamine should only be taken for a short period (e.g., a few weeks) when used for weight loss. However, if you take too much methamphetamine you may find that the medication no longer controls your symptoms, you may feel a need to take large amounts of the medication, and you may experience symptoms such as rash, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, irritability, hyperactivity, and unusual changes in your personality or behavior. Overusing methamphetamine may also cause serious heart problems or sudden death. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family drinks or has ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, uses or has ever used street drugs, or has overused prescription medications. Your doctor will probably not prescribe methamphetamine for you. Do not stop taking methamphetamine without talking to your doctor, especially if you have overused the medication. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually and monitor you carefully during this time. You may experience depression and extreme tiredness if you suddenly stop taking methamphetamine after overusing it. Do not sell, give away, or let anyone else take your medication. Selling or giving away methamphetamine is against the law and may harm others. Store methamphetamine in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Keep track of how many tablets are left so you will know if any are missing. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with methamphetamine and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000770-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Methamphetamine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Methamphetamine is used as part of a treatment program to control symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; more difficulty focusing, controlling actions, and remaining still or quiet than other people who are the same age) in children. Methamphetamine is also used for a limited period of time (a few weeks) along with a reduced calorie diet and an exercise plan for weight loss in obese people unable to lose weight. Methamphetamine is in a class of medications called central nervous system stimulants. It works by changing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000770-3" qtype="usage">How should Methamphetamine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Methamphetamine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. If your child is taking methamphetamine for ADHD, it is usually taken one or two times daily. If you are taking methamphetamine for weight management, it is usually taken 30 minutes before meal(s). This medication may cause difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep if it is taken in the evening. Take methamphetamine at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take methamphetamine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If your child is taking methamphetamine for ADHD, the doctor will probably start the child on a low dose and gradually increase the dose, not more often than once every week. The doctor may stop methamphetamine treatment from time to time to see if the medication is still needed. Follow these directions carefully. If you are taking methamphetamine to lose weight, the doctor will maintain you on the lowest dose possible. Tolerance to the weight loss effect may develop within a few weeks, making this medication less effective. When this occurs, the doctor may stop the medication. Methamphetamine helps to control ADHD but does not cure this condition. Continue to take methamphetamine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking methamphetamine without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000770-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Methamphetamine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
