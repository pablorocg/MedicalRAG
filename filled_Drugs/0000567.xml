			<Question qid="0000567-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Guanabenz and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Guanabenz is used to treat high blood pressure. It is in a class of medications called centrally acting alpha 2A -adrenergic receptor agonists. Guanabenz works by decreasing your heart rate and relaxing the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily through the body. High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000567-2" qtype="usage">How should Guanabenz be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Guanabenz comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken twice a day at evenly spaced intervals. Take guanabenz at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take guanabenz exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Guanabenz controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take guanabenz even if you feel well. Do not stop taking guanabenz without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking guanabenz you may develop high blood pressure and experience unwanted side effects.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000567-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Guanabenz ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000567-10" qtype="other information">What other information should I know about Guanabenz ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your blood pressure should be checked regularly to determine your response to guanabenz. Your doctor may ask you to check your pulse (heart rate) daily and will tell you how rapid it should be. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to teach you how to take your pulse. If your pulse is slower or faster than it should be, call your doctor before taking the medication that day. To avoid dizziness or faintness, get up slowly from a sitting or lying position. If you feel dizzy or faint at any time, you should lie or sit down. To relieve dry mouth caused by guanabenz, chew gum or suck sugarless hard candy. Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.</Answer>
