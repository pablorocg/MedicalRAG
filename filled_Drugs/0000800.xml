			<Question qid="0000800-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Mifepristone (Mifeprex) ?</Question>
			<Answer>Serious or life-threatening vaginal bleeding may occur when a pregnancy is ended by miscarriage or by medical or surgical abortion. It is not known if taking mifepristone increases the risk that you will experience very heavy bleeding. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had bleeding problems or anemia (less than normal number of red blood cells). Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking medications that may cause bleeding including anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven); heparin; or other medications to treat or prevent blood clots. If so, your doctor will probably tell you not to take mifepristone. If you experience very heavy vaginal bleeding, such as soaking through two thick full-size sanitary pads every hour for two continuous hours, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care. Serious or life threatening infections may occur when a pregnancy is ended by miscarriage or by medical or surgical abortion. A small number of patients died due to infections that they developed after they used mifepristone and misoprostol to end their pregnancies. It is not known if mifepristone and/or misoprostol caused these infections or deaths. If you develop a serious infection, you may not have many symptoms and your symptoms may not be very severe. You should call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment if you experience any of the following symptoms: fever greater than 100.4 &#176;F (38 &#176;C) that lasts for more than 4 hours, severe pain or tenderness in the area below the waist, chills, fast heartbeat, or fainting. You should also call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment if you have general symptoms of illness such as weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or feeling sick for more than 24 hours after taking mifepristone even if you do not have a fever or pain in the area below your waist. Because of the risks of serious complications, mifepristone is available only through a restricted program. A program under called the mifepristone Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) Program has been set up for all female patients who are prescribed mifepristone. Your doctor will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) to read before you begin treatment with mifepristone. You can only receive the medication from a doctor or a pharmacy that participates in the program. You will also need to sign a patient agreement before taking mifepristone. Tell your doctor if you have questions about treatment with mifepristone or if you cannot follow the guidelines in the patient agreement. Talk to your doctor and decide whom to call and what to do in case of an emergency after taking mifepristone. Tell your doctor if you do not think that you will be able to follow this plan or to get medical treatment quickly in an emergency during the first two weeks after you take mifepristone. Keep all appointments with your doctor. These appointments are necessary to be sure that your pregnancy has ended and that you have not developed serious complications of medical abortion. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking mifepristone.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000800-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Mifepristone (Mifeprex) and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Mifepristone is used in combination with misoprostol (Cytotec) to end an early pregnancy. Early pregnancy means it has been 70 days or less since your last menstrual period began. Mifepristone is in a class of medications called antiprogestational steroids. It works by blocking the activity of progesterone, a substance your body makes to help continue pregnancy. Mifepristone is also available as another product (Korlym), which is used to control hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) in people with a certain type of Cushing's Syndrome in which the body makes too much of the hormone cortisol. This monograph only gives information about mifepristone (Mifeprex), which is used alone or in combination with another medication to end an early pregnancy. If you are using mifepristone to control hyperglycemia caused by Cushing's syndrome, read the monograph entitled mifepristone (Korlym) that has been written about this product.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000800-3" qtype="usage">How should Mifepristone (Mifeprex) be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Mifepristone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. You will take one tablet of mifepristone once on the first day. Within 24 to 48 hours after taking mifepristone, you will apply four tablets in total of another medication called misoprostol buccally (between the gum and cheek) by placing two tablets in each cheek pouch for 30 minutes, then swallowing the remaining content with water or another liquid. Make sure that you are in an appropriate location when you take misoprostol because vaginal bleeding, cramps, nausea, and diarrhea usually begins within 2 to 24 hours after taking it but could begin within 2 hours. Vaginal bleeding or spotting usually lasts for 9 to 16 days but can last for 30 days or longer. You must go back to your doctor for an exam or ultrasound 7 to 14 days after taking mifepristone to confirm that the pregnancy has ended and to check the amount of bleeding. Take mifepristone exactly as directed.</Answer>
