			<Question qid="0001304-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Zileuton and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Zileuton is used to prevent wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness due to asthma. Zileuton is not used to treat an asthma attack (sudden episode of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) that has already started. Zileuton belongs to a class of medications called leukotriene synthesis inhibitors. It works by stopping the formation of certain natural substances that cause swelling, tightening, and mucus production in the airways.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001304-2" qtype="usage">How should Zileuton be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Zileuton comes as a tablet and an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The tablet is usually taken four times a day with or without food. The extended-release tablet is usually taken twice a day, within one hour after the morning and evening meals. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take zileuton exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the extended-release tablets whole. Do not split, chew, or crush them. Do not use zileuton to treat a sudden asthma attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during attacks. Talk to your doctor about how to treat symptoms of a sudden asthma attack. Continue to take all other medications that your doctor has prescribed to treat your asthma. Do not stop taking any of your medications or change the doses of any of your medications unless your doctor tells you that you should. Tell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment. Call your doctor if you need to use more of your fast-acting medication than usual or if you need to use the maximum number of doses of your fast-acting medication. Zileuton helps control asthma symptoms but does not cure asthma. It may take several days or longer before you feel the full benefit of zileuton. Continue to take zileuton even if you feel well. Do not stop taking zileuton without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001304-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Zileuton ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
