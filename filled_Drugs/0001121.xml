			<Question qid="0001121-2" qtype="usage">How should Sodium Ferric Gluconate Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>

Sodium ferric gluconate injection is usually given during 8 consecutive dialysis sessions for a total of 8 doses. If your iron levels become low after you finish your treatment, your doctor may prescribe this medication again. Sodium ferric gluconate injection may cause severe or life-threatening reactions during and shortly after you receive the medication. Your doctor will watch you carefully while you receive each dose of sodium ferric gluconate injection and for at least 30 minutes afterwards. Tell your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms during or after your injection: shortness of breath; wheezing; difficulty swallowing or breathing; hoarseness; facial flushing; swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, or eyes; hives; rash; itching; fainting; lightheadedness; dizziness; weakness; severe pain in the chest, back, thighs, or groin; sweating; cold, clammy skin; rapid, weak pulse; slow heartbeat; or loss of consciousness.
