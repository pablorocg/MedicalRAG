			<Question qid="0000723-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Lorcaserin and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lorcaserin is used to help adults who are obese or who are overweight and have weight-related medical problems to lose weight and keep from gaining back that weight. Lorcaserin must be used along with a reduced calorie diet and an exercise plan. Lorcaserin is in a class of medications called serotonin receptor agonists. It works by increasing feelings of fullness so that less food is eaten.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000723-2" qtype="usage">How should Lorcaserin be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lorcaserin comes as a tablet and as an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The tablets are usually taken with or without food twice a day. The extended-release tablets are usually taken with or without food once a day. Take lorcaserin at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take lorcaserin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Lorcaserin may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor. If you do not lose a certain amount of weight during the first 12 weeks of your treatment, it is not likely that you will benefit from taking lorcaserin. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking lorcaserin if you do not lose enough weight during the first 12 weeks of your treatment. Lorcaserin will help control your weight only if you continue to take it. Do not stop taking lorcaserin without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000723-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Lorcaserin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
