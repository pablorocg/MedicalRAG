			<Question qid="0000793-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Metronidazole Oral and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Metronidazole is used to treat infections of the reproductive system, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, skin, heart, bone, joint, lung, blood, nervous system, and other areas of the body. It is also used to treat certain sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Metronidazole is also used to treat bacterial vaginosis (an infection caused by too much of certain types of harmful bacteria in the vagina) in women. Metronidazole is in a class of medications called nitroimidazole antimicrobials. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000793-3" qtype="usage">How should Metronidazole Oral be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Metronidazole comes as a tablet, a capsule, and suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. Metronidazole tablets and suspension are usually taken as a one-time dose (or divided into two doses on 1 day) or two to four times daily for up to 10 days or longer. Metronidazole capsules are usually taken two to four times daily for up to 10 days or longer. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take metronidazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Shake the oral suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use a dosing spoon, oral syringe, or measuring cup to measure the correct amount of medication. You may not receive the correct amount of medication if you use a household spoon to measure your dose. Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Continue to take this medication even if you feel well. Do not stop taking it without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking this medication too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000793-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Metronidazole Oral ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
