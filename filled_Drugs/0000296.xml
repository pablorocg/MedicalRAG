			<Question qid="0000296-2" qtype="usage">How should Cromolyn Sodium Nasal Solution be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cromolyn comes as a solution to use with a special nasal applicator. It usually is inhaled three to six times a day to prevent allergy symptoms. It is most effective when used before you come in contact with substances that cause allergies. If you have seasonal allergies, continue to use the drug until the season is over. Follow the directions on the package or your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use cromolyn exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed or prescribed by your doctor. It may take up to 4 weeks for cromolyn to work. If your symptoms have not improved after 4 weeks, tell your doctor. Cromolyn is used with a special applicator (Nasalmatic). Before you use cromolyn for the first time, read the instructions provided with the solution. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to demonstrate the proper technique. Practice using the device while in his or her presence. If you are to use the nasal spray, first blow your nose, and clear it as much as possible. Insert the applicator into a nostril. Sniff as you squeeze the sprayer once. To prevent mucous from entering the sprayer, do not release your grip until after you remove the sprayer from your nose. Repeat this process for your other nostril.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000296-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Cromolyn Sodium Nasal Solution ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
