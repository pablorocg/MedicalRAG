			<Question qid="0001180-2" qtype="usage">How should Terbinafine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Terbinafine comes as granules and as a tablet to take by mouth. Terbinafine granules are usually taken with a soft food once a day for 6 weeks. Terbinafine tablets are usually taken with or without food once a day for 6 weeks for fingernail infections and once a day for 12 weeks for toenail infections. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take terbinafine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. To prepare a dose of terbinafine granules, sprinkle the entire packet of granules onto a spoonful of soft food such as pudding or mashed potatoes. Do not sprinkle the granules onto a fruit-based soft food, such as applesauce. If your doctor has told you to take 2 packets of terbinafine granules, you may sprinkle the contents of both packets onto one spoonful, or you may sprinkle each packet onto a separate spoonful of soft food. Swallow the spoonful of granules and soft food without chewing. Your fungus may not be completely cured until a few months after you finish taking terbinafine. This is because it takes time for a healthy nail to grow in. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with terbinafine and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001180-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Terbinafine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Store terbinafine tablets away from light. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
