			<Question qid="0000377-2" qtype="usage">How should Diphenhydramine Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Diphenhydramine topical comes in cream, lotion, gel, and spray to be applied to the skin. It is used three or four times a day. Follow the directions on the package or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use diphenhydramine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed by your doctor. Thoroughly clean the affected area, allow it to dry, and then gently rub the medication in until most of it disappears. Use just enough medication to cover the affected area. You should wash your hands after applying the medication. Do not apply diphenhydramine on chicken pox or measles, and do not use it on a child younger than 2 years of age unless directed to do so by a doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000377-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Diphenhydramine Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). The spray is flammable. Keep it away from flames and extreme heat. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
