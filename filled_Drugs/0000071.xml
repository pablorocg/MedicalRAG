			<Question qid="0000071-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Ampicillin Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ampicillin injection is used to treat certain infections that are caused by bacteria such as meningitis (infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) and lung, blood, heart, urinary tract, and gastrointestinal tract infections. Ampicillin injection is in a class of medications called penicillins. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as ampicillin injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000071-2" qtype="usage">How should Ampicillin Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ampicillin injection comes as a powder to be mixed with fluid and injected intravenously (into a vein) or intramuscularly (into a muscle). The frequency and length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have. You may receive ampicillin injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you will be receiving ampicillin injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with ampicillin injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Use ampicillin injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using ampicillin injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>
