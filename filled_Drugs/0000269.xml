			<Question qid="0000269-2" qtype="usage">How should Clindamycin Vaginal be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Vaginal clindamycin comes as a suppository to place in the vagina and a cream to apply to the inside of the vagina. The vaginal suppositories are usually used once a day, preferably at bedtime, for 3 days in a row. Most brands of the vaginal cream are used once a day, preferably at bedtime, for 3 days in a row or for 7 days in a row. One brand of vaginal cream (Clindesse &#174; ) is usually used as a single dose, given at any time of day. If you are using more than one dose of vaginal clindamycin, use it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use vaginal clindamycin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. This medication is for vaginal use only. Do not swallow the cream or suppositories, and do not apply the cream to any other part of your body. Be careful not to get the cream in your eyes. If you do get the cream in your eyes, rinse your eyes with plenty of cool water. Your medication will come with directions for use. Read these directions and follow them carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to use vaginal clindamycin. Use vaginal clindamycin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using vaginal clindamycin too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000269-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Clindamycin Vaginal ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat (above 86 &#176;F) and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
