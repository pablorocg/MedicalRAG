			<Question qid="0000218-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Ceftazidime and Avibactam Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of ceftazidime and avibactam injection is used with metronidazole (Flagyl) to treat abdominal (stomach area) infections. It is also used to treat pneumonia that developed in people who are on ventilators or who were in a hospital, and kidney and urinary tract infections. Ceftazidime is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Avibactam is in a class of medications called beta-lactamase inhibitors. It works by preventing bacteria from breaking down ceftazidime. Antibiotics such as ceftazidime and avibactam will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>
