			<Question qid="0000526-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Fluticasone Nasal Spray and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nonprescription (over the counter) fluticasone nasal spray is used to relieve symptoms of rhinitis such as sneezing and a runny, stuffy, or itchy nose and itchy, watery eyes caused by hay fever or other allergies (caused by an allergy to pollen, mold, dust, or pets). Prescription fluticasone nasal spray is used to relieve symptoms of nonallergic rhinitis such as sneezing and runny or stuffy nose which are not caused by allergies. Prescription fluticasone nasal spray (Xhance) is used to treat nasal polyps (swelling of the lining of the nose). Fluticasone nasal spray should not be used to treat symptoms (e.g., sneezing, stuffy, runny, itchy nose) caused by the common cold. Fluticasone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by blocking the release of certain natural substances that cause allergy symptoms.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000526-2" qtype="usage">How should Fluticasone Nasal Spray be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Fluticasone comes as a (prescription and nonprescription) liquid to spray in the nose. When nonprescription fluticasone nasal spray is used to relieve hay fever and other allergy symptoms, it is usually sprayed in each nostril once daily. When prescription fluticasone nasal spray is used to treat nonallergic rhinitis, it is usually sprayed in each nostril one or two times a day. When prescription fluticasone nasal spray is used to treat nasal polyps, it is usually sprayed in each nostril two times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription or product label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use fluticasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed on the package label or prescribed by your doctor. Fluticasone nasal spray is only for use in the nose. Do not swallow the nasal spray and be careful not to spray it into your eyes or mouth. Each bottle of fluticasone nasal spray should only be used by one person. Do not share fluticasone nasal spray because this may spread germs. Fluticasone nasal spray controls the symptoms of hay fever, allergies, nonallergic rhinitis, or nasal polyps, but does not cure these conditions. Your symptoms may begin to improve 1 to 2 days after you first use fluticasone, but it may take longer before you feel the full benefit of fluticasone nasal spray. Fluticasone works best when used regularly. Use fluticasone on a regular schedule unless your doctor has told you to use it as needed. Call your doctor if your symptoms get worse or do not improve after you use nonprescription fluticasone nasal spray daily for 1 week. Fluticasone nasal spray is designed to provide a certain number of sprays. After the marked number of sprays has been used, the remaining sprays in the bottle might not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of sprays you have used and dispose of the bottle after you have used the marked number of sprays even if it still contains some liquid. Before you use fluticasone nasal spray for the first time, read the written directions that come with it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to use the nasal spray. If you are using fluticasone nasal spray to treat hay fever, other allergy symptoms, or nonallergic rhinitis, follow these steps:
 Shake the bottle gently before each use., Remove the dust cover., If you are using the nasal spray pump for the first time or if you haven't used your nasal spray for a period of time, you must prime the pump. Carefully read the instructions that come with your nasal spray pump, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how and when to prime the nasal spray pump., Blow your nose until your nostrils are clear., Close one nostril by gently placing your finger against the side of your nose, tilt your head slightly forward and, keeping the bottle upright, insert the nasal tip into the other nostril. Begin to breathe in through your nose. While you are breathing, pump the spray bottle to release a spray according to the instructions that come with your nasal spray pump. Breathe gently in through the nostril and breathe out through your mouth., If your doctor told you to use two sprays in each nostril, repeat step 5., Wipe the applicator with a clean tissue and replace the plastic cap on the bottle., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000526-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Fluticasone Nasal Spray ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess light, heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
