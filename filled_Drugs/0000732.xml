			<Question qid="0000732-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Macitentan ?</Question>
			<Answer>For female patients: Do not take macitentan if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. There is a high risk that macitentan will cause harm to the fetus.  Because of the risk of fetal harm, a program called OPSUMIT Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (OPSUMIT REMS) has been set up to make sure that pregnant woman do not take macitentan, and that woman do not become pregnant while taking macitentan. All females, including females who are not able to get pregnant, can only receive macitentan if they are registered with OPSUMIT REMS, have a prescription from a doctor who is registered with OPSUMIT REMS, and fill the prescription at a pharmacy that is registered with OPSUMIT REMS. Your doctor will register you in OPSUMIT REMS. Your doctor will tell you about the risks of macitentan, especially the risks of serious birth defects if taken while pregnant. You must sign an informed consent sheet stating that you understand this information in order for your doctor to register you. Your doctor will also determine if you are able to become pregnant. If you have reached puberty (when child's body becomes physically mature and capable of having a child), have a uterus, and have not yet gone through menopause ('change in life' end of monthly menstrual periods) you are considered to be a female who is able to become pregnant, and you will have to follow certain additional rules in order to receive macitentan. For females who are able to become pregnant: You must use reliable birth control throughout your treatment with macitentan, and for 1 month after your final dose. Your doctor will tell you which forms of birth control are acceptable, and will give your written information about birth control. In most cases you will be required to use two forms of birth control in order to prevent pregnancy while taking macitentan. You will have to take a pregnancy test before starting treatment, every month during treatment, and 1 month after your final dose in order to be able to receive macitentan. Your doctor will order the pregnancy tests for you. The pharmacy will not dispense macitentan to you until they have confirmed that you have taken your required pregnancy tests. You must not have unprotected sex while taking macitentan. Call your doctor right away if you have had unprotected sex, think your birth control failed, missed your period, or think you may be pregnant for any reason. He will discuss your medical options with you. Do not wait until your next appointment to discuss this with your doctor. Tell your doctor if you do not understand everything you were told about birth control, or if you do not think you will be able to use acceptable forms of birth control at all times during your treatment. If you are a parent or guardian of a female who had not yet reached puberty, check your child regularly to see if she is developing any signs of puberty (breast buds, pubic hair )and let her doctor know about any changes. For all patients: Macitentan is not available at retail pharmacies. Your medication will be mailed to you from a specialty pharmacy that is registered with OPSUMIT REMS. If you are a female who has not reached puberty or a female who is able to become pregnant you will only receive a 30 day supply at a time. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how you will receive your medication. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with macitentan and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000732-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Macitentan and why is it prescribed ?</Question>

			<Question qid="0000732-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Macitentan ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
