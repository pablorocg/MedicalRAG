Tell your doctor if you have recently had surgery, or if you have recently been injured in any way. Also, tell your doctor if you have a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia (condition in which the blood does not clot normally). Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medications: anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), aspirin or products containing aspirin, cilostazol, clopidogrel (Plavix), dipyridamole (Persantine, in Aggrenox), eptifibatide (Integrilin), heparin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen), prasugrel (Effient), ticlopidine, or tirofiban (Aggrastat). You should also tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking vitamin E, other than the amount contained in a regular daily multivitamin. If you need to get emergency medical treatment for any reason, be sure to tell all of the doctors who treat you that you are taking tipranavir. Call your doctor immediately if you experience unusual bruising or bleeding during your treatment with tipranavir. Tipranavir (taken with ritonavir [Norvir]) may cause liver damage that may be life-threatening.

			<Question qid="0001214-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Tipranavir and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tipranavir is used with ritonavir (Norvir) and other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV). Tipranavir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although tipranavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001214-3" qtype="usage">How should Tipranavir be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tipranavir comes as a capsule and an oral solution (liquid) to take by mouth. If tipranavir is taken with ritonavir capsules or solution, it is usually twice a day with or without food. If tipranavir is taken with ritonavir tablets, it is usually twice a day with meals. Take tipranavir and ritonavir at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tipranavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not take tipranavir without ritonavir. Swallow the capsules whole; do not chew or crush them. If you are unable to swallow the capsules, tell your doctor or pharmacist. Tipranavir helps to control HIV infection but does not cure it. Continue to take tipranavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking tipranavir without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking tipranavir or skip doses, your condition may become more difficult to treat. When your supply of tipranavir starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient. Read this information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001214-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Tipranavir ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store unopened bottles of tipranavir capsules in the refrigerator. Store opened bottles of tipranavir capsules at room temperature, and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Store tipranavir solution at room temperature. Do not refrigerate or freeze tipranavir solution. Mark the date you open the bottle of tipranavir on the label; if the medication is not used within 60 days, dispose of the remaining medication. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
