			<Answer>Varicella vaccine can prevent varicella. Varicella, also called "chickenpox," causes an itchy rash that usually lasts about a week. It can also cause fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, and headache. It can lead to skin infections, pneumonia, inflammation of the blood vessels, swelling of the brain and/or spinal cord covering, and infections of the bloodstream, bone, or joints. Some people who get chickenpox get a painful rash called "shingles" (also known as herpes zoster) years later. Chickenpox is usually mild, but it can be serious in infants under 12 months of age, adolescents, adults, pregnant people, and people with a weakened immune system. Some people get so sick that they need to be hospitalized. It doesn't happen often, but people can die from chickenpox. Most people who are vaccinated with 2 doses of varicella vaccine will be protected for life.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001280-4" qtype="side effects">What are the side effects or risks of Varicella (Chickenpox) Vaccine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Sore arm from the injection, redness or rash where the shot is given, or fever can happen after varicella vaccination., More serious reactions happen very rarely. These can include pneumonia, infection of the brain and/ or spinal cord covering, or seizures that are often associated with fever., In people with serious immune system problems, this vaccine may cause an infection that may be life-threatening. People with serious immune system problems should not get varicella vaccine.,  It is possible for a vaccinated person to develop a rash. If this happens, the varicella vaccine virus could be spread to an unprotected person. Anyone who gets a rash should stay away from infants and people with a weakened immune system until the rash goes away. Talk with your health care provider to learn more. Some people who are vaccinated against chickenpox get shingles (herpes zoster) years later. This is much less common after vaccination than after chickenpox disease. People sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears. As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death.</Answer>
