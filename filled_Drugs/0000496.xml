			<Question qid="0000496-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Fexofenadine and Pseudoephedrine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine is used in adults and children 12 years of age and older to relieve the allergy symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis ('hay fever'), including runny nose; sneezing; congestion (stuffy nose); red, itchy, or watery eyes; or itching of the nose, throat, or roof of the mouth. Fexofenadine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergy symptoms. Pseudoephedrine is in a class of medications called decongestants. It works by drying up the nasal passages.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000496-2" qtype="usage">How should Fexofenadine and Pseudoephedrine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine comes as an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine 12-hour tablet is usually taken once or twice a day on an empty stomach with water. The fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine 24-hour tablet is usually taken once a day on an empty stomach with water. Fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine will work better if it is not taken with fruit juices such as orange, grapefruit, or apple juice. Take fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine controls the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis but does not cure this condition. Continue to take fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine even if you feel well and are not experiencing these symptoms. If you wait too long between doses, your symptoms may become worse. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000496-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Fexofenadine and Pseudoephedrine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
