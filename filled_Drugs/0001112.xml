			<Answer>Siltuximab injection is used to treat multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD; abnormal overgrowth of lymph cells in more than one part of the body that may cause symptoms and may increase the risk of developing a serious infection or cancer) in people who do not have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection.

			<Question qid="0001112-2" qtype="usage">How should Siltuximab Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Siltuximab injection comes as a liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) over 1 hour by a healthcare provider in a hospital or medical office. It is usually given once every 3 weeks. You may experience a reaction when you receive siltuximab injection. If you experience a reaction, your healthcare provider will stop your infusion and will give you medication to treat your reaction. If your reaction is severe, your healthcare provider may not give you any more infusions of siltuximab. Tell your healthcare provider or get emergency medical treatment if you experience any of the following symptoms during or after your infusion: trouble breathing; chest tightness; wheezing; dizziness or light-headedness; swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat; rash; itching; headache; back pain; chest pain; nausea; vomiting; flushing; reddening of the skin; or pounding heartbeat. Siltuximab injection may help to control MCD but does not cure it. Continue to keep appointments to receive siltuximab injection even if you feel well. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>
