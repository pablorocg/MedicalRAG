			<Question qid="0000271-2" qtype="usage">How should Clobazam be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Clobazam comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth, and as a film to apply on the tongue. It is usually taken once or twice a day, with or without food. Take clobazam at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. If you are unable to swallow the tablets whole, you may break them in half on the score mark or crush and mix them with a small amount of applesauce. The liquid comes an adapter and two oral dosing syringes. Use only one of the two oral dosing syringes to measure your dose and save the second syringe. If the first oral syringe is damaged or lost, the second provided syringe may be used as a replacement. To take the liquid, follow these steps:
 Before the first use, uncap the bottle and firmly insert the adapter into the neck of the bottle until the adapter top is even with the bottle top. Do not remove the adapter during the period of time you are using this bottle., Shake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly., To measure your dose, push the plunger of the syringe all the way down and insert the syringe into the adapter of the upright bottle. Then turn the bottle upside down and slowly pull the plunger back until the black ring is in line with your prescribed dose., Remove the syringe from the bottle adapter and slowly squirt the liquid from the syringe into the corner of your mouth., Place the bottle cap over the adapter after each use., Wash the oral syringe after each use. To wash the syringe, remove the plunger completely, wash the barrel and plunger with soap and water, rinse, and allow to dry. Do not place the syringe parts in the dishwasher.,  To take the film, follow these steps:
 Open the foil pouch and remove the film. Be sure that your hands are dry and clean., Place the film on the top of your tongue., Close your mouth and swallow your saliva normally. Do not chew, spit, or talk while the film dissolves. Do not take with liquids., Wash your hands.,  If your doctor has told you to take more than one film per dose, wait until the first film has completely dissolved before applying the second film. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of clobazam and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every week. Some people may respond differently to clobazam based on their heredity or genetic makeup. Your doctor may order a blood test to help find the dose of clobazam that is best for you. Clobazam may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take clobazam even if you feel well. Do not stop taking clobazam without talking to your doctor. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with clobazam and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as one week after they started taking the medication. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication.

			<Question qid="0000271-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Clobazam ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Do not open the foil pouch for the film until right before you are ready to use it. Store clobazam in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Store clobazam suspension (liquid) in an upright position. Do not use any remaining liquid more than 90 days after first opening the bottle. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
