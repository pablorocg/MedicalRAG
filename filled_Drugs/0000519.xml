			<Question qid="0000519-2" qtype="usage">How should Flurandrenolide Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Flurandrenolide comes in ointment, cream, and lotion in various strengths for use on the skin. It also comes in tape to be applied to the skin as a dressing. Flurandrenolide ointment, cream, and lotion are usually applied two or three times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use flurandrenolide exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply it to other areas of your body or use it to treat other skin conditions unless directed to do so by your doctor. Your skin condition should improve during the first 2 weeks of your treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during this time. To use flurandrenolide topical, apply a small amount of ointment, cream, or lotion  with a thin film and rub it in gently. This medication is only for use on the skin. Do not let flurandrenolide topical get into your eyes or mouth and do not swallow it. Avoid use on the face, in the genital and rectal areas, and in skin creases and armpits unless directed by your doctor. If you are using flurandrenolide on a child's diaper area, do not use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants. Such use may increase side effects. Do not apply other skin preparations or products on the treated area without talking with your doctor. Do not wrap or bandage the treated area unless your doctor tells you that you should. Such use may increase side effects. If your doctor directs you to use flurandrenolide tape, follow these steps and the special instructions that accompany this medication: Gently clean the affected area with germicidal soap (ask your pharmacist to recommend a soap) and water, removing any scales and crusts. Dry your skin thoroughly., Shave or clip the hair in the area to allow the tape to adhere well to your skin and for comfortable removal., Cut (do not tear) a piece of tape slightly larger than the treatment area and round off the corners. Remove the white paper from the tape, exposing the medicated surface. Do not let the tape stick to itself. Keep your skin smooth, and press the tape in place., Replace the tape as directed on your prescription label. Remove the old tape, wash your skin, and allow the area to dry for 1 hour before applying fresh tape., If the ends of the tape loosen before it is time to replace it, trim off the ends and replace them with new tape., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000519-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Flurandrenolide Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze it. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
