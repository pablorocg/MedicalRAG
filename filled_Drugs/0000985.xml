			<Answer>A small number of patients who used pimecrolimus cream or another similar medication developed skin cancer or lymphoma (cancer in a part of the immune system). There is not enough information available to tell whether pimecrolimus cream caused these patients to develop cancer. Studies of transplant patients and laboratory animals and an understanding of the way pimecrolimus works suggest that there is possibility that people who use pimecrolimus cream have a greater risk of developing cancer. More study is needed to understand this risk. Follow these directions carefully to decrease the possible risk that you will develop cancer during your treatment with pimecrolimus cream:

			<Question qid="0000985-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Pimecrolimus Topical and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pimecrolimus is used to control the symptoms of eczema (atopic dermatitis; a skin disease that causes the skin to be dry and itchy and to sometimes develop red, scaly rashes). Pimecrolimus is only used to treat patients who cannot use other medications for eczema, or whose symptoms were not controlled by other medications. Pimecrolimus is in a class of medications called topical calcineurin inhibitors. It works by stopping the immune system from producing substances that may cause eczema.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000985-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Pimecrolimus Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
