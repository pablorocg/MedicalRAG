			<Question qid="0000634-2" qtype="usage">How should Interferon Gamma-1b Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Interferon gamma-1b injection comes as a solution to inject subcutaneously (just under the skin) three times a week, for example, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Inject interferon gamma-1b injection at around the same time of day each time you inject it. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use interferon gamma-1b injection exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You will receive your first dose of interferon gamma-1b in your doctor's office. Then you can inject interferon gamma-1b yourself or have a friend or relative give the injections. Before you use interferon gamma-1b yourself the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it. Never reuse or share syringes, needles, or vials of medication. Throw away used needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container and throw away used vials of medication in the trash. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container. You can inject interferon gamma-1b in your upper arms, stomach area, or your thighs. Choose a different spot each time you inject your medication. Do not inject your medication into skin that is irritated, bruised, reddened, infected, or scarred. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet when you begin treatment with interferon gamma-1b and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000634-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Interferon Gamma-1b Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the refrigerator and out of reach of children. Interferon gamma-1b may be left at room temperature for no longer than 12 hours. Do not freeze interferon gamma-1b. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
