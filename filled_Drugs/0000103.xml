			<Question qid="0000103-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Avanafil and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Avanafil is used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED: impotence; inability to get or keep an erection in men). Avanafil is in a class of medications called phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors. It works by increasing blood flow to the penis during sexual stimulation. This increased blood flow can cause an erection. Avanafil does not cure erectile dysfunction or increase sexual desire. Avanafil does not prevent pregnancy or the spread of sexually transmitted diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000103-2" qtype="usage">How should Avanafil be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Avanafil comes as a tablet to take by mouth. For men taking the 100-mg or 200-mg doses, avanafil is usually taken with or without food as needed, about 15 minutes before sexual activity. For men taking the 50-mg dose, avanafil is usually taken with or without food as needed, about 30 minutes before sexual activity. Do not take avanafil more often than once in 24 hours. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take avanafil exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of avanafil and may increase or decrease your dose depending on how you respond to the medication. Tell your doctor if avanafil is not working well or if you experience side effects. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000103-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Avanafil ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
