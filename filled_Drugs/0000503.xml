			<Answer>Flibanserin may cause very low blood pressure resulting in dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease or if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol. Drinking alcohol around the same time as taking flibanserin can increase the risk of having very low blood pressure. Wait at least 2 hours after drinking 1 or 2 alcoholic drinks before taking flibanserin at bedtime. If you drink 3 or more alcoholic drinks in the evening, skip your flibanserin dose on that evening. After taking flibanserin at bedtime, do not drink any alcohol until the following day. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take flibanserin. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medications or have taken them in the last 2 weeks: amprenavir (Agenerase; no longer available in the U.S.), atazanavir (Reyataz, in Evotaz), boceprevir (Victrelis), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), clarithromycin (Biaxin, in Prevpac), conivaptan (Vaprisol), diltiazem (Cartia XT, Diltzac, Tiazac, others), erythromycin (E.E.S., Erytab, Erythrocin), fluconazole (Diflucan), fosamprenavir (Lexiva), indinavir (Crixivan), itraconazole (Onmel, Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral), nefazodone, nelfinavir (Viracept), posaconazole (Noxafil), ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra, in Viekira Pak), saquinavir (Invirase), telaprevir (Incivek; no longer available in the U.S.), telithromycin (Ketek), and verapamil (Calan, Covera, Verelan, in Tarka).

			<Question qid="0000503-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Flibanserin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
