			<Question qid="0000424-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Emtricitabine and Tenofovir ?</Question>
			<Answer>Emtricitabine and tenofovir should not be used to treat hepatitis B virus infection (HBV; an ongoing liver infection). Tell your doctor if you have or think you may have HBV. Your doctor may test you to see if you have HBV before you begin your treatment with emtricitabine and tenofovir. If you have HBV and you take emtricitabine and tenofovir, your condition may suddenly worsen when you stop taking emtricitabine and tenofovir. Your doctor will examine you and order lab tests regularly for several months after you stop taking emtricitabine and tenofovir to see if your HBV has worsened. If you are taking emtricitabine and tenofovir to help prevent you from getting HIV, your doctor will test you to see if you have HIV before you begin your treatment. Tell your doctor if you have had any of the following symptoms in the last month or if you have any of the following symptoms while taking emtricitabine and tenofovir to help prevent you from getting HIV: fever, tiredness, joint or muscle pain, rash, night sweats, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, sore throat, swollen neck or groin area. Tell your doctor if you think you may have been exposed to HIV. Emtricitabine and tenofovir does not always prevent HIV. Your doctor will order HIV tests at least every 3 months while you are taking emtricitabine and tenofovir to see if you have become infected with HIV. Emtricitabine and tenofovir should only be used in combination with other medications to treat HIV. If emtricitabine and tenofovir are used alone to treat HIV, your condition may become more difficult to treat. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests before and during your treatment to check your body's response to emtricitabine and tenofovir. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with emtricitabine and tenofovir and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking emtricitabine and tenofovir.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000424-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Emtricitabine and Tenofovir and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir (Descovy, Truvada) is used along with other medications to treat HIV in adults and children who weigh at least 37 pounds (17 kg). Emtricitabine and tenofovir (Truvada) is also used along with practicing safer sex (e.g., condom use) to reduce the risk of HIV infection) in high-risk adults and teenagers who weigh at least 77 pounds (35 kg). Emtricitabine and tenofovir are in a class of medications called nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). They work by slowing the spread of HIV in the body. Although emtricitabine and tenofovir will not cure HIV, these medications may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of getting or transmitting the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000424-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Emtricitabine and Tenofovir ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
