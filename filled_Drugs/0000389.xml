			<Question qid="0000389-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Dolutegravir and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dolutegravir is used with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults and children 4 weeks of age and older who weigh at least 6.6 lbs (3 kg). It is also used in combination with rilpivirine (Edurant) to treat HIV in certain adults to replace their current HIV medication(s) that has been taken for at least 6 months. Dolutegravir is in a class of medications called HIV integrase inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in your blood and increasing the number of immune cells that help fight infections in your body. Although dolutegravir does not cure HIV, using it along with other medications may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000389-2" qtype="usage">How should Dolutegravir be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dolutegravir comes as a tablet and as a tablet for suspension (a tablet to dissolve in liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food. Take dolutegravir at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take dolutegravir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not chew, cut, or crush the tablets for oral suspension. You can swallow the tablet whole, one at a time, or mix them with drinking water before use. If you mix the tablets for oral suspension in drinking water, add the prescribed number of tablet(s) to a dosing cup. If taking 1 or 3 tablet(s) for oral suspension, add 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of drinking water to the cup. If taking 4, 5, or 6 tablets for oral suspension, add 2 teaspoons (10 mL) of drinking water to the cup. Do not use any other liquid to dissolve the tablet. Swirl the cup for 1 or 2 minutes or until the mixture is completely dissolved; the mixture will appear cloudy. When the tablet(s) for suspension completely dissolve, drink the mixture right after mixing it. If it has been more than 30 minutes after mixing the mixture, discard the mixture. If giving the tablets for suspension mixture to a child, make sure that he or she is upright when taking it. If there is remaining mixture in the cup, add another 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of drinking water to the cup, swirl, and give it all to the child to make sure the child gets the full dose. If giving the tablets for suspension mixture to an infant, use the oral syringe provided to measure and give the dose. Place the tip of the syringe into the dosing cup with the prepared mixture to draw it up into the syringe. Place the tip of the oral syringe into the child's mouth against the inside of the cheek. Gently push down on the plunger to give the dose slowly. Allow time for the infant to swallow the mixture. Add another 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of drinking water to the cup and swirl. Draw up the remaining mixture into the syringe and give it all to the infant. Repeat if any of the mixture remains in the syringe to make sure the infant gets the full dose. The mixture should be given to the baby within 30 minutes of mixing. After the dose, wash the cup and syringe parts separately with water. Allow parts to dry completely before reassembling and storing. Do not switch from tablets to tablet(s) for suspension without first talking to your doctor. Continue to take dolutegravir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking dolutegravir without talking to your doctor. When your supply of dolutegravir runs low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. If you stop taking dolutegravir or miss doses, your condition may become worse and more difficult to treat with medication. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000389-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Dolutegravir ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not remove the desiccant (small packet that contains a substance that absorbs moisture to keep the medication dry) from the bottle. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
