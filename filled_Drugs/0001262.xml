			<Question qid="0001262-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Ulipristal and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ulipristal is used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sexual intercourse (sex without any method of birth control or with a birth control method that failed or was not used properly [e.g., a condom that slipped or broke or birth control pills that were not taken as scheduled]). Ulipristal should not be used to prevent pregnancy on a regular basis. This medication is to be used as an emergency contraceptive or backup in case regular birth control fails or is used incorrectly. Ulipristal is in a class of medications called progestins. It works by preventing or delaying the release of an egg from the ovary. It also may work by changing the lining of the uterus (womb) to prevent development of a pregnancy. Ulipristal may prevent pregnancy, but it will not prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) and other sexually transmitted diseases.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001262-2" qtype="usage">How should Ulipristal be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ulipristal comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food as soon as possible after unprotected sexual intercourse or suspected  failure of a hormonal contraceptive (such as birth control pills, rings or patches). Ulipristal may be taken up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected sexual intercourse, but the sooner it is taken, the more likely that it will prevent pregnancy. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ulipristal exactly as directed. Ulipristal may be used at any time during the menstrual cycle. However, it should not be used more than once during the same menstrual cycle. If you vomit less than 3 hours after you take ulipristal, call your doctor. You may need to take another dose of this medication. Because you can become pregnant right after treatment with ulipristal, you should use a barrier method (condom or diaphragm with spermicide) every time you have sex until your next menstrual period. Using hormonal contraceptives within 5 days of taking ulipristal may make both medications less effective. You may begin or resume using hormonal contraceptives at least 5 days after taking ulipristal, but you must continue to also use a barrier method to prevent pregnancy until after you have your next period. If you took ulipristal because of a problem with your hormonal contraceptive, contact your doctor or follow the instructions provided for that specific birth control product.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001262-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Ulipristal ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat, and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
