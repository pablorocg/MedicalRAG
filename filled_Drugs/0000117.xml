			<Question qid="0000117-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Balsalazide and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Balsalazide is used to treat ulcerative colitis (a condition which causes swelling and sores in the lining of the colon [large intestine] and rectum) in adults and children 5 years of age and older. Balsalazide is an anti-inflammatory drug. It is converted in the body to mesalamine and works by reducing bowel inflammation, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and stomach pain.

			<Question qid="0000117-2" qtype="usage">How should Balsalazide be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Balsalazide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food three times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take balsalazide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Balsalazide is usually taken for 8 weeks, but it may be taken for up to 12 weeks. Continue to take balsalazide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking balsalazide without talking to your doctor. Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If you cannot swallow the capsules or if you are giving this medication to a child, you may open the capsules and sprinkle the contents over 2 teaspoonfuls (approximately 10 mL) of applesauce. Eat the mixture right away and swallow; if necessary you can chew the mixture. If you are taking balsalazide capsules mixed with applesauce, you should know that your teeth and tongue may be stained. Drink plenty of fluids while taking balsalazide capsules.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000117-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Balsalazide ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
