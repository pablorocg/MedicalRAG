			<Question qid="0001051-3" qtype="usage">How should Ramucirumab Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ramucirumab injection comes as a liquid to be injected into a vein over 30 or 60 minutes by a doctor or nurse in a hospital or medical facility.

The length of your treatment depends on how well your body responds to the medication and the side effects that you experience. Your doctor may need to interrupt or stop your treatment if you experience certain side effects. Your doctor will give you other medications to prevent or treat certain side effects before you receive each dose of ramucirumab injection.
