			<Question qid="0000533-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Formoterol Oral Inhalation and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Formoterol oral inhalation is used to control wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of lung diseases that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema). Formoterol is in a class of medications called long-acting beta agonists (LABAs). It works by relaxing and opening air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000533-3" qtype="usage">How should Formoterol Oral Inhalation be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Formoterol oral inhalation comes as a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). It is usually inhaled twice a day in the morning and the evening about 12 hours after you inhaled your last dose. Inhale formoterol at about the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use formoterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not use formoterol to treat sudden attacks of COPD. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting beta agonist medication such as albuterol (Accuneb, Proair, Proventil, Ventolin) to use during attacks. If you were using this type of medication on a regular basis before you began treatment with formoterol, your doctor will probably tell you to stop using it regularly, but to continue to use it to treat attacks. Formoterol inhalation should not be used to treat COPD that is quickly getting worse. Call your doctor or get emergency medical help if your breathing problems worsen, if you have to use your short-acting inhaler to treat attacks of COPD more often, or if your short-acting inhaler does not relieve your symptoms. Formoterol inhalation may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Do not stop using formoterol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using formoterol, your symptoms may worsen. To inhale the solution using a nebulizer, follow these steps:
 Remove one vial of formoterol inhalation solution from the foil pouch., Look at the liquid in the vial. It should be clear and colorless. Do not use the vial if the liquid is cloudy or discolored., Twist off the top of the vial and squeeze all of the liquid into the nebulizer reservoir. Do not mix other medications with formoterol in the reservoir., Connect the nebulizer reservoir to the mouthpiece or face mask., Connect the nebulizer to the compressor., Place the mouthpiece in your mouth or put on the face mask. Sit in an upright, comfortable position and turn on the compressor., Breathe in calmly, deeply, and evenly for about 9 minutes until mist stops forming in the nebulizer chamber., Dispose of the empty vial and its top safely, so that they are out of the reach of children.,  Clean your nebulizer regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your nebulizer. Do not mix the formoterol solution with other inhalation solutions in your nebulizer. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000533-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Formoterol Oral Inhalation ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep formoterol vials of nebulizer solution sealed in their foil pouches and away from light and excess heat and until you are ready to use them. Store the nebulizer solution in the refrigerator. You can also store it at room temperature for up to 3 months. Keep this medication out of reach of children. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
