			<Question qid="0001253-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Trifluridine and Tipiracil and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of trifluridine and tipiracil is used alone or in combination with bevacizumab (Avastin) to treat colon (large intestine) or rectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body in people who have already been treated with other chemotherapy medications or cannot receive these chemotherapy medications. The combination of trifluridine and tipiracil is also used to treat certain types of stomach cancer or cancer located in the area where the stomach meets the esophagus (the tube between the throat and stomach) that has spread to other parts of the body in people who have already received at least two other chemotherapy treatments. Trifluridine is in a class of medications called thymidine-based nucleoside analogues. It works by stopping the growth of cancer cells. Tipiracil is in a class of medications called thymidine phosphorylase inhibitors. It works by slowing the breakdown of trifluridine by the body.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001253-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Trifluridine and Tipiracil ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). If you have stored this medication outside the container it came in, dispose of all unused tablets after 30 days. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
