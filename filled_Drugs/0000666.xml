			<Question qid="0000666-2" qtype="usage">How should Ketorolac Ophthalmic be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ophthalmic ketorolac comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eyes. For allergy symptoms, one drop is usually instilled in the affected eyes four times a day. For inflammation after cataract surgery, one drop is usually instilled in the affected eye four times a day for 2 weeks beginning 24 hours after surgery. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ketorolac ophthalmic exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more than prescribed by your doctor. Your allergy symptom (itchy eyes) should improve when you instill the eye drops. If your symptoms do not improve or if they worsen, call your doctor. For treatment of itchy eyes caused by allergies, continue to use ketorolac eye drops until you are no longer exposed to the substance that causes your symptom, allergy season is over, or your doctor tells you to stop using it. To instill the eye drops, follow these steps:
 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water., Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked., Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean., While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket., Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it., Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face., While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid., Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids., Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure., Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue., If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop., Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip., Wash your hands to remove any medication., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000666-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Ketorolac Ophthalmic ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
