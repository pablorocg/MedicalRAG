			<Question qid="0000443-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Ertapenem Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ertapenem injection is used to treat certain serious infections, including pneumonia and urinary tract, skin, diabetic foot, gynecological, pelvic, and abdominal (stomach area) infections, that are caused by bacteria. It is also used for the prevention of infections following colorectal surgery. Ertapenem is in a class of medications called carbapenem antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as ertapenem injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000443-2" qtype="usage">How should Ertapenem Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ertapenem injection comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) or intramuscularly (into a muscle). It is infused (injected slowly) intravenously over a period of at least 30 minutes once or twice a day for up to 14 days. It is also may be given once or twice a day intramuscularly for up to 7 days. The length of treatment depends on the type of infection being treated. Your doctor will tell you how long to use ertapenem injection. After your condition improves, your doctor may switch you to another antibiotic that you can take by mouth to complete your treatment. You may receive ertapenem injection in a hospital, or you may use the medication at home. If you will be using ertapenem injection at home, use it at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or other healthcare provider to explain any part you do not understand. Use ertapenem injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you will be using ertapenem injection at home, your health care provider will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Ask your healthcare provider what to do if you have any problems infusing ertapenem injection. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with ertapenem injection. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor. Use ertapenem injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using ertapenem injection too soon or if you skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>
