			<Question qid="0001266-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Ursodiol and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ursodiol is used to dissolve gallstones in people who do not want surgery or cannot have surgery to remove gallstones. Ursodiol is also used to prevent the formation of gallstones in overweight people who are losing weight very quickly. Ursodiol is used to treat people with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC; formerly known as a primary biliary cirrhosis; an autoimmune liver disease). Ursodiol is in a class of medications called gallstone dissolution agents. It works by decreasing the production of cholesterol and by dissolving the cholesterol in bile to prevent stone formation and by decreasing toxic levels of bile acids that accumulate in primary biliary cirrhosis.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001266-2" qtype="usage">How should Ursodiol be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ursodiol comes as a capsule and as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken two or three times a day with or without food to treat gallstones and two times a day to prevent gallstones in people who are losing weight quickly. If you are taking the tablets to treat primary biliary cholangitis, they are usually taken 2 or 4 times a day with food. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ursodiol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you need to break the tablet for your specific dose, place the tablet on a flat surface with the scored section on the top. Hold the tablet with your thumbs close to the scored part and apply gentle pressure to snap the tablet into two parts. Swallow the half tablet with water; do not chew the half tablet. Because the tablet has a strong bitter taste, store the other tablet half in a separate container from the whole tablets. Use the stored half tablet within 28 days. If you have any questions, your doctor or pharmacist will tell you how to break the tablets and how you should take and store them. This medication must be taken for months to have an effect. If you are taking ursodiol capsules to dissolve gall stones, you may need to take ursodiol for up to 2 years. Your gallstones may not completely dissolve, and even if your gallstones do dissolve you may have gallstones again within 5 years after successful treatment with ursodiol. Continue to take ursodiol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ursodiol without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001266-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Ursodiol ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.
