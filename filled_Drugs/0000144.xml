			<Question qid="0000144-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Bexarotene ?</Question>
			<Answer>Bexarotene must not be taken by patients who are pregnant or who may become pregnant. There is a high risk that bexarotene will cause the baby to be born with birth defects (problems that are present at birth). Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking bexarotene. For female patients: If you can become pregnant, you will need to avoid becoming pregnant during your treatment with bexarotene. You must use two acceptable forms of birth control for 1 month before you begin to take bexarotene, at all times during your treatment, and for 1 month after your treatment. Your doctor will tell you which forms of birth control are acceptable. Bexarotene may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, implants, and injections), so it is especially important to use a second form of birth control along with this type of contraceptive. You will begin to take bexarotene on the second or third day of your menstrual period. You must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 week of the start of your treatment and every month during your treatment. After each negative pregnancy test, you will be given only 1 month's supply of bexarotene. Stop taking bexarotene and call your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant, you miss a menstrual period, or you have sex without using two forms of birth control. For male patients: You must use a condom every time you have sexual contact with a female who is pregnant or able to become pregnant while you are taking bexarotene and for 1 month after your treatment. Call your doctor if your partner becomes pregnant during this time.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000144-3" qtype="usage">How should Bexarotene be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Bexarotene comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with food.  Take bexarotene at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take bexarotene exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the capsules whole; do not chew the capsules or dissolve them in liquid or in your mouth. If you are unable to swallow the capsules whole, talk to your doctor. Bexarotene may be harmful if it gets on the skin. Do not touch the capsules or powder from the capsules if they are broken or leaking. If the powder from a broken capsule gets on your skin, wash the area with soap and water immediately and call your doctor. Your doctor will start you on an average dose of bexarotene and may decrease your dose if you experience side effects or increase your dose if your condition does not improve. It may take several months or longer before you notice the full benefit of bexarotene.  Do not stop taking bexarotene without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000144-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Bexarotene ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat, light, and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
