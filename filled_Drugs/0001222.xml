			<Question qid="0001222-3" qtype="usage">How should Tolcapone be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tolcapone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken three times a day. Your doctor will most likely prescribe this in addition to levodopa and carbidopa (Sinemet). Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tolcapone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Tolcapone controls symptoms of Parkinson's disease but does not cure it. Continue to take tolcapone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking tolcapone without talking to your doctor. Abrupt discontinuation of tolcapone may cause high fever and confusion.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001222-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Tolcapone ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
