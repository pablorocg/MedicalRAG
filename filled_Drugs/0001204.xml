			<Question qid="0001204-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Tiagabine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tiagabine is used in combination with other medications to treat partial seizures (a type of epilepsy). Tiagabine is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It is not known exactly how tiagabine works, but it increases the amount of natural chemicals in the brain that prevent seizure activity.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001204-2" qtype="usage">How should Tiagabine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tiagabine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken with food two to four times a day. However, for the first week of treatment you will only take tiagabine once a day. Your doctor will slowly increase your dose (not more often than once each week) until you reach the dose of tiagabine you are to take regularly. To help you remember to take tiagabine, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tiagabine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Continue to take tiagabine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking tiagabine without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. Abruptly stopping this medication can cause seizures. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with tiagabine and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001204-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Tiagabine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
