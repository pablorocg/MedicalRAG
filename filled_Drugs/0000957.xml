			<Question qid="0000957-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Penicillin G (Potassium, Sodium) Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Penicillin G injection is used to treat and prevent certain infections caused by bacteria. Penicillin G injection is in a class of medications called penicillins. It works by killing bacteria that cause infections. Antibiotics such as penicillin G injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000957-2" qtype="usage">How should Penicillin G (Potassium, Sodium) Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Penicillin G injection comes as a powder to be mixed with water and as a premixed product. Penicillin G injection is usually injected into a muscle or vein but may also be given directly into the lining of the chest cavity, into the fluid surrounding the spinal cord, or into a joint or other areas. The number of doses you receive each day and the total length of your treatment depend on your general health, the type of infection that you have, and how well you respond to the medication. You may receive penicillin G injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you will be receiving penicillin G injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with penicillin G injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Use penicillin G injection for as long as your doctor tells you that you should, even if you feel better. If you stop using penicillin G injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics. If you are using penicillin G injection to treat certain infections such as syphilis (a sexually transmitted disease), Lyme disease (an infection transmitted by tick bites that may cause problems with the heart, joints, and nervous system), or relapsing fever (an infection transmitted by tick bites that causes repeated episodes of fever), you may experience a reaction beginning one or two hours after receiving your first dose of this medication and lasting for 12 to 24 hours. Tell your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms: fever, chills, muscle aches, headache, worsening of skin sores, fast heartbeat, fast breathing, and flushing.</Answer>
