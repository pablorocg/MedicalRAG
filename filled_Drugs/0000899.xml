			<Question qid="0000899-2" qtype="usage">How should Omacetaxine Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Omacetaxine injection comes as a liquid to be injected under the skin by a healthcare provider in a medical facility or you may be given the medication to use at home. At the beginning of treatment, it is usually given twice a day for the first 14 days of a 28-day cycle. Once your doctor finds that you are responding to omacetaxine injection, it is usually given twice a day for the first 7 days of a 28-day cycle. If you will be using omacetaxine injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you or your caregiver how to store, inject, dispose of the medication and supplies. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Ask your healthcare provider what to do if you have any problems using omacetaxine injection. If you are receiving this medication at home, you or your caregiver must use disposable gloves and protective eye wear when handling omacetaxine injection. Before putting the gloves on and after taking them off, wash your hands. Do not eat or drink while handling omacetaxine. Omacetaxine must be given in a location away from food or food preparation areas (e.g., kitchen), children, and pregnant women. You can inject omacetaxine injection anywhere on the front of your thighs (upper leg) or abdomen (stomach) except your navel and the area 2 inches (5 centimeters) around it. If a caregiver injects the medication, the back of the upper arm may also be used. To reduce the chances of soreness or redness, use a different site for each injection. Do not inject into an area where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, or where there are scars or stretch marks. Be careful not to get omacetaxine injection on your skin or in your eyes. If omacetaxine does get on your skin. wash the skin with soap and water. If omacetaxine gets into your eyes, flush the eye with water. After washing or flushing, call your healthcare provider as soon as possible. Your doctor may delay the start of a treatment cycle or may decrease the number of days that you receive omacetaxine injection during a treatment cycle if you experience serious side effects of the medication or if blood tests show a decrease in the number of blood cells you have. Be sure to talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment.</Answer>
