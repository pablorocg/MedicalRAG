			<Question qid="0000379-1" qtype="why get vaccinated">Why get vaccinated with Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTaP) Vaccine ?</Question>
			<Answer>DTaP vaccine can prevent diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. Diphtheria and pertussis spread from person to person. Tetanus enters the body through cuts or wounds. DIPHTHERIA (D)  can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure, paralysis, and death. TETANUS (T)  causes painful tightening of the muscles. Tetanus can lead to serious health problems, including being unable to open the mouth, having trouble swallowing and breathing, or death. PERTUSSIS (aP) , also known as "whooping cough," can cause uncontrollable, violent coughing that makes it hard to breathe, eat, or drink. Pertussis can be extremely serious especially in babies and young children, causing pneumonia, convulsions, brain damage, or death. In teens and adults, it can cause weight loss, loss of bladder control, passing out, and rib fractures from severe coughing.</Answer>

			<Answer>Soreness or swelling where the shot was given, fever, fussiness, feeling tired, loss of appetite, and vomiting sometimes happen after DTaP vaccination., More serious reactions, such as seizures, nonstop crying for 3 hours or more, or high fever (over 105&#176;F) after DTaP vaccination happen much less often. Rarely, the vaccine is followed by swelling of the entire arm or leg, especially in older children when they receive their fourth or fifth dose.,  As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death.</Answer>
