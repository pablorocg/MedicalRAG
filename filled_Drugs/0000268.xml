			<Question qid="0000268-2" qtype="usage">How should Clindamycin Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Topical clindamycin comes as a foam, a gel, a solution (liquid), a lotion, and a pledget (swab) to apply to the skin. The foam and one brand of the gel (Clindagel &#174; ) are usually applied once a day. The solution, lotion, pledgets, and most brands of gel are applied twice a day. Apply topical clindamycin at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use topical clindamycin exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Topical clindamycin is only for use on the skin. Do not swallow the medication, and do not get the medication in your eyes, nose, mouth, or vagina. If you do get the medication in your eyes, nose, or mouth, or on broken skin, rinse it out with plenty of cool water. Your medication will probably come with directions for use. Read these directions and follow them carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to apply topical clindamycin. Shake the lotion well before each use to mix the medication evenly. The pledgets are for one-time use only. Do not remove a pledget from its foil pouch until you are ready to use it. Dispose of each pledget after you have used it one time. The foam may catch fire. Stay away from open flames and do not smoke while you are applying the foam and for a short time afterward.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000268-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Clindamycin Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze. Do not expose clindamycin foam to temperatures higher than 120 &#176;F (49 &#176;C), and do not puncture or incinerate the container. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
