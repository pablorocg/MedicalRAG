			<Question qid="0001285-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Verteporfin Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Verteporfin injection is used in combination with photodynamic therapy (PDT; treatment with a laser light) to treat abnormal growth of leaky blood vessels in the eye caused by wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD; an ongoing disease of the eye that causes loss of the ability to see straight ahead and may make it more difficult to read, drive, or perform other daily activities), pathologic myopia (a serious form of nearsightedness that worsens with time), or histoplasmosis (a fungal infection) of the eye. Verteporfin is in a class of medications called photosensitizing agents. When verteporfin is activated by light, it closes up the leaking blood vessels. </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001285-2" qtype="usage">How should Verteporfin Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Verteporfin injection comes as a solid powder cake to be made into a solution to be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor. Verteporfin is usually infused over 10 minutes. Fifteen minutes after the start of the verteporfin infusion, your doctor will administer a special laser light to your eye. If both of your eyes need treatment, the doctor will administer the laser light to your second eye immediately after the first eye. If you have never used verteporfin before and both your eyes need treatment, the doctor will treat only one eye with the laser light on your first visit. If you do not have any serious problems due to the treatment, the doctor will treat your second eye 1 week later with another verteporfin infusion and laser light treatment. Your doctor will examine your eyes 3 months after verteporfin and PDT treatment to decide whether you need another treatment.</Answer>
