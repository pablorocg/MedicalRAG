			<Question qid="0001271-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Valrubicin Intravesical and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Valrubicin solution is used to treat a type of bladder cancer (carcinoma  in situ ; CIS) that was not effectively treated with another medication (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin; BCG therapy) in patients that can not have surgery right away to remove all or part of the bladder. However, only about 1 out of 5 patients responds to treatment with valrubicin and delaying bladder surgery may lead to the spread of bladder cancer which may be life-threatening. Valrubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic that is only used in cancer chemotherapy. It slows or stops the growth of cancer cells in your body.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001271-2" qtype="usage">How should Valrubicin Intravesical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Valrubicin comes as a solution (liquid) to be infused (injected slowly) through a catheter (small flexible plastic tube) into your bladder while you are lying down. Valrubicin solution is given by a doctor or a health care provider in a medical office, hospital, or clinic. It is usually given once a week for 6 weeks. You should keep the medication in your bladder for 2 hours or as long as possible. At the end of 2 hours you will empty your bladder. You may have symptoms of an irritable bladder during or shortly after treatment with valrubicin solution such as a sudden need to urinate or leaking of urine, If any valrubicin solution leaks out of the bladder and gets on your skin, the area should be cleaned with soap and water. Spills on the floor should be cleaned with undiluted bleach. Drink plenty of fluids after receiving your treatment with valrubicin. Your doctor will watch you carefully to see how well treatment with valrubicin works for you. If you do not respond fully to treatment after 3 months or if your cancer returns, your doctor will probably recommend treatment with surgery.</Answer>
