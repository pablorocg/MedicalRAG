			<Question qid="0000100-2" qtype="usage">How should Atovaquone be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Atovaquone comes as a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. When atovaquone is used to treat pneumonia, it is usually taken with meals twice a day for 21 days. When atovaquone is used to prevent pneumonia, it is usually taken with a meal once a day. Take atovaquone at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take atovaquone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If your medication comes in a bottle, shake the bottle gently before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use a dose measuring spoon or a cup to measure the correct amount of liquid for each dose, not a regular household spoon. If your medication comes in a packet, you may drink the medication directly from the packet or pour the medication into a dosing spoon or cup. Take this medication until you finish the prescription. Do not stop taking the medication early even if you are taking it to treat pneumonia and you feel better. If you stop taking atovaquone too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated or you may not be protected from future infections. If you have PCP, you may also have other types of lung infections. Atovaquone will not treat these infections. Your doctor may prescribe other antibiotics for you to take along with this medication.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000100-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Atovaquone ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze this medication. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
