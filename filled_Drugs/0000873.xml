			<Question qid="0000873-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Nitroglycerin Spray and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nitroglycerin spray is used to treat episodes of angina (chest pain) in people who have coronary artery disease (narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart). The spray may also be used just before activities that may cause episodes of angina in order to prevent the angina from occurring. Nitroglycerin is in a class of medications called vasodilators. It works by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not need to work as hard and therefore does not need as much oxygen.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000873-2" qtype="usage">How should Nitroglycerin Spray be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nitroglycerin comes as a spray to use on or under the tongue. The spray is usually used as needed, either 5 to 10 minutes before activities that may cause attacks of angina or at the first sign of an attack. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nitroglycerin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Nitroglycerin may not work as well after you have used it for some time or if you have used many doses. Use the fewest number of sprays needed to relieve the pain of your attacks. If your angina attacks happen more often, last longer, or become more severe at any time during your treatment, call your doctor. Talk to your doctor about how to use nitroglycerin spray to treat angina attacks. Your doctor will probably tell you to sit down and use one dose of nitroglycerin when an attack begins. If your symptoms do not improve very much or if they worsen after you use this dose you may be told to call for emergency medical help right away. If your symptoms do not go away completely after you use the first dose, your doctor may tell you to use a second dose after 5 minutes have passed and a third dose 5 minutes after the second dose. Call for emergency medical help right away if your chest pain has not gone away completely 5 minutes after you use the third dose. To use the spray, follow these steps:
 Sit down if possible, and hold the container without shaking it. Remove the plastic cap., If you are using the container for the first time, hold the container upright so that it is pointed away from yourself and others, and press the button 10 times when using Nitromist or 5 times when using Nitrolingual pumpspray to prime the container. If you are not using the container for the first time but have not used it within 6 weeks, press the button 2 times to reprime the container when using Nitromist or 1 time when using Nitrolingual pumpspray. If Nitrolingual has not been used in 3 months or longer, press the button up to 5 times to re-prime the container., Open your mouth. Hold the container upright, as close to your mouth as possible., Use your forefinger to press the button firmly. This will release a spray into your mouth. Do not inhale the spray., Close your mouth. Do not spit out the medication or rinse your mouth for 5 to 10 minutes., Replace the plastic cap on the container., Check the level of liquid in the container from time to time to be sure that you will always have enough medication on hand. Hold the container upright while you are checking. If the liquid reaches the top or middle of the hole on the side of the container, you should order more medication. If the liquid is at the bottom of the hole, the container will no longer dispense full doses of medication.,  Do not try to open the container of nitroglycerin spray. This product may catch fire, so do not use near an open flame, and do not allow the container to be burned after use.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000873-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Nitroglycerin Spray ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
