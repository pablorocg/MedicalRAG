			<Question qid="0001165-2" qtype="usage">How should Teduglutide Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Teduglutide comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid and injected subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually injected once a day. Inject teduglutide at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Inject teduglutide exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you inject more teduglutide than prescribed by your doctor, call your doctor right away. Continue to use teduglutide even if you feel well. Do not stop using teduglutide without talking to your doctor. You may inject teduglutide yourself or have a friend or relative give the injections. You and the person who will be injecting the medication should read the manufacturer's directions for mixing and injecting the medication before you use it for the first time at home. Ask your doctor to show you or the person who will be injecting teduglutide how to mix and inject it. Teduglutide comes as a kit containing vials of teduglutide powder for injection, prefilled syringes containing diluent (liquid to be mixed with teduglutide powder), needles to attach to the diluent syringe, dosing syringes with needles attached, and alcohol swab pads. Dispose of needles, syringes, and vials in a puncture-resistant container after you use them once. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container. Always look at your teduglutide injection before you inject it. The solution should be clear and colorless or pale yellow, with no particles in it. Teduglutide must be used within 3 hours after mixing teduglutide powder with the diluent. You can inject your teduglutide in your upper arm, thigh, or stomach. Never inject teduglutide into a vein or muscle. Use a different injection site each day. Do not inject teduglutide into any area that is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with teduglutide injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001165-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Teduglutide Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze teduglutide. Use the teduglutide powder for injection by the expiration date on the ''Use By'' sticker on the kit. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
