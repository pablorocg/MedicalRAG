			<Question qid="0001198-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Thiamine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Thiamine (vitamin B 1 ) is used as a dietary supplement when the amount of thiamine in the diet is not enough. People most at risk for thiamine deficiency are older adults, those who are dependent on alcohol, or who have HIV/AIDS, diabetes, malabsorption syndrome (problems absorbing food), or have had bariatric surgery (an operation that helps you lose weight by making changes to your digestive system).  Thiamine is used to treat beriberi (tingling and numbness in feet and hands, muscle loss, and poor reflexes caused by a lack of thiamine in the diet) and to treat and prevent Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (tingling and numbness in hands and feet, memory loss, confusion caused by a lack of thiamine in the diet). Thiamine is in a class of medications called vitamins. It is needed by the body to turn foods into energy, which is important for the growth, development, and function of cells.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001198-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Thiamine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
