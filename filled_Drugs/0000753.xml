			<Question qid="0000753-1" qtype="why get vaccinated">Why get vaccinated with Meningococcal Group B Vaccine (MenB) ?</Question>
			<Answer>Meningococcal B vaccine can help protect against meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B. A different meningococcal vaccine is available that can help protect against serogroups A, C, W, and Y. Meningococcal disease can cause meningitis (infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord) and infections of the blood. Even when it is treated, meningococcal disease kills 10 to 15 infected people out of 100. And of those who survive, about 10 to 20 out of every 100 will suffer disabilities such as hearing loss, brain damage, kidney damage, loss of limbs, nervous system problems, or severe scars from skin grafts. Meningococcal disease is rare and has declined in the United States since the 1990s. However, it is a severe disease with a significant risk of death or lasting disabilities in people who get it. Anyone can get meningococcal disease. Certain people are at increased risk, including:
 Infants younger than one year old, Adolescents and young adults 16 through 23 years old, People with certain medical conditions that affect the immune system, Microbiologists who routinely work with isolates of  N. meningitidis , the bacteria that cause meningococcal disease, People at risk because of an outbreak in their community, </Answer>
