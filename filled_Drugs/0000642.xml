			<Question qid="0000642-2" qtype="usage">How should Iron Sucrose Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Iron sucrose injection comes as a solution (liquid) to inject intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or hospital outpatient clinic. It is usually injected over 2 to 5 minutes or may be mixed with another fluid and infused slowly over 15 minutes to 4 hours depending on your dose of medication. Your doctor will determine how often you receive iron sucrose injection and your total number of doses based on your condition and how well you respond to the medication. If your iron levels become low after you finish your treatment, your doctor may prescribe this medication again. Iron sucrose injection may cause severe or life-threatening reactions while you receive the medication. Your doctor will watch you carefully while you receive each dose of iron sucrose injection and for at least 30 minutes afterwards. Tell your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms during or after your injection: shortness of breath; difficulty swallowing or breathing; hoarseness; swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, or eyes; hives; itching; rash; fainting; lightheadedness; dizziness; cold, clammy skin; rapid, weak pulse; slow heartbeat; headache;  nausea; vomiting; joint or muscle pain; stomach pain; pain, burning, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet; swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs; loss of consciousness; or seizures.
