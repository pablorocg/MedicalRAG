			<Question qid="0000421-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Elvitegravir, Cobicistat, Emtricitabine, and Tenofovir ?</Question>
			<Answer>Elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir should not be used to treat hepatitis B virus infection (HBV; an ongoing liver infection). Tell your doctor if you have or think you may have HBV. Your doctor may test you to see if you have HBV before you begin your treatment with elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. If you have HBV and you take elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir, your condition may suddenly worsen when you stop taking this medication. Your doctor will examine you and order lab tests regularly for several months after you stop taking this medication to see if your HBV has worsened. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests before and during your treatment to check your body's response to elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000421-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Elvitegravir, Cobicistat, Emtricitabine, and Tenofovir and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir (Genvoya, Stribilid) is used to treat  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults and children who have not been treated with other HIV medications or to replace current medication therapy in certain people already taking HIV medications. The combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir is in a class of medications called antivirals. Elvitegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir work by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Cobicistat helps to keep elvitegravir in the body longer so that the medication will have a greater effect. Although the combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir will not cure HIV, these medications may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000421-3" qtype="usage">How should Elvitegravir, Cobicistat, Emtricitabine, and Tenofovir be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food once a day. Take elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.

Do not stop taking elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000421-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Elvitegravir, Cobicistat, Emtricitabine, and Tenofovir ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
