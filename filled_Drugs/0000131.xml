			<Question qid="0000131-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Bentoquatam Topical and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Bentoquatam lotion is used to prevent poison oak, poison ivy, and poison sumac rashes in people who may come in contact with these plants. Bentoquatam is in a class of medications called skin protectants. It works by forming a coating on the skin that protects it from the plant oils that may cause a rash. Bentoquatam will not soothe or heal a rash that has already developed from contact with poison oak, poison ivy, or poison sumac.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000131-2" qtype="usage">How should Bentoquatam Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Bentoquatam comes as a lotion to apply to the skin. It is usually applied at least 15 minutes before possible contact with poison oak, poison ivy, or poison sumac, and reapplied at least once every 4 hours for as long as the risk of contact with these plants continues. Follow the directions on the package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use bentoquatam exactly as directed. Bentoquatam lotion is available without a prescription. However, you should ask a doctor before you apply bentoquatam lotion to a child who is younger than 6 years old. Shake the lotion very well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Bentoquatam lotion is only for use on the skin. Do not get bentoquatam lotion in your eyes and do not swallow the medication. If you do get bentoquatam lotion in your eyes, rinse them with plenty of water. Do not apply bentoquatam lotion to an open rash. Bentoquatam lotion may catch fire. Stay away from fires and open flames while applying the lotion and for as long as the lotion is on your skin.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000131-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Bentoquatam Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
