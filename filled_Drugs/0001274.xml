			<Question qid="0001274-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Valsartan and Sacubitril and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of valsartan and sacubitril is usually used in combination with other medications to lower the risk of death and hospitalization in adults with certain types of heart failure. The combination of valsartan and sacubitril is also used to treat certain types of heart failure in children 1 year of age and older. Valsartan is in a class of medications called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances that tighten the blood vessels, allowing the blood to flow more smoothly and the heart to pump more efficiently. Sacubitril is in a class of medications called neprilysin inhibitors. It works to help control blood volume.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001274-3" qtype="usage">How should Valsartan and Sacubitril be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of valsartan and sacubitril comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day with or without food. To help you remember to take the combination of valsartan and sacubitril, take it at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take valsartan and sacubitril exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you or your child cannot swallow the tablets, your pharmacist can prepare this medication as an oral suspension (liquid). Shake the bottle of suspension well before each dose. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of valsartan and sacubitril and gradually increase your dose. The combination of valsartan and sacubitril controls heart failure but does not cure it. Continue to take valsartan and sacubitril even if you feel well. Do not stop taking valsartan and sacubitril without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001274-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Valsartan and Sacubitril ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store the tablets at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Store the bottle of oral suspension at room temperature for up to 15 days; do not refrigerate it. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
