			<Question qid="0000018-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Acyclovir Topical and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Acyclovir cream is used to treat cold sores (fever blisters; blisters that are caused by a virus called herpes simplex) on the face or lips. Acyclovir ointment is used to treat first outbreaks of genital herpes (a herpes virus infection that causes sores to form around the genitals and rectum from time to time) and to treat certain types of sores caused by the herpes simplex virus in people with weak immune systems. Acyclovir is in a class of antiviral medications called synthetic nucleoside analogues. It works by stopping the spread of the herpes virus in the body. Acyclovir does not cure cold sores or genital herpes, does not prevent outbreaks of these conditions, and does not stop the spread of these conditions to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000018-2" qtype="usage">How should Acyclovir Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Topical acyclovir comes as a cream and an ointment to apply to the skin. Acyclovir cream is usually applied 5 times a day for 4 days. Acyclovir cream may be applied at any time during a cold sore outbreak, but it works best when it is applied at the very beginning of a cold sore outbreak, when there is tingling, redness, itching, or a bump but the cold sore has not yet formed. Acyclovir ointment is usually applied 6 times a day (usually 3 hours apart) for 7 days. It is best to begin using acyclovir ointment as soon as possible after you experience the first symptoms of infection. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use topical acyclovir exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your symptoms should improve during your treatment with topical acyclovir. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor. Acyclovir cream and ointment are for use only on the skin. Do not let acyclovir cream or ointment get into your eyes, or inside your mouth or nose, and do not swallow the medication. Acyclovir cream should only be applied to skin where a cold sore has formed or seems likely to form. Do not apply acyclovir cream to any unaffected skin, or to genital herpes sores. Do not apply other skin medications or other types of skin products such as cosmetics, sun screen, or lip balm to the cold sore area while using acyclovir cream unless your doctor tells you that you should. To use acyclovir cream, follow these steps:
 Wash your hands., Clean and dry the area of skin where you will be applying the cream., Apply a layer of cream to cover the skin where the cold sore has formed or seems likely to form., Rub the cream into the skin until it disappears., Leave the skin where you applied the medication uncovered.

Do not bathe, shower, or swim right after applying acyclovir cream., Avoid irritation of the cold sore area while using acyclovir cream.,  To use acyclovir ointment, follow these steps:
 Put on a clean finger cot or rubber glove., Apply enough ointment to cover all of your sores., Take off the finger cot or rubber glove and dispose of it safely, so that it is out of reach of children., Keep the affected area(s) clean and dry, and avoid wearing tight-fitting clothing over the affected area.,  Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient. Read this information before you start using acyclovir and each time you refill your prescription.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000018-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Acyclovir Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, with the cap on and tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Never leave this medication in your car in cold or hot weather. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
