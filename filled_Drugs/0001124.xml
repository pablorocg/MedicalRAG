			<Question qid="0001124-2" qtype="usage">How should Sodium Phosphate Rectal be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rectal sodium phosphate comes as an enema to insert in the rectum. It is usually inserted when a bowel movement is desired. The enema usually causes a bowel movement within 1 to 5 minutes. Follow the directions on the package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use rectal sodium phosphate exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed on the package label. Do not use more than one enema in 24 hours even if you have not had a bowel movement.  Using too much rectal sodium phosphate may cause serious damage to the kidneys or heart and possibly death. Rectal sodium phosphate is available in a regular- and large-size enema for adults and a small-size enema for children. Do not give the adult-size enema to a child. If you are giving the child-size enema to a child who is 2 to 5 years of age, you should give half of the contents. To prepare this dose, unscrew the cap of the bottle and remove 2 tablespoons of liquid using a measuring spoon. Then replace the bottle cap. To use the sodium phosphate enema, follow these steps:
 Remove the protective shield from the tip of the enema., Lie down on your left side and raise your right knee to your chest or kneel and lean forward until the left side of your face is resting on the floor and your left arm is comfortably folded., Gently insert the enema bottle into your rectum with the tip pointing toward your navel. While you insert the enema, bear down as though you are having a bowel movement., Squeeze the bottle gently until the bottle is nearly empty. The bottle contains extra liquid, so it does not have to be completely empty. Remove the enema bottle from your rectum., Hold the enema contents in place until you feel a strong urge to have a bowel movement. This will usually take 1 to 5 minutes, and you should not hold the enema solution for more than 10 minutes. Wash your hands after using the enema.,  Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001124-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Sodium Phosphate Rectal ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
