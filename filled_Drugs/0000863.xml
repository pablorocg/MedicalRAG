Nicotine oral inhalation should be used together with a smoking cessation program, which may include support groups, counseling, or specific behavioral change techniques.

			<Question qid="0000863-2" qtype="usage">How should Nicotine Oral Inhalation be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nicotine oral inhalation comes as a cartridge to inhale by mouth using a special inhaler. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nicotine oral inhalation exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Follow your doctor's instructions about how many nicotine cartridges you should use each day. Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose depending on your urge to smoke. After you have used nicotine inhalation for 12 weeks and your body adjusts to not smoking, your doctor may decrease your dose gradually over the next 6 to 12 weeks until you are not using nicotine inhalation any more. Follow your doctor's instructions for how to decrease your nicotine dose. The nicotine in the cartridges is released by frequent puffing over 20 minutes. You may use up a cartridge all at once or puff on it for a few minutes at a time until the nicotine is finished. You may want to try different schedules to see what works best for you. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient. Read the directions for how to use the inhaler and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you the proper technique. Practice using the inhaler while in his or her presence. If you have not stopped smoking at the end of 4 weeks, talk to your doctor. Your doctor can try to help you understand why you were not able to stop smoking and make plans to try again.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000863-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Nicotine Oral Inhalation ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep all the parts of the nicotine inhaler and used and unused nicotine cartridges out of the reach of children and pets. Store the mouthpiece in the plastic storage case. Store the cartridges at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
