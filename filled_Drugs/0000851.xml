			<Question qid="0000851-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Nelfinavir and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nelfinavir is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Nelfinavir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although nelfinavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000851-2" qtype="usage">How should Nelfinavir be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nelfinavir comes as a tablet and a powder to take by mouth. It is usually taken two to three times a day with food. Take nelfinavir at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take nelfinavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you are unable to swallow the tablet, you may put it in a glass and dissolve it in a small amount of water. Mix the liquid well, and drink it immediately. Rinse the glass with more water and swallow the entire mixture to make sure you have taken all of the medication. Nelfinavir oral powder may be added to water, milk, formula, soy milk, or dietary supplements. Mix well, and drink all of the liquid right away in order to take the full dose. Your prescription label tells you how many scoops of nelfinavir powder to add to the liquid. If the mixture is not taken immediately it must be stored in the refrigerator and taken within 6 hours. Do not mix nelfinavir oral powder with acidic food or juice (orange juice, apple juice, or apple sauce). Do not mix nelfinavir with water in the original container. Nelfinavir controls HIV infection but does not cure it. Continue to take nelfinavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking nelfinavir without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking nelfinavir or skip doses, your infection may get worse or become resistant to medications. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. Many other medications may also interact with nelfinavir, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list., if you are taking didanosine (Videx), take it 1 hour before or more than 2 hours after nelfinavir., tell your doctor if you are taking birth control pills.

Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms while you are taking nelfinavir: extreme thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, blurred vision, or weakness. It is very important to call your doctor as soon as you have any of these symptoms, because high blood sugar that is not treated can cause a serious condition called ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis may become life-threatening if it is not treated at an early stage. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include dry mouth, nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath, breath that smells fruity, and decreased consciousness., if you have phenylketonuria (PKU, an inherited condition in which a special diet must be followed to prevent damage to your brain that can cause severe intellectual disability), you should know that nelfinavir oral powder is sweetened with aspartame that forms phenylalanine., you should know that while you are taking medications to treat HIV infection, your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight other infections that were already in your body. This may cause you to develop symptoms of those infections. If you have new or worsening symptoms at any time during your treatment with nelfinavir, be sure to tell your doctor., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000851-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Nelfinavir ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). After nelfinavir powder has been added to liquid, the mixture may be kept at room temperature for up to 6 hours. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
