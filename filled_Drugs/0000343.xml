			<Question qid="0000343-2" qtype="usage">How should Desoximetasone Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Desoximetasone comes as a cream, ointment, gel, and spray to apply to the skin. It is usually applied twice a day. Apply it at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use desoximetasone exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply it to other areas of your body or use it to treat other skin conditions unless directed to do so by your doctor. Your skin condition should improve during the first 4 weeks of your treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during this time. To use desoximetasone, apply a small amount of ointment, cream, spray, or gel to cover the affected area of skin with a thin even film and rub it in gently. Be sure to wash your hands immediately afterwards. This medication is only for use on the skin. Do not let desoximetasone topical get into your eyes or mouth and do not swallow it. Avoid use in the genital and rectal areas and in skin creases and armpits unless directed by your doctor. Desoximetasone spray may catch fire. Stay away from open fire, flames, and do not smoke while you are applying betamethasone foam, and for a short time afterward. If you are applying desoximetasone to a child's diaper area, do not cover the area with tight fitting diapers or plastic pants. This medication is only for use on the skin. Do not let desoximetasone topical get into your eyes or mouth and do not swallow it. Avoid use on the face, in the genital and rectal areas, and in skin creases and armpits unless directed by your doctor. Do not wrap or bandage the treated area unless your doctor tells you that you should. Such use may increase side effects. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000343-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Desoximetasone Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
