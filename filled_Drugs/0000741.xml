			<Question qid="0000741-2" qtype="usage">How should Mechlorethamine Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Topical mechlorethamine comes as a gel to apply to the skin. It is usually applied once a day. Apply mechlorethamine gel at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Apply mechlorethamine gel exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling while you are using mechlorethamine gel. Your doctor may stop the medication for a time or tell you to apply mechlorethamine gel less often if you experience serious side effects. Your skin must be completely dry when applying mechlorethamine gel. You should wait at least 30 minutes after washing or showering before applying mechlorethamine gel. After you apply the medication, do not wash or shower for at least 4 hours. Moisturizers may be applied at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after using mechlorethamine gel. Apply mechlorethamine gel within 30 minutes after you take it out of the refrigerator. Return mechlorethamine gel to the refrigerator right after each use. It is important to store your medication properly so that it will work as expected. Talk with your pharmacist before using mechlorethamine gel that has been out of the refrigerator for more than 1 hour a day. Apply a thin layer of mechlorethamine gel to affected skin. Let the treated area dry for 5 to 10 minutes before covering with clothing. Do not use air or water-tight bandages on the treated areas. Wash your hands well with soap and water after applying or touching mechlorethamine gel. If a caregiver applies the medication to your skin, he or she must wear disposable nitrile gloves and wash hands well with soap and water after removing the gloves. If a caregiver accidentally comes in contact with mechlorethamine gel, he or she must immediately wash the exposed area thoroughly with soap and water for at least 15 minutes and remove any contaminated clothing. Mechlorethamine gel should only be used on the skin. Keep mechlorethamine gel away from your eyes, nose, and mouth. If mechlorethamine gel gets in your eyes, it can cause eye pain, burning, swelling, redness, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. It may also cause blindness and permanent injury to your eyes. If mechlorethamine gel gets in your eyes, rinse your eyes right away for at least 15 minutes with a large amount of water, saline, or an eye wash solution and get emergency medical help. If mechlorethamine gel gets in your nose or mouth it can cause pain, redness, and ulcers. Rinse the affected area right away for at least 15 minutes with a large amount of water and get emergency medical help. Before you start your treatment with mechlorethamine gel, talk with your healthcare provider about how to get medical help quickly if the gel gets in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Mechlorethamine gel may catch fire. Stay away from any source of heat or open flame and do not smoke while you are applying the medication and until it is completely dry. Unused mechlorethamine gel, empty tubes, and used application gloves should be disposed of safely, out of the reach of children and pets. Mechlorethamine gel is not available in pharmacies. You can only get mechlorethamine gel through the mail from a specialty pharmacy. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about receiving your medication.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000741-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Mechlorethamine Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the original box, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store mechlorethamine gel in the refrigerator away from any food. Dispose of any mechlorethamine gel that is not used after 60 days. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
