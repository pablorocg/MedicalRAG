			<Question qid="0000908-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Oritavancin Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Oritavancin injection is used to treat skin infections caused by certain types of bacteria. Oritavancin is in a class of medications called lipoglycopeptide antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as oritavancin will not work for colds, flu, and other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>
