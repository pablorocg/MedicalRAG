			<Question qid="0001067-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Rilpivirine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rilpivirine is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in certain adults and children 12 years of age and older who weigh at least 77 lb (35 kg) and have not received antiretroviral treatment in the past. It is also used along with cabotegravir (Vocabria) as a short-term treatment of HIV-1 infection in certain adults. Rilpivirine is in a class of medications called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although rilpivirine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001067-2" qtype="usage">How should Rilpivirine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rilpivirine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with a meal (not just a protein drink) once a day.  When rilpivirine is taken along with cabotegravir, it is usually taken once daily with a meal. Take rilpivirine alone or along with cabotegravir at around the same time every day. Rilpivirine is taken along with cabotegravir for about one month (for at least 28 days) prior to starting treatment with the long-acting injectable forms of these medications or for up to 2 months if the injectable treatment schedule is missed for more than 7 days. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rilpivirine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Rilpivirine controls HIV but does not cure it. Continue to take rilpivirine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking rilpivirine without talking to your doctor. When your supply of rilpivirine starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. If you miss doses or stop taking rilpivirine, your condition may become more difficult to treat. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001067-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Rilpivirine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
