			<Question qid="0000846-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Nebivolol and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nebivolol is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Nebivolol is in a class of medications called beta blockers. It works by relaxing blood vessels and slowing heart rate to improve blood flow and decrease blood pressure. High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000846-2" qtype="usage">How should Nebivolol be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nebivolol comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day. To help you remember to take nebivolol, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take nebivolol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of nebivolol and gradually increase your dose not more than once every 2 weeks. Talk to your doctor about how you feel and about any symptoms you experience during this time. Nebivolol controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. It may take 2 weeks before the full benefit of nebivolol is seen in blood pressure readings. Continue to take nebivolol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking nebivolol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking nebivolol it may cause angina (chest pain), heart attack, or irregular heartbeat. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually over 1 to 2 weeks. Your doctor will watch you carefully and will probably tell you to avoid physical activity during this time.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000846-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Nebivolol ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
