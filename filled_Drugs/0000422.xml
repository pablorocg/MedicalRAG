			<Question qid="0000422-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Empagliflozin and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Empagliflozin is used along with diet and exercise, and sometimes with other medications, to lower blood sugar levels in adults and children 10 years of age and older with type 2 diabetes (condition in which blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally). Empagliflozin is also used to reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack, or death in people who have type 2 diabetes along with heart and blood vessel disease. Empagliflozin is also used in adults with heart failure to reduce the risk of needing to be hospitalized and death due to heart and blood vessel disease.  It is also used to reduce the risk of worsening kidney disease, the need to be hospitalized, and the risk of death due to heart disease in adults with kidney disease. Empagliflozin is in a class of medications called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. It lowers blood sugar by causing the kidneys to get rid of more glucose in the urine. Empagliflozin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may develop if high blood sugar is not treated). Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking empagliflozin, making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000422-2" qtype="usage">How should Empagliflozin be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Empagliflozin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day in the morning with or without food. Take empagliflozin at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take empagliflozin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of empagliflozin and increase your dose as needed. Empagliflozin helps to control your condition, but does not cure it. Continue to take empagliflozin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking empagliflozin without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000422-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Empagliflozin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000422-10" qtype="other information">What other information should I know about Empagliflozin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will probably order certain laboratory tests before and during your treatment to check your body's response to empagliflozin. Your blood sugar levels should be checked regularly to determine your response to empagliflozin. Your doctor will order other lab tests, including glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), to check your response to empagliflozin. Your doctor will also tell you how to check your response to this medication by measuring your blood sugar levels at home. Follow these instructions carefully. Before having any laboratory test, tell your doctor and the laboratory personnel that you are taking empagliflozin. Because of the way this medication works, your urine may test positive for glucose. You should always wear a diabetic identification bracelet to be sure you get proper treatment in an emergency. Do not let anyone else take your medication.

It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements.
