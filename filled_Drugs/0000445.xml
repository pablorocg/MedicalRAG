			<Question qid="0000445-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Erythromycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store Benzamycin Gel in the refrigerator but do not freeze it. If you forget to refrigerate the gel for 1 day, you may refrigerate it when you remember and continue to use it. Store Benzamycin Pak at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Dispose of any unused Benzamycin Gel after 3 months. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
