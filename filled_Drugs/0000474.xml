			<Question qid="0000474-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Evolocumab Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Evolocumab injection is used to reduce the risk of a stroke or heart attack or the need for coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery in people with cardiovascular disease. Evolocumab injection is also used along with diet alone or in combination with other cholesterol-lowering medications such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) or ezetimbe (Zetia) to decrease the amount of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') in the blood, including people who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (HeFH; an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). It is also used along with diet changes and other treatments to reduce the amount low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol')in the blood in people that have homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH; an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Evolocumab injection is in a class of medications called proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor monoclonal antibody. It works by blocking the production of LDL cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Accumulation of cholesterol along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000474-2" qtype="usage">How should Evolocumab Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Evolocumab injection comes as a solution (liquid) in a prefilled syringe, a prefilled autoinjector, and in an on-body infusor with a prefilled cartridge to inject subcutaneously (just under the skin). When evolocumab injection is used to treat HeFH or cardiovascular disease or to reduce the risk of a stroke, heart attack, and coronary artery bypass surgery, it is usually injected every 2 weeks or once every month. When evolocumab injection is used to treat HoFH, it is usually injected once every month. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use evolocumab injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of this medication or use it more often or for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor. If you are using evolocumab injection once every month (420 mg dose), inject it once over 9 minutes with the on-body infusor and prefilled cartridge for each injection or inject 3 separate injections one after the other within 30 minutes, using a different prefilled syringe or prefilled autoinjector for each injection. Evolocumab injection helps to control cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of a stroke, heart attack, or coronary artery bypass surgery, but it does not cure these conditions or eliminate these risks. Continue to use evolocumab injection even if you feel well. Do not stop using evolocumab injection without talking to your doctor. Evolocumab injection comes in a prefilled autoinjector, prefilled syringes, and in an infusor with a prefilled cartridge that contain enough medication for one dose. Always inject evolocumab in its own prefilled autoinjector, syringe, or infusor with a prefilled cartridge; never mix it with any other medication. Dispose of used needles, syringes, and devices in a puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container. You can inject evolocumab injection under the skin on your thighs or stomach area, except for the 2-inch area around your navel (belly button). If someone else will be injecting the medication for you, that person can also inject it into your upper arm. Use a different spot for each injection. Do not inject evolocumab injection into a spot that is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Also, do not inject into areas with scars or stretch marks. Carefully read the manufacturer's instructions for use that comes with the medication. These instructions describe how to inject a dose of evolocumab injection. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you or the person who will be injecting have any questions about how to inject this medication. See  Instructions for Use  from the manufacturer at  https://bit.ly/3jTG7cx . Remove the prefilled syringe or prefilled autoinjector from the refrigerator and allow it to warm to room temperature for 30 minutes before using it. Remove the infusor with a prefilled cartridge from the refrigerator and allow it to warm to room temperature for 45 minutes before using it. Do not warm evolocumab injection in hot water, microwave, or place it in sunlight. Before you use evolocumab injection, look at the solution closely. The medication should be clear to pale yellow and free of floating particles. Do not shake the prefilled syringe, prefilled autoinjector, or infusor with a prefilled cartridge containing evolocumab injection.</Answer>
