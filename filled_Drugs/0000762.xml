			<Answer>Rectal mesalamine is used to treat ulcerative colitis (a condition which causes swelling and sores in the lining of the colon [large intestine] and rectum), proctitis (swelling in the rectum), and proctosigmoiditis (swelling in the rectum and sigmoid colon [last section of the colon]). Rectal mesalamine is in a class of medications called anti-inflammatory agents. It works by stopping the body from producing a certain substance that may cause inflammation.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000762-2" qtype="usage">How should Mesalamine Rectal be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rectal mesalamine comes as a suppository and an enema to use in the rectum. The suppository and the enema are usually used once a day at bedtime. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use rectal mesalamine exactly as directed. Do not use it more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You should begin to feel better during the first few days or weeks of your treatment with rectal mesalamine. Continue to use rectal mesalamine until you finish your prescription, even if you feel better at the beginning of your treatment. Do not stop using rectal mesalamine without talking to your doctor. Mesalamine suppositories and enemas may stain clothing and other fabrics, flooring, and painted, marble, granite, enamel, vinyl, and other surfaces. Take precautions to prevent staining when you use these medications. Drink plenty of fluids while using mesalamine suppositories and enemas. If using a mesalamine enema, follow these steps:
 Try to have a bowel movement. The medication will work best if your bowels are empty., Use scissors to cut the seal of the protective foil pouch that holds seven bottles of medication. Be careful not to squeeze or cut the bottles. Remove one bottle from the pouch., Look at the liquid inside the bottle. It should be off-white or tan colored. The liquid may darken slightly if the bottles are left out of the foil pouch for a time. You may use liquid that has darkened a little bit, but do not use liquid that is dark brown., Shake the bottle well to make sure the medication is mixed., Remove the protective cover from the applicator tip. Be careful to hold the bottle by the neck so that the medication will not leak out of the bottle., Lie on your left side with your lower (left) leg straight and your right leg bent toward your chest for balance. You can also kneel on a bed, resting your upper chest and one arm on the bed., Gently insert the applicator tip into your rectum, pointing it slightly toward your navel (belly button)., Hold the bottle firmly and tilt it slightly so that the nozzle is aimed toward your back. Squeeze the bottle slowly and steadily to release the medicine., Withdraw the applicator. Remain in the same position for at least 30 minutes to allow the medicine to spread through your intestine. Try to keep the medicine inside of your body for about 8 hours (while you sleep)., Dispose of the bottle safely, so that is out of the reach of children and pets. Each bottle contains only one dose and should not be reused.,  If using a mesalamine suppository, follow these steps:
 Try to have a bowel movement just before using the suppository. The medication will work best if your bowels are empty., Separate one suppository from the strip of suppositories. Hold the suppository upright and use your fingers to peel off the plastic wrapper. Try to handle the suppository as little as possible to avoid melting it with the heat of your hands., Lie down on your left side and raise your right knee to your chest. (If you are left-handed, lie on your right side and raise your left knee.), Using your finger, insert the suppository into the rectum, pointed end first. Use gentle pressure to insert the suppository completely. Try to keep it in place for 1 to 3 hours or longer if possible., Wash your hands thoroughly before you resume your normal activities.,  If you will be using mesalamine enemas or suppositories, ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient that comes with the medication.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000762-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Mesalamine Rectal ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). You may store mesalamine suppositories in the refrigerator. Once you open the foil package of mesalamine enemas use all the bottles promptly, as directed by your doctor. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
