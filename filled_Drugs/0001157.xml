			<Question qid="0001157-2" qtype="usage">How should Talimogene Laherparepvec Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Talimogene laherparepvec injection comes as a suspension (liquid) to be injected by a doctor or nurse in a medical office. Your doctor will inject the medicine directly into tumors that are on your skin, just below your skin, or in your lymph nodes. You will receive a second treatment 3 weeks after the first treatment, and then every 2 weeks afterwards. The length of treatment depends on how well your tumors respond to treatment. Your doctor may not inject all of the tumors at each visit. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with talimogene laherparepvec and each time you receive the injections. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>
