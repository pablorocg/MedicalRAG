If a doctor has told you before that you had a yeast infection and you have the same symptoms again, use the vaginal cream or suppositories as directed on the package. Do not have vaginal intercourse or use other vaginal products (such as tampons, douches, or spermicides) during your treatment. You should begin to feel better during the first three days of treatment with miconazole. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.

			<Question qid="0000796-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Miconazole ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program.

See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
