			<Question qid="0001208-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Tigecycline Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>In clinical studies, more patients who were treated with tigecycline injection for serious infections died than patients who were treated with other medications for serious infections. These people died because their infections worsened, because they developed complications of their infections, or because of other medical conditions they had. There is not enough information to tell whether using tigecycline injection increases the risk of death during treatment. Your doctor will only treat you with tigecycline injection if other medication cannot be used to treat your infection. Talk to your doctor about the risk of using tigecycline injection.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001208-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Tigecycline Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tigecycline injection used to treat certain serious infections including community acquired pneumonia (a lung infection that developed in a person who was not in the hospital), skin infections, and infections of the abdomen (area between the chest and the waist). Tigecycline injection should not be used to treat pneumonia that developed in people who are on ventilators or who were in a hospital or foot infections in people who have diabetes. Tigecycline injection is in a class of medications called tetracycline antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria that cause infection. Antibiotics such as tigecycline injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001208-3" qtype="usage">How should Tigecycline Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tigecycline injection comes as a powder to be mixed with fluid and injected into a vein. It is usually infused (injected slowly) intravenously (into a vein) over a period of 30 to 60 minutes, once every 12 hours. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have and how your body responds to the medication. You may receive tigecycline injection in a hospital or you may use the medication at home. If you will be using tigecycline injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to infuse the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Ask your healthcare provider what to do if you have any problems infusing tigecycline injection. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with tigecycline injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Use tigecycline injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using tigecycline injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>
