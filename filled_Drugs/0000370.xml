			<Question qid="0000370-3" qtype="usage">How should Dihydroergotamine Injection and Nasal Spray be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dihydroergotamine comes as a solution to inject subcutaneously (under the skin), intramuscularly (in the muscle), or intravenouslyly (into a vein). Dihydroergotamine can be given subcutaneously at home to treat a migraine headache or given intramuscularly or intravenously at a doctor's office or hospital to treat a migraine or cluster headache. Additional dose(s) can be given every hour if headache continues but no more than 3 total doses should be given subcutaneously or intramuscularly or more than 2 total doses intravenously in a 24-hour period of time.  Dihdroergotamine should not be used daily and no more than 6 doses should be given in 1 week.  Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use dihydroergotamine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Dihydroergotamine can damage the heart and other organs if it is used too often. Dihydroergotamine should be used only to treat a migraine that is in progress. Do not use dihydroergotamine to prevent a migraine from beginning or to treat a headache that feels different than your usual migraine.  You may receive your first dose of dihydroergotamine in your doctor's office so that your doctor can monitor your reaction to the medication and be sure that you know how to use the nasal spray or administer the injection correctly. After that, you may inject dihydroergotamine at home.  Be sure that you and anyone who will be helping you inject the medication read the manufacturer's information for the patient that comes with dihydroergotamine before using it for the first time at home.  If you are using the solution for injection, you should never reuse syringes. Dispose of syringes in a puncture resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture resistant container. To use the solution for injection, follow these steps:
 Check your ampule to be sure it is safe to use. Do not use the ampule if it is broken, cracked, labeled with an expiration date that has passed, or contains a colored, cloudy, or particle-filled liquid. Return that ampule to the pharmacy and use a different ampule., Wash your hands well with soap and water., Check to be sure all the liquid is at the bottom of ampule. If any liquid is at the top of the ampule, gently flick it with your finger until it falls to the bottom., Hold the bottom of the ampule in one hand. Hold the top of the ampule between the thumb and pointer of your other hand. Your thumb should be over the dot on the top of the ampule. Push the top of the ampule backward with your thumb until it breaks off. , Tilt the ampule at a 45-degree angle and insert the needle into the ampule., Pull back the plunger slowly and steadily until the top of the plunger is even with the dose your doctor told you to inject., Hold the syringe with the needle pointing upward and check if it contains air bubbles. If the syringe does contain air bubbles, tap it with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top. Then slowly push the plunger up until you see a drop of medication at the tip of the needle., Check the syringe to be sure it contains the correct dose, especially if you had to remove air bubbles. If the syringe does not contain the correct dose, repeat steps 5 to 7., Choose a spot to inject the medication on either thigh, well above the knee. Wipe the area with an alcohol swab using a firm, circular motion, and allow it to dry., Hold the syringe with one hand and hold a fold of skin around the injection site with the other hand. Push the needle all the way into the skin at a 45- to 90-degree angle., Keep the needle inside the skin, and pull back slightly on the plunger., If blood appears in the syringe, pull the needle slightly out of the skin and repeat step 11., Push the plunger all the way down to inject the medication., Pull the needle quickly out of the skin at the same angle you inserted it., Press a new alcohol pad on the injection site and rub it., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000370-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Dihydroergotamine Injection and Nasal Spray ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not refrigerate or freeze. Dispose of unused medication for injection 1 hour after you open the ampule. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
