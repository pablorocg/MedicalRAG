			<Question qid="0000477-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Ezetimibe and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ezetimibe is used along with diet, alone or in combination with another cholesterol-lowering medications (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors [statins]) to reduce the amount of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') in the blood in adults and children 10 years of age or older who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally).  It is also used along with diet, alone or in combination with other cholesterol-lowering medications (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors [statins] or fenofibrate) in adults who have too many fats in the blood. Ezetimibe is also used with other medications to reduce the amount of LDL cholesterol in the blood in adults and children 10 years of age or older who have homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH; an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). It is also used to reduce the amount of other fatty substances in the blood in adults and children 9 years of age or older who have homozygous familial sitosterolemia (an inherited condition in which fatty substances from vegetable oils, nuts, and other plant-based foods cannot be removed from the body normally). Ezetimibe is in a class of medications called cholesterol-lowering medications. It works by preventing the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine. Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats may help prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000477-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Ezetimibe ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
