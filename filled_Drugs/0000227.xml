			<Question qid="0000227-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Ceritinib and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ceritinib is used to treat a certain type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to  other parts of the body. Ceritinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000227-2" qtype="usage">How should Ceritinib be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ceritinib comes as a capsule and a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food  once a day. Take ceritinib at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ceritinib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you vomit after taking ceritinib, do not take another dose. Continue your regular dosing schedule. Your doctor may decrease your dose of ceritinib, treat you with other medications, or tell you to stop taking ceritinib for a period of time during your treatment. This will depend on how well the medication works for you and any side effects you may experience. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with ceritinib.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000227-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Ceritinib ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
