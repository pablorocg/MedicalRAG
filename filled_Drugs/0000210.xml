			<Question qid="0000210-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Cefepime Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cefepime injection is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria including pneumonia, and skin, urinary tract, and kidney infections. Cefepime injection is used in combination with metronidazole (Flagyl) to treat abdominal (stomach area) infections. Cefepime injection is also used to treat patients who have fever and are at high risk for infection because they have a low number of white blood cells. Cefepime injection is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as cefepime injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000210-2" qtype="usage">How should Cefepime Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cefepime injection comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid, or as a premixed product, to be injected intravenously (into a vein) over a period of 30 minutes. Cefepime injection can also be given intramuscularly (into a muscle). It is usually given every 8 or 12 hours for 7 to 10 days. You may receive cefepime injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you will be receiving cefepime injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with cefepime injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Use cefepime injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using cefepime injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>
