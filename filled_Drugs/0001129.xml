			<Question qid="0001129-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Sonidegib ?</Question>
			<Answer>For all patients: Sonidegib should not be taken by women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant. There is a high risk that sonidegib will cause loss of the pregnancy or will cause the baby to be born with birth defects (physical problems that are present at birth). Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with sonidegib and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or visit the manufacturer's web site to obtain the Medication Guide. Do not donate blood or blood products while you are taking sonidegib and for at least 20 months after your treatment. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking sonidegib. For female patients: If you can become pregnant, you will need to avoid becoming pregnant during your treatment with sonidegib. You must have a negative pregnancy test before the start of your treatment. You must use acceptable forms of birth control during your treatment and for at least 20 months after your treatment is completed. Your doctor will tell you which forms of birth control are acceptable. If you think you are pregnant, miss a menstrual period, or have sex without using birth control while taking sonidegib or within 20 months after your treatment, call your doctor immediately. For male patients: You must use a condom, even if you have had a vasectomy (surgery to prevent sperm from leaving your body and causing pregnancy), every time you have sexual contact with a female who is pregnant or able to become pregnant while you are taking sonidegib, and for at least 8 months after your treatment. Tell your doctor immediately if you have had unprotected sex with a woman who can become pregnant or if you think for any reason that your partner is pregnant. Do not donate semen while you are taking sonidegib or within 8 months after your treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001129-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Sonidegib and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Sonidegib is used to treat basal cell carcinoma (BCC; a type of skin cancer) in adults with cancer that has come back after surgery or radiation, or in adults that cannot be treated with surgery or radiation. Sonidegib is in a class of medications called hedgehog pathway inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of a protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop or slow the spread of cancer cells and may help shrink tumors.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001129-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Sonidegib ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
