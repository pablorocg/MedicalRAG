			<Question qid="0001108-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Sevelamer and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Sevelamer is used to control high blood levels of phosphorus in people with chronic kidney disease who are on dialysis (medical treatment to clean the blood when the kidneys are not working properly). Sevelamer is in a class of medications called phosphate binders. It binds phosphorus that you get from foods in your diet and prevents it from being absorbed into your blood stream.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001108-2" qtype="usage">How should Sevelamer be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Sevelamer comes as a tablet and as a powder for suspension to take by mouth. It is usually taken three times a day with meals. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take sevelamer exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not break or crush the tablets. Your doctor will probably adjust your dose based on your phosphorus blood levels, not more often than once every 2 weeks. If you are taking the powder for suspension, carefully read the manufacturer's instructions for use that come with the medication. These instructions describe how to prepare and measure your dose. Mix the powder with the recommended amount of water for your dose and stir the mixture vigorously. The mixture will be cloudy as the powder does not dissolve. Alternatively, you can mix the powder with a food or beverage. Do not microwave the mixture or add the powder to heated foods or liquids. Take the mixture immediately after preparation (within 30 minutes), as part of your meal. If the mixture is not taken within 30 minutes of preparing it, dispose of the mixture.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001108-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Sevelamer ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
