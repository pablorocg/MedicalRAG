What is Honey ?,0000049-1,information,"Honey is a thick, sweet fluid produced by bees from plant nectars. It is commonly used as a sweetener in food, but should be avoided in infants. Some chemicals in honey might kill certain bacteria and fungus. When applied to the skin, honey might serve as a barrier to moisture and keep skin from sticking to wound dressings. It might also provide nutrients and chemicals that speed wound healing. But honey can become contaminated with germs during production. Although rare, some infants have gotten botulism from taking honey by mouth.  People commonly use honey for burns, wound healing, swelling and sores inside the mouth, and cough. It is also used for many other conditions but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses. There is also no good evidence to support using honey for COVID-19.

What is Zinc ?,0000098-1,information,"Zinc is an essential trace element commonly found in red meat, poultry, and fish. It is necessary in small amounts for human health, growth, and sense of taste. Zinc is found throughout the body. The body doesn't store excess zinc, so it must be obtained from the diet. It's needed for immune function, wound healing, blood clotting, thyroid function, and much more. It also plays a key role in maintaining vision and might have effects against viruses.  People commonly use zinc for zinc deficiency, diarrhea, and Wilson disease. Zinc is also used for acne, diabetes, anorexia, burns, and many other purposes. There is some scientific evidence to support its use for some of these conditions. But for most, there is no good scientific evidence to support its use. There is also no good evidence to support using zinc for COVID-19. ",Zinc,0000098,MPlusHerbsSupplements,https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/982.html,,,

Are there interactions between Zinc and herbs and supplements ?,0000098-6,interactions with herbs and supplements,"Beta-carotene High doses of zinc can lower beta-carotene blood levels. Bromelain Zinc might reduce the effects of bromelain. But this isn't likely to be a big concern. Calcium Calcium supplements might decrease how much zinc the body absorbs from food. This usually doesn't seem to be much of a problem. But this interaction can be avoided by taking calcium supplements at bedtime instead of with meals. Chromium Taking chromium and zinc together can reduce the absorption of both chromium and zinc. This is probably not a big concern with usual doses of zinc and chromium. Coffee Taking zinc with coffee can reduce how much zinc the body absorbs. Copper Large amounts of zinc can reduce copper absorption. Taking zinc in high doses can cause copper deficiency and anemia. Some signs of copper deficiency have also occurred in people taking zinc in doses of 150 mg daily or more for 2 years. EDTA EDTA is a chemical compound that is given to people to remove excess metals from the body, especially lead. Repeated high doses of EDTA, as used in chelation treatment, can reduce blood zinc levels by up to 40%. People receiving chelation therapy should be monitored for zinc deficiency. Folic acid Folic acid supplements can change the absorption of zinc from food. But normal supplemental doses of folic acid are not likely to affect zinc levels in people with adequate dietary zinc intake. IP-6 (Phytic acid) Phytic acid found naturally in foods can bind zinc and reduce how much is absorbed by the body. Avoid IP-6 supplements, which contain phytic acid, if you have other risk factors for zinc deficiency. Iron Iron and zinc can interfere with each other's absorption. To avoid this effect, take these supplements with food. Magnesium High doses of zinc supplements (142 mg/day), or high zinc intake from foods (53mg/day), seems to decrease magnesium levels. But it isn't clear if this is a big concern. Manganese Research suggests zinc supplements can increase the amount of manganese absorbed from supplements. Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) Research suggests riboflavin can improve zinc absorption. The importance of this isn't known. Vitamin A Zinc supplements can increase blood levels of vitamin A. Zinc might increase the effects and side effects of vitamin A.

It has less evidence for insomnia and anxiety.  5-HTP is a chemical byproduct of the protein building block L-tryptophan. It is produced commercially from the seeds of an African plant known as Griffonia simplicifolia. 5-HTP works in the brain and central nervous system by increasing the production of the chemical serotonin. Serotonin can affect sleep, appetite, temperature, sexual behavior, and pain sensation.  Since 5-HTP increases serotonin levels, it is used for conditions in which serotonin is believed to play an important role. These include depression, anxiety, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.
