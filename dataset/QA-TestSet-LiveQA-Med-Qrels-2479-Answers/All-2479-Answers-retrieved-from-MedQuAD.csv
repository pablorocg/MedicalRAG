Answer: PCOS is linked to changes in hormone levels that make it harder for the ovaries to release fully-grown (mature) eggs. The reasons for these changes are unclear. The hormones affected are:  - Estrogen and progesterone, the female hormones that help a woman's ovaries release eggs   - Androgen, a male hormone that is found in small amounts in women   Normally, one or more eggs are released during a woman's cycle. This is known as ovulation. In most cases, this release of eggs occurs about 2 weeks after the start of a menstrual period.   In PCOS, mature eggs are not released. Instead, they stay in the ovaries with a small amount of fluid around them. There can be many of these. However, not all women with the condition will have ovaries with this appearance.   These problems with the release of eggs can contribute to infertility. The other symptoms of this disorder are due to thehormoneimbalances.  Most of the time, PCOS is diagnosed in women in their 20s or 30s. However, it may also affect teenage girls. The symptoms often begin when a girl's periods start. Women with this disorder often have a mother or sister who has similar symptoms.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001656.htm
Answer: Noonan syndrome is linked to defects in several genes. Certain proteins involved in growth and development become overactive as a result of these gene changes.  Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition. This means only one parent has to pass down the nonworking gene for the child to have the syndrome. However, some cases may not be inherited.)

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.)

Answer: How is Noonan syndrome inherited? Noonan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause the condition. Each child of a person with Noonan syndrome has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the condition. In some cases, the condition is inherited from an affected parent. Because the features of the condition can vary and may be very subtle, many affected adults are diagnosed only after the birth of a more obviously affected infant. In other cases, the condition is caused by a new mutation occurring for the first time in the affected person.)

Answer: How might Noonan syndrome be treated? Management generally focuses on the specific signs and symptoms present in each person. Treatments for the complications of Noonan syndrome (such as cardiovascular abnormalities) are generally standard and do not differ from treatment in the general population. Developmental disabilities are addressed by early intervention programs and individualized education strategies. Treatment for serious bleeding depends upon the specific factor deficiency or platelet abnormality. Growth hormone treatment increases growth velocity.

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/polycystic-kidney-disease
Answer: Polycystic kidney disease is a disorder that affects the kidneys and other organs. Clusters of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, develop in the kidneys and interfere with their ability to filter waste products from the blood. The growth of cysts causes the kidneys to become enlarged and can lead to kidney failure. Cysts may also develop in other organs, particularly the liver.  Frequent complications of polycystic kidney disease include dangerously high blood pressure (hypertension), pain in the back or sides, blood in the urine (hematuria), recurrent urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and heart valve abnormalities. Additionally, people with polycystic kidney disease have an increased risk of an abnormal bulging (an aneurysm) in a large blood vessel called the aorta or in blood vessels at the base of the brain. Aneurysms can be life-threatening if they tear or rupture.  The two major forms of polycystic kidney disease are distinguished by the usual age of onset and the pattern in which it is passed through families. The autosomal dominant form (sometimes called ADPKD) has signs and symptoms that typically begin in adulthood, although cysts in the kidney are often present from birth or childhood. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease can be further divided into type 1 and type 2, depending on the genetic cause. The autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease (sometimes called ARPKD) is much rarer and is often lethal early in life. The signs and symptoms of this condition are usually apparent at birth or in early infancy.)

GHR_0000804_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to polycystic kidney disease ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/polycystic-kidney-disease
Answer: Mutations in the PKD1, PKD2, and PKHD1 genes cause polycystic kidney disease.  Mutations in either the PKD1 or PKD2 gene can cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; PKD1 gene mutations cause ADPKD type 1, and PKD2 gene mutations cause ADPKD type 2. These genes provide instructions for making proteins whose functions are not fully understood. Researchers believe that they are involved in transmitting chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. The two proteins work together to promote normal kidney development, organization, and function. Mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene lead to the formation of thousands of cysts, which disrupt the normal functions of the kidneys and other organs. People with mutations in the PKD2 gene, particularly women, typically have a less severe form of the disease than people with PKD1 mutations. The signs and symptoms, including a decline in kidney function, tend to appear later in adulthood in people with a PKD2 mutation.  Mutations in the PKHD1 gene cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. This gene provides instructions for making a protein whose exact function is unknown; however, the protein likely transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell nucleus. Researchers have not determined how mutations in the PKHD1 gene lead to the formation of numerous cysts characteristic of polycystic kidney disease.  Although polycystic kidney disease is usually a genetic disorder, a small percentage of cases are not caused by gene mutations. These cases are called acquired polycystic kidney disease. This form of the disorder occurs most often in people with other types of kidney disease who have been treated for several years with hemodialysis (a procedure that filters waste products from the blood).)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/polycystic-kidney-disease
Answer: Most cases of polycystic kidney disease have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. People with this condition are born with one mutated copy of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene in each cell. In about 90 percent of these cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. The other 10 percent of cases result from a new mutation in one of the genes and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  Although one altered copy of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder, an additional mutation in the second copy of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene may make cysts grow faster and increase the severity of the disease. The rate at which cysts enlarge and cause a loss of kidney function varies widely, and may be influenced by mutations in other genes that have not been identified.  Polycystic kidney disease also can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. People with this form of the condition have two altered copies of the PKHD1 gene in each cell. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.)

ADAM_0000719_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Celiac disease - nutritional considerations ? (Also called: Gluten-free diet; Gluten sensitive enteropathy - diet; Celiac sprue - diet)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002443.htm
Answer: Celiac disease is an immune disorder passed down through families.  Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, or sometimes oats. It may also be found in some medicines. When a person with celiac disease eats or drinks anything containing gluten, the immune system responds by damaging the lining of the intestinal tract. This affects the body's ability to absorb nutrients.  Carefully following a gluten-free diet helps prevent symptoms of the disease.)

Answer: Celiac disease is a condition that creates inflammation in the small intestine, and damage in the lining. This prevents important components of food from being absorbed. The damage to the lining of the intestine comes from a reaction to eating gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, barley,and possibly oats, and in food made from these ingredients.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000233.htm
Answer: The exact cause of celiac disease is unknown. The lining of the intestines have small projections contains areas called villi. These structures help absorb nutrients. When people with celiac disease eat foods or use products that contain gluten, their immune system reacts by damaging the villi. As a result, the villi are unable absorb nutrients properly. Therefore, a person becomes malnourished, no matter how much food he or she eats.  The disease can develop at any point in life, from infancy to late adulthood.  People who have a family member with celiac disease are at greater risk for developing the disease. The disorder is most common in Caucasians and persons of European ancestry. Women are affected more often than men.  People with celiac disease are more likely to have:  - Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjogren syndrome  - Addison's disease  - Down syndrome  - Intestinal cancer  - Intestinal lymphoma  - Lactose intolerance  - Thyroid disease  - Type 1 diabetes)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000233.htm
Answer: The symptoms of celiac disease can be different from person to person. This can make diagnosis difficult. For example, one person may have constipation, a second may have diarrhea, and a third may have no problem with stools.  Gastrointestinal symptoms include:  - Abdominal pain, bloating, gas, or indigestion  - Constipation  - Decreased appetite (may also be increased or unchanged)  - Diarrhea, either constant or off and on  - Lactose intolerance (common when the person is diagnosed, usually goes away after treatment)  - Nausea and vomiting  - Stools that are foul smelling, oily, or and stick to the toilet when flushed  - Unexplained weight loss (although people can be overweight or of normal weight)    Other problems that can develop over time because the intestines do not absorb key nutrients include:   - Easy bruising  - Depression or anxiety  - Fatigue  - Growth delay in children  - Hair loss  - Itchy skin with a rash (dermatitis herpetiformis)  - Missed menstrual periods  - Mouth ulcers  - Muscle cramps and joint pain  - Nosebleeds  - Seizures  - Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet  - Unexplained short height    Children with celiac disease may have:  - Defects in the tooth enamel and changes in tooth color  - Delayed puberty  - Diarrhea, constipation, fatty or foul-smelling stools, nausea, or vomiting  - Irritable and fussy behavior  - Poor weight gain  - Slowed growth and shorter than normal height for their age)

ADAM_0000868_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Clinitest tablets poisoning (Also called: Urine sugar reagent poisoning; Anhydrous Benedict's reagent poisoning)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002611.htm
Answer: Summary : Clinitest tablets are used to test how much sugar (glucose) there is in a person's urine. Poisoning occurs from swallowing these tablets.   Clinitest tablets used to be used to check how well a person's diabetes was being controlled. These tablets are rarely used today. They are not meant to be swallowed, but could be taken by accident, since they look like pills.  This article is for information only. Do NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poisonous Ingredient : The poisonous ingredients in Clinitest tablets are:  - Copper sulfate  - Citric acid  - Sodium hydroxide  - Sodium carbonate

Where Found : The poisonous ingredients are found in Clinitest tablets.  Other products may also contain these ingredients.

Symptoms : Symptoms of poisoning from Clinitest tablets are:  - Blood in urine  - Burns and burning pain in the mouth and throat  - Collapse  - Convulsions  - Diarrhea, may be watery or bloody  - Lightheadedness  - Low blood pressure  - No urine output  - Pain during a bowel movement  - Severe abdominal pain  - Throat swelling (causes breathing trouble)  - Vomiting  - Weakness

Home Care : This type of poisoning requires medical help right away.  DO NOT make a person throw up. (They may do so on their own.)  If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.  If the chemical was swallowed, give the person water or orange juice right away. DO NOT give anything to drink if the person is vomiting or has a decreased level of alertness.

Before Calling Emergency : Have this information ready:   - Person's age, weight, and condition   - The name of the product   - When it was swallowed   - The amount swallowed

Poison Control : Your local poison centercan be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room : The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.   The person may receive:  - Additional flushing of the eyes  - Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and ventilator (breathing machine)  - Bronchoscopy. Camera placed down the throat to see burns in the airways and lungs.  - Chest x-ray to see if there is air leakage into the tissue around the heart and lungs  - Endoscopy. Camera placed down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and stomach.  - Fluids through a vein (IV)  - Medicine to treat symptoms and correct the body's electrolyte (body chemical) and acid-base balance

Outlook (Prognosis) : How well someone does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.  Extensive damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach are possible. The ultimate outcome depends on the extent of this damage. Damage continues to occur to the esophagus and stomach for several weeks after the poison was swallowed. Death is possible.  Keep all medicines in child-proof containers and out of the reach of children.)

GHR_0000163_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) celiac disease ? (Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/celiac-disease
Answer: Celiac disease is a condition in which the immune system is abnormally sensitive to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder; autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Without a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet, inflammation resulting from immune system overactivity may cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms involving many parts of the body.  Celiac disease can develop at any age after an individual starts eating foods containing gluten. The classic symptoms of the condition result from inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal tract. This inflammation damages the villi, which are small, finger-like projections that line the small intestine and provide a greatly increased surface area to absorb nutrients. In celiac disease, the villi become shortened and eventually flatten out. Intestinal damage causes diarrhea and poor absorption of nutrients, which may lead to weight loss. Abdominal pain, swelling (distention), and food intolerances are common in celiac disease. Inflammation associated with celiac disease may lead to an increased risk of developing certain gastrointestinal cancers such as cancers of the small intestine or esophagus.  Inflammation and poor nutrient absorption may lead to problems affecting many other organs and systems of the body in affected individuals. These health problems may include iron deficiency that results in a low number of red blood cells (anemia), vitamin deficiencies, low bone mineral density (osteoporosis), itchy skin rashes (dermatitis herpetiformis), defects in the enamel of the teeth, chronic fatigue, joint pain, poor growth, delayed puberty, infertility, or repeated miscarriages. Neurological problems have also been associated with celiac disease; these include migraine headaches, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Many people with celiac disease have one or more of these varied health problems but do not have gastrointestinal symptoms. This form of the condition is called nonclassic celiac disease. Researchers now believe that nonclassic celiac disease is actually more common than the classic form.  Celiac disease often goes undiagnosed because many of its signs and symptoms are nonspecific, which means they may occur in many disorders. Most people who have one or more of these nonspecific health problems do not have celiac disease. On average, a diagnosis of celiac disease is not made until 6 to 10 years after symptoms begin.  Some people have silent celiac disease, in which they have no symptoms of the disorder. However, people with silent celiac disease do have immune proteins in their blood (antibodies) that are common in celiac disease. They also have inflammatory damage to their small intestine that can be detected with a biopsy.  In a small number of cases, celiac disease does not improve with a gluten-free diet and progresses to a condition called refractory sprue. Refractory sprue is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption of nutrients, and an increased risk of developing a type of cancer of the immune cells called T-cell lymphoma.)

GHR_0000163_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to celiac disease ? (Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/celiac-disease
Answer: The risk of developing celiac disease is increased by certain variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that play a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.  The proteins produced from the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes attach (bind) to each other to form a functional protein complex called an antigen-binding DQ heterodimer. This complex, which is present on the surface of certain immune system cells, attaches to protein fragments (peptides) outside the cell. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria.  Celiac disease is associated with an inappropriate immune response to a segment of the gluten protein called gliadin. This inappropriate activation of the immune system causes inflammation that damages the body's organs and tissues and leads to the signs and symptoms of celiac disease.  Almost all people with celiac disease have specific variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes, which seem to increase the risk of an inappropriate immune response to gliadin. However, these variants are also found in 30 percent of the general population, and only 3 percent of individuals with the gene variants develop celiac disease.  It appears likely that other contributors, such as environmental factors and changes in other genes, also influence the development of this complex disorder.)

GHR_0000697_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) myasthenia gravis ? (Also called: MG)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/myasthenia-gravis
Answer: Myasthenia gravis is a disorder that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. The weakness most often starts in the muscles around the eyes, causing drooping of the eyelids (ptosis) and difficulty coordinating eye movements, which results in blurred or double vision. In a form of the disorder called ocular myasthenia, the weakness remains confined to the eye muscles. In most people with myasthenia gravis, however, additional muscles in the face and neck are affected. Affected individuals may have unusual facial expressions, difficulty holding up the head, speech impairment (dysarthria), and chewing and swallowing problems (dysphagia) that may lead to choking, gagging, or drooling.  Other muscles in the body are also affected in some people with myasthenia gravis. The muscles of the arms and legs may be involved, causing affected individuals to have changes in their gait or trouble with lifting objects, rising from a seated position, or climbing stairs. The muscle weakness tends to fluctuate over time; it typically worsens with activity and improves with rest.  Weakness of the muscles in the chest wall and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can cause breathing problems in some people with myasthenia gravis. About 10 percent of people with this disorder experience a potentially life-threatening complication in which these respiratory muscles weaken to the point that breathing is dangerously impaired, and the affected individual requires ventilation assistance. This respiratory failure, called a myasthenic crisis, may be triggered by stresses such as infections or reactions to medications.  People can develop myasthenia gravis at any age. For reasons that are unknown, it is most commonly diagnosed in women younger than age 40 and men older than age 60. It is uncommon in children, but some infants born to women with myasthenia gravis show signs and symptoms of the disorder for the first few days or weeks of life. This temporary occurrence of symptoms is called transient neonatal myasthenia gravis.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/celiacdisease.html
Answer: Celiac disease is an immune disease in which people can't eat gluten because it will damage their small intestine. If you have celiac disease and eat foods with gluten, your immune system responds by damaging the small intestine. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. It is found mainly in foods but may also be in other products like medicines, vitamins and supplements, lip balm, and even the glue on stamps and envelopes.    Celiac disease affects each person differently. Symptoms may occur in the digestive system, or in other parts of the body. One person might have diarrhea and abdominal pain, while another person may be irritable or depressed. Irritability is one of the most common symptoms in children. Some people have no symptoms.    Celiac disease is genetic. Blood tests can help your doctor diagnose the disease. Your doctor may also need to examine a small piece of tissue from your small intestine. Treatment is a diet free of gluten.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)

ADAM_0002354_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Learn about gluten-free diets
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000813.htm
Answer: Summary : On a gluten-free diet, you do not eat wheat, rye, and barley. These foods contain gluten, a type of protein. A gluten-free diet is the main treatment for celiac disease. Some people believe a gluten-free diet can also help improve other health problems, but there is little research to support this idea.

Reasons to Avoid Gluten : People follow a gluten-free diet for a number of reasons:  Celiac disease. People with this condition cannot eat gluten because it triggers an immune response that damages the lining of their stomach. This response causes inflammation in the small intestine and makes it hard for the body to absorb nutrients in food. Symptoms include bloating, constipation, and diarrhea.  Gluten sensitivity. People with gluten sensitivity do not have celiac disease. Eating gluten causes many of the same symptoms as in celiac disease, without the stomach damage.  Gluten intolerance. This describes people who have symptoms and may or may not have celiac disease. Symptoms include cramping, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea.  If you have one of these conditions, a gluten-free diet will help control your symptoms. It also helps prevent health problems in people with celiac disease.  Other health claims. Some people go gluten-free because they believe it can help control health problems such as headaches, depression, chronic fatigue, and weight gain. However, these claims are unproven.  Because you cut out a whole group of foods, a gluten-free diet can cause you to lose weight. However, there are easier diets to follow for weight loss. People with celiac disease often gain weight because their symptoms improve.

How it Works : On this diet, you need to learn which foods contain gluten and avoid them. This is not easy, because gluten is in many foods and food products.   Many foods are naturally gluten-free, including:  - Fruits and vegetables  - Meat, fish, poultry, and eggs  - Beans  - Nuts and seeds  - Dairy products    Other grains and starches are fine to eat, as long as they do not come boxed with seasonings:  - Quinoa  - Amaranth  - Buckwheat  - Cornmeal  - Millet  - Rice    You can also buy gluten-free versions of foods such as bread, flour, crackers, and cereals. These products are made with rice and other gluten-free flours. Keep in mind that they are often higher in sugar and calories and lower in fiber than the foods they replace.

Off-Limit Foods : When following this diet, you must avoid foods that contain gluten:  - Wheat  - Barley (this includes malt, malt flavoring, and malt vinegar)  - Rye  - Triticale (a grain that is a cross between wheat and rye)    You must also avoid these foods, which contain wheat:  - Bulgur  - Couscous  - Durum flour  - Farina  - Graham flour  - Kamut  - Semolina  - Spelt    Note that ""wheat-free"" does not always mean gluten-free. Many foods contain gluten or traces of wheat. Read the label and only buy ""gluten-free"" options of:  - Bread and other baked goods  - Pastas  - Cereals  - Crackers  - Beer  - Soy sauce  - Seitan  - Breading  - Battered or deep-fried foods  - Oats  - Processed foods, including frozen foods, soups, and rice mixes  - Salad dressings, sauces, marinades, and gravies  - Some candies, licorice  - Some medicines and vitamins (gluten is used to bind the pill ingredients together)

The Role of Exercise : A gluten-free diet is a way of eating, so exercise is not included as part of the plan. However, you should exercise for at least 30 minutes a day on most days for good health.

Health Benefits : People with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet to prevent damage to their intestines.  Avoiding gluten will not improve your heart health if you do not eat healthy foods. Be sure to substitute plenty of whole grains, fruit, and vegetables in place of gluten.

Possible Health Concerns : Many foods made with wheat flour are fortified with vitamins and minerals. Cutting out wheat and other grains can leave you short of nutrients like these:  - Calcium  - Fiber  - Folate  - Iron  - Niacin  - Riboflavin  - Thiamin   To get all the vitamins and minerals you need, eat a variety of healthy foods. Working with your health care provider or a dietitian can also help ensure you get proper nutrition.

Ease of Use : Because so many foods contain gluten, this can be a hard diet to follow. It can feel limiting when you shop or eat out. However, as the diet has become more popular, gluten-free foods have become available in more stores. Also, many restaurants are now offering gluten-free meals.

Where to Find More Information : The National Institutes of Health has a Celiac Awareness Campaignat celiac.nih.gov with information and resources.  You can find information on celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and gluten-free cooking from these organizations:  - Beyond Celiac - www.beyondceliac.org  - The Celiac Disease Foundation - celiac.org   There are also a number of books on gluten-free eating. Your best bet is to find one written by a dietitian.

When to Call Your Doctor : If you think you may have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, talk with your doctor. You should be tested for celiac disease, which is a serious condition.  If you have symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance, DO NOT stop eating gluten without first getting tested for celiac disease. You may have a different health condition that a gluten-free diet cannot treat. Also, following a gluten-free diet for several months or years may make it more difficult to accurately diagnose celiac disease. If you stop eating gluten before being tested, it will affect the results.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601129.html
Answer: Zolmitriptan comes as a tablet and an orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth) to take by mouth. It is usually taken at the first sign of a migraine headache. If your symptoms improve after you take zolmitriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may take a second tablet. However, if your symptoms do not improve after you take zolmitriptan, do not take a second tablet without calling your doctor. Your doctor will tell you the maximum number of tablets or orally disintegrating tablets you may take in a 24-hour period. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take zolmitriptan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  You may take your first dose of zolmitriptan in a doctor's office or other medical facility where you can be monitored for serious reactions.  If your doctor has prescribed a dose lower than 2.5 mg, you may use your fingers to break the 2.5-mg tablet on the line that divides it in half. However, you should not break or split the orally disintegrating tablet.  To take the orally disintegrating tablet, use dry hands to peel back the foil packaging. Immediately take out the tablet and place it on your tongue. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva. No water is needed to swallow disintegrating tablets. Do not open the foil packaging or remove the orally disintegrating tablet until just before you are ready to take it.  Call your doctor if your headaches do not get better or occur more frequently after taking zolmitriptan.  If you take zolmitriptan more often or for longer than the recommended period of time, your headaches may get worse or may occur more frequently. You should not take zolmitriptan or any other headache medication for more than 10 days per month. Call your doctor if you need to take zolmitriptan to treat more than three headaches in a 1-month period.  Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.)

Answer: The exact cause of celiac disease is unknown. The lining of the intestines have small projections contains areas called villi. These structures help absorb nutrients. When people with celiac disease eat foods or use products that contain gluten, their immune system reacts by damaging the villi. As a result, the villi are unable absorb nutrients properly. Therefore, a person becomes malnourished, no matter how much food he or she eats.  The disease can develop at any point in life, from infancy to late adulthood.  People who have a family member with celiac disease are at greater risk for developing the disease. The disorder is most common in Caucasians and persons of European ancestry. Women are affected more often than men.

Clinitest tablets used to be used to check how well a person's diabetes was being controlled. These tablets are rarely used today. They are not meant to be swallowed, but could be taken by accident, since they look like pills.  This article is for information only. Do NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poisonous Ingredient : The poisonous ingredients in Clinitest tablets are:  - Copper sulfate  - Citric acid  - Sodium hydroxide  - Sodium carbonate

Where Found : The poisonous ingredients are found in Clinitest tablets.  Other products may also contain these ingredients.

Symptoms : Symptoms of poisoning from Clinitest tablets are:  - Blood in urine  - Burns and burning pain in the mouth and throat  - Collapse  - Convulsions  - Diarrhea, may be watery or bloody  - Lightheadedness  - Low blood pressure  - No urine output  - Pain during a bowel movement  - Severe abdominal pain  - Throat swelling (causes breathing trouble)  - Vomiting  - Weakness

Home Care : This type of poisoning requires medical help right away.  DO NOT make a person throw up. (They may do so on their own.)  If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.  If the chemical was swallowed, give the person water or orange juice right away. DO NOT give anything to drink if the person is vomiting or has a decreased level of alertness.

Before Calling Emergency : Have this information ready:   - Person's age, weight, and condition   - The name of the product   - When it was swallowed   - The amount swallowed

Poison Control : Your local poison centercan be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room : The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.   The person may receive:  - Additional flushing of the eyes  - Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and ventilator (breathing machine)  - Bronchoscopy. Camera placed down the throat to see burns in the airways and lungs.  - Chest x-ray to see if there is air leakage into the tissue around the heart and lungs  - Endoscopy. Camera placed down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and stomach.  - Fluids through a vein (IV)  - Medicine to treat symptoms and correct the body's electrolyte (body chemical) and acid-base balance

Outlook (Prognosis) : How well someone does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.  Extensive damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach are possible. The ultimate outcome depends on the extent of this damage. Damage continues to occur to the esophagus and stomach for several weeks after the poison was swallowed. Death is possible.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003468.htm
Answer: Summary : A comprehensive metabolic panel is a group of blood tests. Theyprovide an overall picture of your body's chemical balance and metabolism. Metabolism refers to all the physical and chemical processes in the body that use energy.

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.

How to Prepare for the Test : You should not eat or drink for 8 hours before the test.

How the Test will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.

Why the Test is Performed : This test gives your health care provider information about:  - How your kidneys and liver are working  - Blood sugar, cholesterol, and calcium levels  - Sodium, potassium, and chloride levels (called electrolytes)  - Protein levels    Your provider may order this test during a yearly exam or routine checkup.

Normal Results : - Albumin: 3.4 to 5.4 g/dL  - Alkaline phosphatase: 44 to 147 IU/L  - ALT (alanine aminotransferase): 10 to 40 IU/L  - AST (aspartate aminotransferase): 10 to 34 IU/L  - BUN (blood urea nitrogen): 6 to 20 mg/dL  - Calcium: 8.5 to 10.2 mg/dL  - Chloride: 96 - 106 mEq/L  - CO2 (carbon dioxide): 23 to 29 mEq/L  - Creatinine: 0.6 to 1.3 mg/dL  - Glucose : 70 to 100 mg/dL  - Potassium : 3.7 to 5.2 mEq/L  - Sodium: 135 to 145 mEq/L  - Total bilirubin: 0.3 to 1.9 mg/dL  - Total protein: 6.0 to 8.3 g/dL   Normal values for glucose and creatinine can vary with age.   Normal value ranges for all tests may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results can be due to a variety of different medical conditions. These may include kidney failure, breathing problems, and diabetes complications.

Risks : There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.  Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling lightheaded  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken))

Reasons to Avoid Gluten : People follow a gluten-free diet for a number of reasons:  Celiac disease. People with this condition cannot eat gluten because it triggers an immune response that damages the lining of their stomach. This response causes inflammation in the small intestine and makes it hard for the body to absorb nutrients in food. Symptoms include bloating, constipation, and diarrhea.  Gluten sensitivity. People with gluten sensitivity do not have celiac disease. Eating gluten causes many of the same symptoms as in celiac disease, without the stomach damage.  Gluten intolerance. This describes people who have symptoms and may or may not have celiac disease. Symptoms include cramping, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea.  If you have one of these conditions, a gluten-free diet will help control your symptoms. It also helps prevent health problems in people with celiac disease.  Other health claims. Some people go gluten-free because they believe it can help control health problems such as headaches, depression, chronic fatigue, and weight gain. However, these claims are unproven.  Because you cut out a whole group of foods, a gluten-free diet can cause you to lose weight. However, there are easier diets to follow for weight loss. People with celiac disease often gain weight because their symptoms improve.

How it Works : On this diet, you need to learn which foods contain gluten and avoid them. This is not easy, because gluten is in many foods and food products.   Many foods are naturally gluten-free, including:  - Fruits and vegetables  - Meat, fish, poultry, and eggs  - Beans  - Nuts and seeds  - Dairy products    Other grains and starches are fine to eat, as long as they do not come boxed with seasonings:  - Quinoa  - Amaranth  - Buckwheat  - Cornmeal  - Millet  - Rice    You can also buy gluten-free versions of foods such as bread, flour, crackers, and cereals. These products are made with rice and other gluten-free flours. Keep in mind that they are often higher in sugar and calories and lower in fiber than the foods they replace.

Off-Limit Foods : When following this diet, you must avoid foods that contain gluten:  - Wheat  - Barley (this includes malt, malt flavoring, and malt vinegar)  - Rye  - Triticale (a grain that is a cross between wheat and rye)    You must also avoid these foods, which contain wheat:  - Bulgur  - Couscous  - Durum flour  - Farina  - Graham flour  - Kamut  - Semolina  - Spelt    Note that ""wheat-free"" does not always mean gluten-free. Many foods contain gluten or traces of wheat. Read the label and only buy ""gluten-free"" options of:  - Bread and other baked goods  - Pastas  - Cereals  - Crackers  - Beer  - Soy sauce  - Seitan  - Breading  - Battered or deep-fried foods  - Oats  - Processed foods, including frozen foods, soups, and rice mixes  - Salad dressings, sauces, marinades, and gravies  - Some candies, licorice  - Some medicines and vitamins (gluten is used to bind the pill ingredients together)

The Role of Exercise : A gluten-free diet is a way of eating, so exercise is not included as part of the plan. However, you should exercise for at least 30 minutes a day on most days for good health.

Health Benefits : People with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet to prevent damage to their intestines.  Avoiding gluten will not improve your heart health if you do not eat healthy foods. Be sure to substitute plenty of whole grains, fruit, and vegetables in place of gluten.

Possible Health Concerns : Many foods made with wheat flour are fortified with vitamins and minerals. Cutting out wheat and other grains can leave you short of nutrients like these:  - Calcium  - Fiber  - Folate  - Iron  - Niacin  - Riboflavin  - Thiamin   To get all the vitamins and minerals you need, eat a variety of healthy foods. Working with your health care provider or a dietitian can also help ensure you get proper nutrition.

Ease of Use : Because so many foods contain gluten, this can be a hard diet to follow. It can feel limiting when you shop or eat out. However, as the diet has become more popular, gluten-free foods have become available in more stores. Also, many restaurants are now offering gluten-free meals.

Where to Find More Information : The National Institutes of Health has a Celiac Awareness Campaignat celiac.nih.gov with information and resources.  You can find information on celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and gluten-free cooking from these organizations:  - Beyond Celiac - www.beyondceliac.org  - The Celiac Disease Foundation - celiac.org   There are also a number of books on gluten-free eating. Your best bet is to find one written by a dietitian.

When to Call Your Doctor : If you think you may have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, talk with your doctor. You should be tested for celiac disease, which is a serious condition.  If you have symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance, DO NOT stop eating gluten without first getting tested for celiac disease. You may have a different health condition that a gluten-free diet cannot treat. Also, following a gluten-free diet for several months or years may make it more difficult to accurately diagnose celiac disease. If you stop eating gluten before being tested, it will affect the results.)

ADAM_0002446_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Low-salt diet (Also called: Low-sodium diet; Salt restriction)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000109.htm
Answer: Summary : Your body needs salt to work properly. Salt contains sodium. Sodium helps your body control many functions. Too much sodium in your diet can be bad for you. For most people, dietary sodium comes from salt that is in or added to their food.   If you have high blood pressure or heart failure, youwill likely be askedto limit how much salt you eat every day. Even people with normal blood pressure will have lower (and healthier) blood pressure if they lower how much salt they eat.   Dietary sodium is measured in milligrams (mg). Your doctor may tell you to eat no more than 2,300 mg a day when you have these conditions. For some people, 1,500 mg a day is an even better goal.

Limiting Salt in Your Diet : Eating a variety of foods every day can help you limit salt. Try to eat a balanced diet.  Buy fresh vegetables and fruits whenever possible. They are naturally low in salt. Canned foods often contain salt to preserve the color of the food and keep it looking fresh. For this reason, it is better to buy fresh foods. Also buy:  - Fresh meats, chicken or turkey, and fish  - Fresh or frozen vegetables and fruits    Look for these words on labels:   - Low-sodium   - sodium-free  - No salt added  - Sodium-reduced  - Unsalted    Check all labels for how much salt foods contain per serving.  Ingredients are listed in order of the amount the food contains. Avoid foods that list salt near the top of the list of ingredients. A product with less than 100 mg of salt per serving is good.  Stay away from foods that are always high in salt. Some common ones are:  - Processed foods, such as cured or smoked meats, bacon, hot dogs, sausage, bologna, ham, and salami  - Anchovies, olives, pickles, and sauerkraut  - Soy and Worcestershire sauces, tomato and other vegetable juices, and most cheeses  - Many bottled salad dressings and salad dressing mixes  - Most snack foods, such as chips, crackers, and others    When you cook, replace salt with other seasonings. Pepper, garlic, herbs, and lemon are good choices. Avoid packaged spice blends. They often contain salt.  Use garlic and onion powder, not garlic and onion salt. Do not eat foods with monosodium glutamate (MSG).  When you go out to eat, stick to steamed, grilled, baked, boiled, and broiled foods with no added salt, sauce, or cheese. If you think the restaurant might use MSG, ask them not to add it to your order.  Use oil and vinegar on salads. Add fresh or dried herbs. Eat fresh fruit or sorbet for dessert, when you have dessert. Take the salt shaker off your table. Replace it with a salt-free seasoning mix.  Ask your doctor or pharmacist what antacids and laxatives contain little or no salt, if you need these medicines. Some have a lot of salt in them.  Home water softeners add salt to water. If you have one, limit how much tap water you drink. Drink bottled water instead.  Ask your doctor if a salt substitute is safe for you. Many contain a lot of potassium. This may be harmful if you have certain medical conditions or if you are taking certain medicines. However, if extra potassium in your diet would not be harmful to you, a salt substitute is a good way to lower the amount of sodium in your diet.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000724.htm
Answer: Summary : Snacks are small, quick mini-meals. They include fruits, vegetables, nuts, and crackers. Snacks are eaten between meals and help keep you full. Healthy snacks are:  - Whole grain  - Low-calorie  - Low-salt  - Low-sugar  - Fresh foods, rather than processed

Snacks list : Most healthy snacks with 100 calories or less fit in the palm of your hand. Here are 20 options to choose from.  - 1 medium apple  - 1 medium banana  - 1 cup of blueberries  - 1 cup of grapes  -  cup of raisins  - 1 small banana  - 1 cup of steamed green beans  - 1 cup of carrots, broccoli, or bell peppers with 2 tbsp. hummus  - 1 cup of cherry tomatoes  -  cup of cooked oats  - 3 cups of air-popped popcorn  -  of a whole wheat English muffin with jelly  - 2 brown rice or multigrain rice cakes  - 8 baked tortilla chips with salsa  - 6 oz. plain, fat-free yogurt  -  cup of low-fat cottage cheese  - 1 oz. of low-fat cheddar cheese  - 1 cup of low-sodium chicken noodle or vegetable soup  - 1 hard-boiled egg  - 10 almonds

Why snacks can be good for you : Snacks are good for you, as long as you choose healthy snacks and dont eat too much. Small snacks between meals can keep you from overeating at mealtimes and help you manage your weight.  Healthy snacks for adults can provide energy for work and exercise. Healthy snacks and drinks for children provide much needed energy for growth, school, and sports. Offer young children healthy snacks, and they may be more likely to choose them on their own when they get older. Healthy snacks also help you maintain healthy teeth.  Eating a variety of snacks like the ones above will give you extra vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants (substances that help prevent cell damage), and other disease-fighting nutrients. Choosing low-calorie snacks can help you or your child maintain a healthy weight.  Avoid high-calorie sports drinks and packaged, processed snacks, likes chips or cookies.  If you have diabetes, you may need to pay attention to the number of carbohydrates in your snacks, as well.)

GHR_0000879_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) ring chromosome 20 syndrome ? (Also called: r(20) syndrome; ring 20 syndrome; ring chromosome 20; ring chromosome 20 epilepsy syndrome)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ring-chromosome-20-syndrome
Answer: Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is a condition that affects the normal development and function of the brain. The most common feature of this condition is recurrent seizures (epilepsy) in childhood. The seizures may occur during the day or at night during sleep. They are described as partial seizures because they affect only one area of the brain, a region called the frontal lobe. In many cases, the seizures are complex and resistant to treatment with anti-epileptic drugs. Prolonged seizure episodes known as non-convulsive status epilepticus also appear to be characteristic of ring chromosome 20 syndrome. These episodes involve confusion and behavioral changes.  Most people with ring chromosome 20 syndrome also have some degree of intellectual disability and behavioral difficulties. Although these problems can appear either before or after the onset of epilepsy, they tend to worsen after seizures develop. Additional features of this condition can include slow growth and short stature, a small head (microcephaly), and subtle differences in facial features. Major birth defects are rarely seen with ring chromosome 20 syndrome.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ring-chromosome-20-syndrome
Answer: Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is caused by a chromosomal abnormality known as a ring chromosome 20 or r(20). A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and its broken ends fuse together. People with ring chromosome 20 syndrome have one copy of this abnormal chromosome in some or all of their cells.  It is not well understood how the ring chromosome causes the signs and symptoms of this syndrome. In some affected individuals, genes near the ends of chromosome 20 are deleted when the ring chromosome forms. Researchers suspect that the loss of these genes may be responsible for epilepsy and other health problems. However, other affected individuals do not have gene deletions associated with the ring chromosome. In these people, the ring chromosome may change the activity of certain genes on chromosome 20, or it may be unable to copy (replicate) itself normally during cell division. Researchers are still working to determine the precise relationship between the ring chromosome 20 and the characteristic features of the syndrome.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ring-chromosome-20-syndrome
Answer: Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is almost never inherited. A ring chromosome typically occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. Often, the ring chromosome is present in only some of a person's cells. This situation is known as mosaicism.  Most affected individuals have no history of the disorder in their families. However, at least one family has been reported in which a ring chromosome 20 was passed from a mother to her children.)

Answer: Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. It is found mainly in foods but may also be in other products like medicines, vitamins, and supplements. People with gluten sensitivity have problems with gluten. It is different from celiac disease, an immune disease in which people can't eat gluten because it will damage their small intestine.    Some of the symptoms of gluten sensitivity are similar to celiac disease. They include tiredness and stomachaches. It can cause other symptoms too, including muscle cramps and leg numbness. But it does not damage the small intestine like celiac disease.    Researchers are still learning more about gluten sensitivity. If your health care provider thinks you have it, he or she may suggest that you stop eating gluten to see if your symptoms go away. However, you should first be tested to rule out celiac disease.

MPlusHealthTopics_0000831_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Sodium (Also called: Salt)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/sodium.html
Answer: Summary : Table salt is made up of the elements sodium and chlorine - the technical name for salt is sodium chloride. Your body needs some sodium to work properly. It helps with the function of nerves and muscles. It also helps to keep the right balance of fluids in your body. Your kidneys control how much sodium is in your body. If you have too much and your kidneys can't get rid it, sodium builds up in your blood. This can lead to high blood pressure. High blood pressure can lead to other health problems.    Most people in the U.S. get more sodium in their diets than they need. A key to healthy eating is choosing foods low in salt and sodium. Doctors recommend you eat less than 2.4 grams per day. That equals about 1 teaspoon of table salt a day. Reading food labels can help you see how much sodium is in prepared foods.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute)

MPlusHerbsSuppls_0000076_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is Phosphate salts ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/735.html
Answer: Phosphate salts refers to many different combinations of the chemical phosphate with salts and minerals. Foods high in phosphate include dairy products, whole grain cereals, nuts, and certain meats. Phosphates found in dairy products and meats seem to be more easily absorbed by the body than phosphates found in cereal grains. Cola drinks contain a lot of phosphate - so much, in fact, that they can cause too much phosphate in the blood.     People use phosphate salts for medicine. Be careful not to confuse phosphate salts with substances such as organophosphates, or with tribasic sodium phosphates and tribasic potassium phosphates, which are very poisonous.     Phosphate salts are taken by mouth for treating blood phosphate levels that are too low and blood calcium levels that are too high, and for preventing kidney stones. They are also taken for treating osteomalacia (often called rickets in children), a condition caused by a mineral imbalance in the body that leads to softening of the bones. Phosphate salts are also used for improving exercise performance, as an antacid for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and as a laxative for emptying the bowels before surgery.     Phosphate salts and calcium are applied to sensitive teeth to reduce pain.     Rectally, phosphate salts are used as a laxative to clean the bowels before surgery or intestinal tests.     Healthcare providers sometimes give potassium phosphate intravenously (by IV) for treating low phosphate and high calcium levels in the blood, and for preventing low phosphate in patients who are being tube-fed.)

MPlusHerbsSuppls_0000076_Sec2.txt,"Question: How effective is Phosphate salts ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/735.html
Answer: Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.  The effectiveness ratings for PHOSPHATE SALTS are as follows: Effective for...  - Preparing the bowel for a medical procedure. Sodium phosphate tablets (OsmoPrep, Visicol, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Raleigh, NC) are FDA-approved for cleansing the colon before a colonoscopy. Over-the-counter sodium phosphate solutions and enemas may also be used for bowel cleansing before medical procedures.   - Low phosphate levels in the blood. Taking sodium or potassium phosphate by mouth is effective for preventing or treating low phosphate levels in the blood. Intravenous phosphate salts may also treat low phosphate levels in the blood when used under the supervision of a physician.  Likely effective for...  - Constipation. Sodium phosphate is an FDA-permitted over-the-counter (OTC) ingredient for the treatment of constipation. These products are taken by mouth or used as enemas.   - Indigestion. Aluminum phosphate and calcium phosphate are FDA-permitted ingredients used in antacids.   - High calcium levels in the blood. Taking phosphate salt (except calcium phosphate) by mouth is likely effective for treating high levels of calcium in the blood. But intravenous phosphate salts should not be used.   Possibly effective for...  - Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Taking potassium phosphate by mouth might help prevent calcium kidney stones from forming in patients with high urine levels of calcium.  Possibly ineffective for...  - Athletic performance. Some early research suggests that taking sodium phosphate by mouth four times daily for 6 days might increase athletic performance in male cyclists. However, most evidence shows that taking phosphate salts by mouth does not improve exercise performance.  Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...  - Diabetes complication (diabetic ketoacidosis). Early research suggests that taking potassium phosphate intravenously (by IV) does not improve a diabetes complication in which the body produces too many blood acids called ketones. People with this condition should only be given phosphates if they have low phosphate levels.   - Complications that occur upon eating in people who were previously starving (refeeding syndrome). Limited research shows that giving sodium and potassium phosphates intravenously (by IV) over 24 hours prevents refeeding syndrome when restarting nutrition in people who are severely malnourished or starved.    - Sensitive teeth.   - Other conditions.  More evidence is needed to rate phosphate salts for these uses.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a616004.html
Answer: Amphetamine comes as an tablet (Evekeo) and as an extended-release (long-acting) suspension (Dyanavel XR) to take by mouth. The suspension is usually taken once daily in the morning with or without food. For treatment of ADHD or narcolepsy, the tablet is usually taken with or without food one to three times daily, 4 to 6 hours apart, with the first dose in the morning. For weight loss, the tablet is usually taken 30 to 60 minutes before meals. Amphetamine should not be taken in the late afternoon or evening because it may cause difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take amphetamine exactly as directed.  Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly.  It is important to use an oral syringe (measuring device) to accurately measure and take your dose of the suspension. Ask your pharmacist for a device if it was not provided. Wash the oral syringe thoroughly after each use.  If you or your child are taking amphetamine for ADHD, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of amphetamine and increase your dose gradually, every 4 to 7 days, depending on the medication. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking amphetamine from time to time to see if the medication is still needed. Follow these directions carefully.  If you are taking amphetamine for narcolepsy, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of amphetamine and increase your dose gradually, not more often than once every week. Follow these directions carefully.)

ADAM_0000424_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Benign positional vertigo ? (Also called: Vertigo - positional; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; BPPV: dizziness- positional)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001420.htm
Answer: Benign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It is caused by a problem in the inner ear.   The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. When you move, the fluid moves inside these tubes. The canals are very sensitive to any movement of the fluid. The sensation of the fluid moving in the tube tells your brain the position of your body. This helps you keep your balance.  BPPV occurs when a small piece of bone-like calcium breaks free and floats inside the tube. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position.  BPPV has no major risk factors. But, your risk for developing BPPV may increase if you have:  - Family members with BPPV  - Had a prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head)  - Had an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis)

Answer: Your health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your medical history.  To diagnose BPPV, your provider may perform a test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver.  - Your provider holds your head in a certain position. Then you are asked to lie quickly backward over a table.  - As you do this, your provider will look for abnormal eye movements and ask if you feel like you are spinning.    If this test doesn't show a clear result, you may be asked to do other tests.   You may have brain and nervous system (neurological) tests to rule out other causes. These may include:  - Electroencephalogram (EEG)  - Electronystagmography (ENG)  - Head CT  - Head MRI  - Hearing test  - Magnetic resonance angiography of the head  - Warming and cooling the inner ear with water or air to test eye movements.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001420.htm
Answer: Your provider will teach you how to do a procedure called Epley's maneuver. It can move the small piece of calcium that is floating inside your inner ear. This treatment works best to cure BPPV. Other exercises, such as balance therapy, may help some people.  Some medicines can help relieve spinning sensations:  - Antihistamines  - Anticholinergics  - Sedative-hypnotics   But, these medicines often do not work well for treating vertigo.  Follow instructions on how to take care for yourself at home. To keep your symptoms from getting worse, avoid the positions that trigger it.)

ADAM_0003161_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Positioning your baby for breastfeeding (Also called: Breastfeeding positions; Bonding with your baby)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000634.htm
Answer: Summary : Be patient with yourself as you learn to breastfeed. Know that breastfeeding takes practice. Give yourself 2 to 3 weeks to get the hang of it.   Learn how to position your baby to breastfeed. Know how to hold your baby in different positions so your nipples do not get sore and so you empty your breasts of milk.

Breastfeeding Positions : You will be more comfortable nursing if you know how to position your baby on your breast. Find a position that works well for you and your baby. Learn about breastfeeding:  - Attend a breastfeeding class.  - Watch someone else breastfeed.  - Practice with an experienced nursing mother.  - Talk with a lactation consultant. A lactation consultant is an expert in breastfeeding. This person can teach you and your baby how to breastfeed. The consultant can help with positions and offer advice when your baby has trouble sucking.

Types of Breastfeeding Positions : CRADLE HOLD  This hold works best for full-term babies. Some new mothers have trouble guiding the baby's mouth to their breast in this hold. If you have had a cesarean birth (C-section), your baby may put too much pressure on your stomach in this hold.  Here's how to do the cradle hold:  - Sit in a comfortable chair with arm rests or a bed with pillows.  - Hold your baby on your lap, lying on the side so that the face, stomach, and knees are facing you.  - Tuck your baby's lower arm under your arm.  - If you are nursing on the right breast, hold your baby's head in the crook of your right arm. Use your arm and hand to support the neck, back, and bottom.  - Keep your baby's knees snug against your body.  - If your nipple hurts, see if your baby has slipped down and the knees are facing the ceiling instead of being tucked in next to your side. Adjust your baby's position if you need to.    FOOTBALL HOLD  Use the football hold if you had a C-section. This hold is good for babies that have trouble latching on because you can guide their head. Women with large breasts or flat nipples also like the football hold.  - Hold your baby like a football. Tuck the baby under the arm on the same side where you will nurse.  - Hold your baby at your side, under your arm.  - Cradle the back of your baby's head in your hand so the baby's nose is pointing at your nipple. The baby's feet and legs will be pointing back. Use your other hand to support your breast. Gently guide your baby to your nipple.    SIDE LYING POSITION  Use this position if you had a C-section or a hard delivery that makes it hard for you to sit up. You can use this position when you are lying in bed.  - Lie on your side.  - Lie your baby close to you with the baby's face at your breast. Pull your baby in snugly and place a pillow behind your baby's back to prevent backwards rolling.

Take Care of Your Nipples : Your nipples naturally make a lubricant to prevent drying, cracking, or infections. In order to keep your nipples healthy:  - Avoid soaps and harsh washing or drying of your breasts and nipples. This can cause dryness and cracking.  - Rub a little breast milk on your nipple after feeding to protect it. Keep your nipples dry to prevent cracking and infection.  - If you have cracked nipples, apply 100% pure lanolin after feedings.   - Try glycerin nipple pads that can be chilled and placed over your nipples to help soothe and heal cracked or painful nipples.

Alternate Names : Breastfeeding positions; Bonding with your baby)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000861.htm
Answer: Syphilis is a sexually transmitted, infectious disease caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum. This bacterium causes infection when it gets into broken skin or mucus membranes, usually of the genitals. Syphilis is most often transmitted through sexual contact, although it also can be transmitted in other ways.  Syphilis occurs worldwide, most commonly in urban areas. The number of cases is rising fastest in men who have sex with men. Young adults ages 15 to 25 are the highest-risk population. People have no natural resistance to syphilis.  Because people may be unaware that they are infected with syphilis, many states require tests for syphilis before marriage. All pregnant women who receive prenatal care should be screened for syphilis to prevent the infection from passing to their newborn (congenital syphilis).  Syphilis has three stages:  - Primary syphilis  - Secondary syphilis  - Tertiary syphilis (the late phase of the illness)    Secondary syphilis, tertiary syphilis, and congenital syphilis are not seen as often in the United States as they were in the past because of the availability of:  - Free, government-sponsored sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics  - Screening tests for syphilis  - Public education about STIs  - Prenatal screening)

Answer: Symptoms of primary syphilis are:  - Small, painless open sore or ulcer (called a chancre) on the genitals, mouth, skin, or rectum that heals by itself in 3to 6 weeks  - Enlarged lymph nodes in the area of the sore    The bacteria continue to grow in the body, but there are few symptoms until the second stage.  Secondary syphilis symptoms may include:  - Skin rash, usually on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet  - Sores called mucous patches in or around the mouth, vagina, or penis  - Moist, warty patches (called condylomata lata) in the genitals or skin folds  - Fever  - General ill feeling  - Loss of appetite  - Muscle aches  - Joint pain  - Swollen lymph nodes  - Vision changes  - Hair loss    Symptoms of tertiary syphilis depend on which organs have been affected. They vary widely and can be difficult to diagnose. Symptoms include:  - Damage to the heart, causing aneurysms or valve disease  - Central nervous system disorders (neurosyphilis)  - Tumors of skin, bones, or liver)

MPlusHealthTopics_0000866_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Syphilis ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/syphilis.html
Answer: Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by bacteria. It infects the genital area, lips, mouth, or anus of both men and women. You usually get syphilis from sexual contact with someone who has it. It can also pass from mother to baby during pregnancy.    The early stage of syphilis usually causes a single, small, painless sore. Sometimes it causes swelling in nearby lymph nodes. If you do not treat it, syphilis usually causes a non-itchy skin rash, often on your hands and feet. Many people do not notice symptoms for years. Symptoms can go away and come back.    The sores caused by syphilis make it easier to get or give someone HIV during sex. If you are pregnant, syphilis can cause birth defects, or you could lose your baby. In rare cases, syphilis causes serious health problems and even death.    Syphilis is easy to cure with antibiotics if you catch it early. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading syphilis.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000861.htm
Answer: Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, such as:   - Doxycycline  - Penicillin G benzathine  - Tetracycline (for patients who are allergic to penicillin)    Length of treatment depends on how severe the syphilis is, and factors such as the patient's overall health.  To treat syphilis during pregnancy, penicillin is the drug of choice. Tetracycline cannot be used for treatment because it is dangerous to the unborn baby. Erythromycin may not prevent congenital syphilis in the baby. People who are allergic to penicillin should ideally be desensitized to it, and then treated with penicillin.  Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection.  Symptoms and signs of this reaction include:  - Chills  - Fever  - General ill feeling (malaise)  - Headache  - Joint aches  - Muscle aches  - Nausea  - Rash    These symptoms usually disappear within 24 hours.  Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection.  All sexual partners of the person with syphilis should also be treated. Syphilis is extremely contagious in the primary and secondary stages.)

ADAM_0001054_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about CSF glucose test (Also called: Glucose test - CSF; Cerebrospinal fluid glucose test)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003633.htm
Answer: Summary : A CSF glucose test measures the amount of sugar (glucose) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear fluid that flows in the space surrounding the spinal cord and brain.

How the Test is Performed : A sample of CSF is needed. A lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap, is the most common way to collect this sample. For information on this procedure, see the article on lumbar puncture.  Other methods for collecting CSF are rarely used, but may be recommended in some cases. They include:  - Cisternal puncture  - Ventricular puncture  - Removal of CSF from a tube that is already in the CSF, such as a shunt or ventricular drain    The sample is sent to a laboratory for testing.

Why the Test is Performed : This test may be done to diagnose:  - Tumors  - Infections  - Inflammation of the central nervous system  - Delirium  - Other neurological and medical conditions

Normal Results : The glucose level in the CSF should be 50 to 80 mg/100 mL (or greater than 2/3 of the blood sugar level).  Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.  The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results include higher and lower glucose levels. Abnormal results may be due to:  - Infection (bacterial or fungus)  - Inflammation of the central nervous system  - Tumor)

ADAM_0001745_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Glucagon blood test
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003716.htm
Answer: Summary : A glucagon blood test measures the amount of a hormone called glucagon in your blood. Glucagon is produced by cells in the pancreas. It helps control your blood sugar level by increasing blood sugar when it is too low.

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.

How to Prepare for the Test : Your health care provider will tell you if you need to fast (not eat anything) for a period of time before the test.

How the Test will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.

Why the Test is Performed : Glucagon stimulates the liver to release glucose. As the level of blood sugar decreases, the pancreas releases more glucagon. And as blood sugar increases, the pancreas releases less glucagon.   The provider may measure glucagon level if a person has symptoms of:  - Diabetes  - Glucagonoma (rare tumor of the pancreas) with symptoms of a skin rash called necrotizing migratory erythema, weight loss, mild diabetes, anemia, stomatitis, glossitis  - Growth hormone deficiency in children  - Liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver and poor liver function)  - Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)  - Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (disease in which one or more of the endocrine glands are overactive or form a tumor)  - Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)

Normal Results : The normal range is 50 to 100 pg/mL.  Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may indicate that the person may have a condition described above under Why the Test Is Performed.   Glucagon can be increased by prolonged fasting.

Risks : Veins vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.  Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling light-headed  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken))

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003581.htm
Answer: Summary : The glucose urine test measures the amount of sugar (glucose) in a urine sample. The presence of glucose in the urine is called glycosuria or glucosuria.  Glucose level can also be measured using a blood test or a cerebrospinal fluid test.

How the Test is Performed : After you provide a urine sample, it is tested right away. The health care provider uses a dipstick made with a color-sensitive pad. The color the dipstick changes to tells the provider the level of glucose in your urine.   If needed,your provider may ask you to collect your urine at home over 24 hours. Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.

How to Prepare for the Test : Certain medicinescan change the result of this test. Before the test, tell your provider which medicines you are taking. Do not stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.

How the Test will Feel : The test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.

Why the Test is Performed : This test was commonly used to test for and monitor diabetes in the past. Now, blood tests to measure glucose level in the blood are easy to do and are used instead of the glucose urine test.  The glucose urine test may be ordered when the doctor suspects renal glycosuria. This is a rare condition in which glucose is released from the kidneys into the urine, even when the blood glucose level is normal.

Normal Results : Glucose is not usually found in urine. If it is, further testing is needed.  Normal glucose range in urine: 0to 0.8 mmol/l (0to 15 mg/dL)  The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to yourhealth care providerabout the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Higher than normal levels of glucose may occur with:  - Diabetes: Small increases in urine glucose levels after a large meal are not always a cause for concern.    - Pregnancy: Up to half of women have glucose in their urine at sometime during pregnancy. Glucose in the urine may mean that a woman has gestational diabetes.  - Renal glycosuria: A rare condition in which glucose is released from the kidneys into the urine, even when blood glucose levelsare normal.

Risks : There are no risks with this test.)

Answer: Your body gets energy from the glucose in your blood. A hormone called insulin helps the cells in your body use glucose. If you have prediabetes, this process does not work as well. Glucose builds up in your bloodstream. If the levels get high enough, you can develop type 2 diabetes.  Having diabetes increases the risk for certain health problems. This is because high glucose levels in the blood can damage the blood vessels and nerves. This can lead to heart disease and stroke. If you have prediabetes, damage may already be occurring in your blood vessels.   Having prediabetes is a wake-up call to take action to improve your health.)

Answer: Your health care provider will talk with you about your condition and your risks from prediabetes. To help you prevent diabetes, your provider will likely suggest certain lifestyle changes:  Eat healthy foods: This includes whole grains, lean proteins, low-fat dairy, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Watch portion sizes, and avoid sweets and fried foods.   Lose weight: Just a small weight loss can make a big difference in your health. For example, your provider may suggest that you lose about 7% of your body weight. So, if you weigh 200 pounds, your goal would be to lose about 14 pounds. Your provider may suggest a diet or you can join a program to help you lose weight.  Get more exercise: Aim to get at least 30 to 60 minutes of moderate exercise at least 5 days a week. This can include brisk walking, riding your bike, or swimming. You can also break up exercise into smaller sessions throughout the day.  Take medicines as directed: Depending on your other risk factors, your provider may prescribe medicines to lower cholesterol or blood pressure or to help prevent diabetes.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency
Answer: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is a genetic disorder that occurs most often in males. This condition mainly affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. In affected individuals, a defect in an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase causes red blood cells to break down prematurely. This destruction of red blood cells is called hemolysis.  The most common medical problem associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is hemolytic anemia, which occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. This type of anemia leads to paleness, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark urine, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. In people with glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiency, hemolytic anemia is most often triggered by bacterial or viral infections or by certain drugs (such as some antibiotics and medications used to treat malaria). Hemolytic anemia can also occur after eating fava beans or inhaling pollen from fava plants (a reaction called favism).  Glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiency is also a significant cause of mild to severe jaundice in newborns. Many people with this disorder, however, never experience any signs or symptoms.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/bloodsugar.html
Answer: Summary : Blood sugar, or glucose, is the main sugar found in your blood. It comes from the food you eat, and is your body's main source of energy. Your blood carries glucose to all of your body's cells to use for energy.    Diabetes is a disease in which your blood sugar levels are too high. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. Even if you don't have diabetes, sometimes you may have problems with blood sugar that is too low or too high. Keeping a regular schedule of eating, activity, and taking any medicines you need can help.    If you do have diabetes, it is very important to keep your blood sugar numbers in your target range. You may need to check your blood sugar several times each day. Your health care provider will also do a blood test called an A1C. It checks your average blood sugar level over the past three months. If your blood sugar is too high, you may need to take medicines and/or follow a special diet.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682480.html
Answer: Glucagon is usually given by injection beneath the skin, in the muscle, or in the vein. It comes as a powder and liquid that will need to be mixed just before administering the dose. Instructions for mixing and giving the injection are in the package. Glucagon should be administered as soon as possible after discovering that the patient is unconscious from low blood sugar. After the injection, the patient should be turned onto the side to prevent choking if they vomit. Once the glucagon has been given, contact your doctor. It is very important that all patients have a household member who knows the symptoms of low blood sugar and how to administer glucagon.  If you have low blood sugar often, keep a glucagon kit with you at all times. You should be able to recognize some of the signs and symptoms of low blood sugar (i.e., shakiness, dizziness or lightheadedness, sweating, confusion, nervousness or irritability, sudden changes in behavior or mood, headache, numbness or tingling around the mouth, weakness, pale skin, sudden hunger, clumsy or jerky movements). Try to eat or drink a food or beverage with sugar in it, such as hard candy or fruit juice, before it is necessary to administer glucagon.  Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your pharmacist or doctor to explain any part you or your household members do not understand. Use glucagon exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.)

ADAM_0000924_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Communicating with patients
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000456.htm
Answer: Summary : Patient education allows patients to play a bigger role in their own care. It also aligns with the growing movement toward patient- and family-centered care.  To be effective, patient education needs to be more than instructions and information. Teachers and health care providers need to be able to assess patient needs and communicate clearly.  The success of patient education depends largely on how well you assess your patient's:  - Needs  - Concerns  - Readiness to learn  - Preferences  - Support  - Barriers and limitations (such as physical and mental capacity, and low health literacy)    Often, the first step is to find out what the patient already knows. Use these guidelines to do a thorough assessment before starting patient education:  - Gather clues. Talk to the health care team members and observe the patient. Be careful not to make assumptions. Patient teaching based on incorrect assumptions may not be very effective and may take more time.  - Get to know your patient. Introduce yourself and explain your role in your patient's care. Review their medical record and ask basic get-to-know-you questions.  - Establish a rapport. Make eye contact when appropriate and help your patient feel comfortable with you. Pay attention to the person's concerns.  - Gain trust. Show respect and treat each person with compassion and without judgment.  - Determine your patient's readiness to learn. Ask your patients about their outlooks, attitudes, and motivations.  - Learn the patient's perspective. Talk to the patient about worries, fears, and possible misconceptions. The information you receive can help guide your patient teaching.  - Ask the right questions. Ask if the patient has concerns, not just questions. Use open-ended questions that require the patient to reveal more details. Listen carefully. The patient's answers will help you learn the person's core beliefs. This will help you understand the patient's motivation and let you plan the best ways to teach.  - Learn about the patient's skills. Find out what your patient already knows. You may want to use the teach-back method (also called the show-me method or closing the loop) to figure out what the patient may have learned from other health care providers. The teach-back method is a way to confirm that you have explained the information in a way that the patient they understands. Also, find out what skills the patient may still need to develop.  - Involve others. Ask if the patient wants other people involved with the care process. It is possible that the person who volunteers to be involved in your patient's care may not be the person your patient prefers to be involved. Learn about the support available to your patient.  - Identify barriers and limitations. You may perceive barriers to education, and the patient may confirm them. Some factors, such as low health literacy may be more subtle and harder to recognize.  - Take time to establish rapport. Do a comprehensive assessment. It is worth it, because your patient education efforts will be more effective.)

ADAM_0001110_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Deciding to have knee or hip replacement
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000368.htm
Answer: Summary : There are many ways to help decide to have knee or hip replacement surgery or not. These may include reading about the operation and talking to others with knee or hip problems.  A key step is talking to your health care provider about your quality of life and goals for surgery.  Surgery may or may not be the right choice for you. Only careful thought can help you make a decision.

Who Benefits From Knee or hip Replacement Surgery? : The most common reason to have a knee or hip replaced is to provide relief from severe arthritis pain that limits your activities. Your provider may recommend replacement surgery when:  - Pain prevents you from sleeping or doing normal activities.  - You cannot move around by yourself and have to use a cane or walker.  - Your pain has not improved with other treatment.  - You understand the surgery and recovery involved.    Some people are more willing to accept the limits knee or hip pain places on them. They will wait until the problems are more severe. Others will want to have joint replacement surgery in order to continue with sports and other activities they enjoy.  Knee or hip replacements are most often done in people who are 60 and older. However, many people who have this surgery are younger. When a knee or hip replacement is done, the new joint may wear out over time. This is more likely to occur in people with more active lifestyles or in those who will likely live longer after surgery. Unfortunately, if a second joint replacement is needed in the future, it may not work as well as the first.

Is There any Harm in Waiting? : For the most part, knee and hip replacement are elective procedures. This means these surgeries are done to provide relief for your pain, not for any other medical reason.  In most cases, delaying surgery should not make joint replacement less effective if you choose to have it in the future. In some cases, the provider may strongly recommend surgery if deformity or extreme wear and tear on the joint affects other parts of your body.  Also, if pain is preventing you from moving around well, the muscles around your joints may become weaker and your bones may become thinner. This may affect your recovery time if you have surgery at a later date.

Why you may not be Able to Have Replacement Surgery : Your provider may recommend against knee or hip replacement surgery if you have any of the following:  - Extreme obesity (weighing over 300 pounds)  - Weak quadriceps, the muscles in the front of your thighs, that can make it very hard for you to walk and use your knee  - Unhealthy skin around the joint  - Previous infection of your knee or hip  - Previous surgery or injuries that do not allow for a successful joint replacement  - Heart or lung problems, which make major surgery more risky  - Other health conditions that may not allow you to recover well from joint replacement surgery)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000693.htm
Answer: In people with diabetes, the body's nerves can be damaged by decreased blood flow and a high blood sugar level. This condition is more likely when the blood sugar level is not well controlled.  About half of people with diabetes develop nerve damage. Symptoms often do not begin until many years after diabetes has been diagnosed. Some persons who have diabetes that develops slowly already have nerve damage when they are first diagnosed.)

ADAM_0001981_Sec2.txt,"Question: What is (are) Hip joint replacement ? (Also called: Hip arthroplasty; Total hip replacement; Hip hemiarthroplasty)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002975.htm
Answer: Your hip joint is made up of two major parts. One or both parts may be replaced during surgery:  -  The hip socket (a part of the pelvic bone called the acetabulum)   -  The upper end of the thighbone (called the femoral head)    The new hip that replaces the old one is made up of these parts:  - A socket, which is usually made of strong metal.  - A liner, which fits inside the socket. It is usually plastic, but some surgeons are now trying other materials, like ceramic. The liner allows the hip to move smoothly.  - A metal or ceramic ball that will replace the round head (top) of your thigh bone.  - A metal stem that is attached to the thigh bone to make the joint more stable.    You will not feel any pain during surgery. You will have one of two types of anesthesia:  - General anesthesia. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain.   -  Regional (spinal or epidural anesthesia). Medicine is put into your back to make you numb below your waist. You will also get medicine to make you sleepy. And you may get medicine that will make you forget about the procedure, even though you will not be fully asleep.    After you receive anesthesia, your surgeon will make a surgical cut to open up your hip joint. Often this cut is over the buttocks. Then your surgeon will:  - Cut and remove the head of your thigh bone  - Clean out your hip socket and remove the rest of the cartilage and damaged or arthritic bone  - Put the new hip socket in place, then insert the metal stem into your thigh bone  - Place the correct-sized ball for the new joint  - Secure all of the new parts in place, sometimes with a special cement  - Repair the muscles and tendons around the new joint  - Close the surgical wound    This surgery takes about 1 - 3 hours.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002975.htm
Answer: Hip replacement surgery results are often excellent. Most or all of your pain and stiffness should go away.  Some people may have problems with infection, loosening, or even dislocation of the new hip joint.  Over time the artificial hip joint will loosen. This can happen after as long as 15 - 20 years. You may need a second replacement.  Younger, more active people may wear out parts of their new hip. It may need to be replaced before the artificial hip loosens.)

Answer: Summary : You had a hip joint replacement surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.

What to Expect at Home : By the time you go home, you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches without needing much help. Most people do not need them after 2 to 4 weeks. Check with your health care provider about when to stop using crutches.  You should also be able to dress yourself with only a little help and be able to get into and out of your bed or a chair by yourself. You should also be able to use the toilet without much help.  You will need to be careful that you do not dislocate your artificial hip, especially in the first few months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions.   You will need to have someone with you at home 24 hours a day for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehab center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities.  Over time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing.

Home Setup : Your bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hips are higher than your knees when you sit on the edge. You will not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.  Keep tripping hazards out of your home.  - Learn to prevent falls. Remove loose wires or cords from areas you walk through to get from one room to another. Remove loose throw rugs. DO NOT keep small pets in your home. Fix any uneven flooring in doorways. Use good lighting.  - Make your bathroom safe. Put hand rails in the bathtub or shower and next to the toilet. Place a slip-proof mat in the bathtub or shower.  - DO NOT carry anything when you are walking around. You may need your hands to help you balance.    Put things where they are easy to reach.   Place a chair with a firm back in the kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and other rooms you will use. This way, you can sit when you do your daily tasks.  Set up your home so that you do not have to climb steps. Some tips are:  - Set up a bed or use a bedroom on the first floor.  - Have a bathroom or a portable commode on the same floor where you spend most of your day.

Activity : You will need to be careful to not dislocate your new hip when you are walking, sitting, lying down, dressing, taking a bath or shower, and doing other activities.   Keep moving and walking once you get home. DO NOT put your full weight on your side with the new hip until your doctor tells you it is okay. Start out with short periods of activity, and then gradually increase them. Your doctor or physical therapist will give you exercises to do at home.  Use your crutches or walker for as long as you need them. Check with your provider before you stop using them.  After a few days you may be able to do simple household chores. DO NOT try to do heavier chores, such as vacuuming or laundry. Remember, you will get tired quickly at first.  Wear a small fanny pack or backpack, or attach a basket or strong bag to your walker, so that you can keep small household items, like a phone and notepad, with you.

Wound Care : Keep your dressing (bandage) on your wound clean and dry. You may change the dressing according to when your provider told you to change it. Be sure to change it if it gets dirty or wet. Follow these steps when you change your dressing:  - Wash your hands well with soap and water.  - Remove the dressing carefully. DO NOT pull hard. If you need to, soak some of the dressing with sterile water or saline to help loosen it.  - Soak some clean gauze with saline and wipe from one end of the incision to the other. DO NOT wipe back and forth over the same area.  - Dry the incision the same way with clean, dry gauze. Wipe or pat in just 1 direction.  - Check your wound for signs of infection. These include severe swelling and redness and drainage that has a bad odor.  - Apply a new dressing the way you were shown.    Sutures (stitches) or staples will be removed about 10 to 14 days after surgery. DO NOT shower until 3 to 4 days after your surgery, or when your provider told you to shower. When you can shower, let water run over your incision but DO NOT scrub it or let the water beat down on it. DO NOT soak in a bathtub, hot tub, or swimming pool.  You may have bruising around your wound. This is normal, and it will go away on its own. The skin around your incision may be a little red. This is normal too.

Self-care : Your provider will give you a prescription for pain medicines. Get it filled when you go home so you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine when you start having pain. Waiting too long to take it will allow your pain to get more severe than it should.  In the early part of your recovery, taking pain medicine about 30 minutes before you increase your activity can help control pain.  You may be asked to wear special compression stockings on your legs for about 6 weeks. These will help prevent blood clots from forming. You may also need to take blood thinners for 2 to 4 weeks to lower your risk of blood clots. Take all your medicines the way your provider told you to.  Your provider will tell you when it is okay to start sexual activity again.  People who have a prosthesis, such as an artificial joint, need to carefully protect themselves against infection. You should carry a medical identification card in your wallet that says you have a prosthesis. You will need to take antibiotics before any dental work or invasive medical procedures. Check with your provider and make sure you tell your dentist that you had a hip replacement and need antibiotics before any dental work.

When to Call Your Doctor : Call your health care provider if you have:  - A sudden increase in pain  - Chest pain or shortness of breath  - Frequent urination or burning when you urinate  - Redness or increasing pain around your incision  - Drainage from your incision  - Blood in your stools, or your stools turn dark  - Swelling in one of your legs (it will be red and warmer than the other leg)  - Pain in your calf  - Fever greater than 101F (38.3C)  - Pain that is not controlled by your pain medicines  - Nosebleeds or blood in your urine or stools if you are taking blood thinners    Also call if you:  - Cannot move your hip as much as you could before  - Fall or hurt your leg on the side that had surgery  - Have increased pain in your hip

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007498.htm
Answer: Summary : Minimally invasive hip replacement is a technique used to perform hip replacement surgeries. It uses a smaller surgical cut. Also, fewer muscles around the hip are cut or detached.

Description : To perform this surgery:  - A cut will be made in one of three places -- on the back of the hip (over the buttock), on the front of the hip (near the groin), or on the side of the hip.  - In most cases, the cut will be 3to 6 inches long. In a regular hip replacement surgery, the cut is 10to 12 inches long.  - The surgeon will use special instruments to work through the small cut.  - Surgery involves cutting and removing bone. The surgeon will remove some muscles and other tissues. Less tissue is removed than in regular surgery. Most of the time, muscles are not cut or detached.   This procedure uses the same type of hip replacement implants as regular surgery.

Why the Procedure is Performed : As in regular surgery, this procedure is done to replace or repair a diseased or damaged hip joint. This technique works better for people who are younger and thinner. Minimally invasive techniques may allow for a quicker recovery and less pain.  You may not qualify for this procedure if   - Your arthritis is quite severe.   - You have medical problems that do not allow you to have this surgery.   Talk with your surgeon about the benefits and risks. Ask if your surgeon has experience with this type of surgery.

After the Procedure : People who have this surgery can have a shorter stay in the hospital and faster recovery. Ask if this procedure is a good choice for you.)

ADAM_0003285_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Pulling a patient up in bed (Also called: Moving a patient in bed)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000429.htm
Answer: Summary : A patient's body may slowly slide when the person is in bed for a long time. The person may ask to be moved up higher for comfort or may need to be moved up so a health care provider can do an exam.

Avoiding injury : You must move or pull someone up in bed the right way to avoid injuring the patient's shoulders and skin. Using the right method will also help protect your back.  It takes at least two people to safely move a patient up in bed.  Friction from rubbing can scrape or tear the person's skin. Common areas at risk for friction are the shoulders, back, buttocks, elbows, and heels.   Never move patients up by grabbing them under their arms and pulling. This can injure their shoulders.

Preparing to move the patient : A slide sheet is the best way to prevent friction. If you do not have one, you can make a draw sheet out of a bed sheet folded in half. Follow these steps to prepare the patient:  - Tell the patient what you are doing.  - Make the bed flat.  - Roll the patient to one side, then place a half rolled-up slide sheet or draw sheet against the person's back.  - Roll the patient onto the sheet and spread the sheet out flat under the person.  - Make sure the head, shoulders, and hips are on the sheet.

Pulling up : The goal is to pull, not lift, the patient toward the head of the bed. The two people moving the patient should stand on opposite sides of the bed. To pull the person up both people should:   - Grab the slide sheet or draw sheet on the side of the bed closest to you.  - Put one foot forward as you prepare to move the patient.  - On the count of three, move the patient by pulling the sheet toward the head of the bed. You may need to do this more than once to get the person in the right position.    If using a slide sheet, remove it when you're done.  If the patient can help you, ask the patient to:  - Bring the chin up to the chest and bend the knees. The patient's heels should remain on the bed.  - Have the patient push with the heels while you pull up.)

ADAM_0004060_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Turning patients over in bed (Also called: Roll patients in bed)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000426.htm
Answer: Summary : Changing a patient's position in bed every 2 hours helps keep blood flowing. This helps the skin stay healthy and prevents bedsores.  Turning a patient is a good time to check the skin for redness and sores.

Getting a patient ready : - Explain to the patient what you are planning to do so the person knows what to expect. Encourage the person to help you if possible.  - Stand on the side of the bed the patient will be turning towards and lower the bed rail.  - Ask the patient to look towards you. This will be the direction in which the person is turning.  - Move the patient to the center of the bed so the person is not at risk of rolling out of the bed. Make sure the rail is up on the side you are turning the person toward.  - The patient's bottom arm should be stretched towards you. Place the person's top arm across the chest.  - Cross the patient's upper ankle over the bottom ankle.    If you are turning the patient onto the stomach, make sure the person's bottom hand is above the head first.

Turning a patient : - If you can, raise the bed to a level that reduces back strain for you. Make the bed flat.  - Get as close to the person as you can.  - Place one of your hands on the patient's shoulder and your other hand on the hip.  - Standing with one foot ahead of the other, shift your weight to your front foot as you gently pull the patient's shoulder toward you. Then shift your weight to your back foot as you gently pull the person's hip toward you.    You may need to repeat steps 3 and 4 until the patient is in the right position.

When the patient is in the right position : - Make sure the patient's ankles, knees, and elbows are not resting on top of each other.  - Make sure the head and neck are in line with the spine, not stretched forward, back, or to the side.  - Return the bed to a comfortable position with the side rails up. Check with the patient to make sure the patient is comfortable. Use pillows as needed.)

MPlusHealthTopics_0000474_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Hip Replacement (Also called: Hip arthroplasty; Hip prosthesis)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hipreplacement.html
Answer: Summary : Hip replacement is surgery for people with severe hip damage. The most common cause of damage is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis causes pain, swelling, and reduced motion in your joints. It can interfere with your daily activities. If other treatments such as physical therapy, pain medicines, and exercise haven't helped, hip replacement surgery might be an option for you.    During a hip replacement operation, the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from your hip joint and replaces them with new, man-made parts.    A hip replacement can       - Relieve pain    - Help your hip joint work better    - Improve walking and other movements       The most common problem after surgery is hip dislocation. Because a man-made hip is smaller than the original joint, the ball can come out of its socket. The surgery can also cause blood clots and infections. With a hip replacement, you might need to avoid certain activities, such as jogging and high-impact sports.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases)

Answer: Summary : As a patient, you have certain rights. Some are guaranteed by federal law, such as the right to get a copy of your medical records, and the right to keep them private. Many states have additional laws protecting patients, and healthcare facilities often have a patient bill of rights.    An important patient right is informed consent. This means that if you need a treatment, your health care provider must give you the information you need to make a decision.    Many hospitals have patient advocates who can help you if you have problems. Many states have an ombudsman office for problems with long term care. Your state's department of health may also be able to help.)

ADAM_0000961_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Conscious sedation for surgical procedures (Also called: Anesthesia - conscious)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007409.htm
Answer: Summary : Conscious sedation is a combination of medicines to help you relax (a sedative) and to block pain (an anesthetic) during a medical or dental procedure. You will probably stay awake but may not be able to speak.  Conscious sedation lets you recover quickly and return to your everyday activities soon after your procedure.

Description : A nurse, doctor, or dentist, will give you conscious sedation in the hospital or outpatient clinic. Most of the time, it will not be an anesthesiologist. The medicine will wear off quickly, so it is used for short, uncomplicated procedures.  You may receive the medicine through an intravenous line (IV, in a vein) or a shot into a muscle. You will begin to feel drowsy and relaxed very quickly. If your doctor gives you the medicine to swallow, you will feel the effects after about 30 to 60 minutes.  Your breathing will slow down, and your blood pressure may drop a little. Your health care provider will monitor you every during your procedure to make sure you are okay. This person will stay with you at all times during the procedure.  You should not need help with your breathing. But you may receive extra oxygen through a mask or IV fluids through a catheter (tube) into a vein.  You may fall asleep, but you will wake up easily to respond to people in the room. You may be able to respond to verbal cues. After conscious sedation, you may feel drowsy and not remember much about your procedure.

Why the Procedure is Performed : Conscious sedation is safe and effective for people who need minor surgery or a procedure to diagnose a condition.  Some of the tests and procedures conscious sedation may be used for are:  - Breast biopsy  - Dental prosthetic or reconstructive surgery  - Minor bone fracture repair  - Minor foot surgery  - Minor skin surgery  - Plastic or reconstructive surgery  - Procedures to diagnose and treat some stomach (upper endoscopy), colon (colonoscopy), lung (bronchoscopy), and bladder (cystoscopy) conditions

Risks : Conscious sedation is usually safe. However, if you are given too much of the medicine, problems with your breathing may occur. A health care provider will be watching you during the whole procedure.  Providers always have special equipment to help you with your breathing, if needed. Only certain qualified health professionals can provide conscious sedation.

Before the Procedure : Tell the health care provider:  - If you are or could be pregnant  - What medicines you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription    During the days before your procedure:  - Tell your provider about allergies or health conditions you have, what medicines you are taking, and what anesthesia or sedation you have had before.  - You may have blood or urine tests and a physical exam.  - Arrange for a responsible adult to drive you to and from the hospital or clinic for the procedure.  - If you smoke, try to stop. Smoking increases the risk for problems such as slow healing. Ask your provider for help quitting.    On the day of your procedure:  - Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.  - DO NOT drink alcohol the night before and the day of your procedure.  - Take the drugs your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Arrive at the hospital or clinic on time.

After the Procedure : After conscious sedation, you will feel sleepy and may have a headache or feel sick to your stomach. During recovery, your finger will be clipped to a special device (pulse oximeter) to check the oxygen levels in your blood. Your blood pressure will be checked with an arm cuff about every 15 minutes.  You should be able to go home 1 to 2 hours after your procedure.  When you are home:  - Eat a healthy meal to restore your energy.  - You should be able to return to your everyday activities the next day.  - Avoid driving, operating machinery, drinking alcohol, and making legal decisions for at least 24 hours.  - Check with your doctor before taking any medicines or herbal supplements.  - If you had surgery, follow your doctor's instructions for recovery and wound care.

Outlook (Prognosis) : Conscious sedation is generally safe, and is an option for procedures or diagnostic tests.)

ADAM_0001700_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about General anesthesia
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007410.htm
Answer: Summary : General anesthesia is treatment with certain medicines that puts you into a deep sleep so you do not feel pain during surgery. After you receive these medicines, you will not be aware of what is happening around you.

Description : Most times, a doctor called an anesthesiologist will give you the anesthesia. Sometimes, a certified and registered nurse anesthetist will take care of you.  The medicine is given into your vein. You may be asked to breathe in (inhale) a special gas through a mask. Once you are asleep, the doctor may insert a tube into your windpipe (trachea) to help you breathe and protect your lungs.  You will be watched very closely while you are asleep. Your blood pressure, pulse, and breathing will be monitored. The health care provider taking care of you can change how deeply asleep you are during the surgery.  You will not move, feel any pain, or have any memory of the procedure because of this medicine.

Why the Procedure is Performed : General anesthesia is a safe way to stay asleep and pain-free during procedures that would:  - Be too painful  - Take a long time  - Affect your ability to breathe  - Make you uncomfortable  - Cause too much anxiety    You may also be able to have conscious sedation for your procedure. Sometimes, though, it is not enough to make you comfortable. Children may need general anesthesia for a medical or dental procedure to handle any pain or anxiety they may feel.

Risks : General anesthesia is usually safe for healthy people. You may have a higher risk of problems with general anesthesia if you:  - Abuse alcohol or medicines  - Have allergies or a family history of being allergic to medicines  - Have heart, lung, or kidney problems  - Smoke    Ask your doctor about these complications:  - Death (rare)  - Harm to your vocal cords  - Heart attack  - Lung infection  - Mental confusion (temporary)  - Stroke  - Trauma to the teeth or tongue  - Waking during anesthesia (rare)

Before the Procedure : Tell your health care provider:  - If you could be pregnant  - What medicines you are taking, even drugs or herbs you bought without a prescription    During the days before the surgery:  - An anesthesiologist will take a complete medical history to determine the type and amount of the anesthesia you need. This includes asking you about any allergies, health conditions, medicines, and history of anesthesia.  - Several days to a week before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking drugs that make it hard for your blood to clot, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and warfarin (Coumadin).  - Ask your provider which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery.  - Always try to stop smoking. Your doctor can help.    On the day of your surgery:  - You will likely be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before the surgery. This is to prevent you from vomiting while you are under the effect of the anesthesia. Vomiting can cause food in the stomach to be inhaled into the lungs. This can lead to breathing problems.  - Take the drugs that your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Arrive at the hospital on time.

After the Procedure : You will wake up tired and groggy in the recovery or operating room. You may also feel sick to your stomach, and have a dry mouth, sore throat, or feel cold or restless until the effect of the anesthesia wears off. Your nurse will monitor these side effects, which will wear off, but it may take a few hours. Sometimes, nausea and vomiting can be treated with other medicines.  Follow your surgeon's instructions while you recover and care for your surgical wound.

Outlook (Prognosis) : General anesthesia is generally safe because of modern equipment, medicines, and safety standards. Most people recover completely and do not have any complications.)

ADAM_0003672_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Spinal and epidural anesthesia (Also called: Intraspinal anesthesia; Subarachnoid anesthesia; Epidural; Peridural anesthesia)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007413.htm
Answer: Summary : Spinal and epidural anesthesia are medicines that numb parts of your body to block pain. They are given through shots in or around the spine.

Description : The doctor who gives you epidural or spinal anesthesia is called an anesthesiologist.  First, the area of your back where the needle is inserted is cleaned with a special solution. The area may also be numbed with a local anesthetic.  You'll likely receive fluids through an intravenous line (IV) in a vein. You may receive medicine through the IV to help you relax or sleep lightly.  For an epidural:  - The doctor injects medicine just outside of the sac of fluid around your spinal cord. This is called the epidural space.  - The medicine numbs, or blocks feeling in a certain part of your body so that you cannot feel pain. The medicine begins to take effect in about 10 to 20 minutes. It works well for longer procedures. Women often have an epidural during childbirth.  - A small tube (catheter) is often left in place. You can receive more medicine through the catheter to help control your pain during or after your procedure.   For a spinal:  - The doctor injects medicine into the fluid in your spinal cord. This is usually done only once, so you will not need to have a catheter placed.  - The medicine begins to take effect right away. It works well for shorter and simpler procedures.   Your pulse, blood pressure and oxygen level in your bloodare checked during the procedure. After the procedure, you will have a bandage where the needle was inserted.

Why the Procedure is Performed : Spinal and epidural anesthesia have fewer side effects and risks than general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). Patients usually recover their senses much faster. Sometimes, they have to wait for the anesthetic to wear off so they can walk.  Spinal anesthesia is often used for genital, urinary tract, or lower body procedures.  Epidural anesthesia is often used during labor and delivery, and surgery in the pelvis and legs.  Epidural and spinal anesthesia are often used when:  - The procedure or labor is too painful without any pain medicine.  - The procedure is in the belly, legs, or feet.  - Your body can remain in a comfortable position during your procedure.  - You want fewer systemic side effects and a shorter recovery than you would have from general anesthesia.

Risks : Spinal and epidural anesthesia are generally safe. Ask your doctor about these possible complications:  - Allergic reaction to the anesthesia used  - Bleeding around the spinal column (hematoma)  - Difficulty urinating  - Drop in blood pressure  - Infection in your spine (meningitis or abscess)  - Nerve damage  - Seizures (this is rare)  - Severe headache

Before the Procedure : Tell your doctor or nurse:  - If you are or could be pregnant  - What medicines you are taking, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription   During the days before the procedure:  - Tell your doctor about any allergies or health conditions you have, what medicines you are taking, and what anesthesia or sedation you have had before.  - If your procedure is planned, you may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot.  - Ask your doctor which medicines you should still take on the day of your procedure.  - Arrange for a responsible adult to drive you to and from the hospital or clinic.  - If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your doctor or nurse for help quitting.   On the day of the procedure:  - You may be told not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before the surgery.  - Do not drink alcohol the night before and the day of your procedure.  - Take the medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Your doctor or nurse will tell you what time to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time.

After the Procedure : After an epidural, the catheter in your back is removed. You lie in bed until you have feeling in your legs and can walk. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired.  After spinal anesthesia, you lie flat in bed for a few hours to keep you from getting a headache. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired.

Outlook (Prognosis) : Most people feel no pain during spinal and epidural anesthesia and recover fully.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/anesthesia.html
Answer: If you are having surgery, your doctor will give you medicine called an anesthetic. Anesthetics reduce or prevent pain. There are three main types:       - Local - numbs one small area of the body. You stay awake and alert.    - Regional - blocks pain in an area of the body, such an arm or leg. A common type is epidural anesthesia, which is often used during childbirth.    - General - makes you unconscious. You do not feel any pain, and you do not remember the procedure afterwards.       You may also get a mild sedative to relax you. You stay awake but may not remember the procedure afterwards. Sedation can be used with or without anesthesia.    The type of anesthesia or sedation you get depends on many factors. They include the procedure you are having and your current health.)

ADAM_0001953_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Hereditary urea cycle abnormality (Also called: Abnormality of the urea cycle - hereditary; Urea cycle - hereditary abnormality)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000372.htm
Answer: Summary : Hereditary urea cycle abnormality is an inherited condition that can cause problems with the removal of waste from the body in the urine.

Causes : The urea cycle is a process in which waste (ammonia) is removed from the body. When you eat proteins, the body breaks them down into amino acids. Ammonia is produced from leftover amino acids, and it must be removed from the body.  The liver produces several chemicals (enzymes) that change ammonia into a form called urea, which the body can remove in the urine. If this process is disturbed, ammonia levels begin to rise.  Several inherited conditions can cause problems with this waste-removal process. People with a urea cycle disorder are missing a gene that makes the enzymes needed to break down ammonia in the body.  These diseases include:  - Argininosuccinic aciduria  - Arginase deficiency  - Carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) deficiency  - Citrullinemia  - N-acetyl glutamate synthetase deficiency (NAGS)  - Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC)   As a group, these disorders occur in 1 in 30,000 newborns. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is the most common of these disorders.  Boys are more often affected by ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency than girls. Girls are rarely affected. Those girls who are affected have milder symptoms and develop the disease later in life.  To get the other types of disorders, you need to receive a non-working copy of the gene from both parents. Sometimes parents don't know they carry the gene until their child gets the disorder.

Symptoms : Typically, the baby begins nursing well and seems normal. However, over time the baby develops poor feeding, vomiting, and sleepiness, which may be so deep that the baby is difficult to awaken. This usually occurs within the first week after birth.  Symptoms include:  - Confusion  - Decreased food intake  - Dislike offoods that contain protein  - Increased sleepiness, difficulty waking up  - Nausea, vomiting

Exams and Tests : The doctor will often diagnose these disorders when the child is still an infant.  Signs may include:  - Abnormal amino acids in blood and urine  - Abnormal level of orotic acid in blood or urine  - High blood ammonia level  - Normal level of acid in blood   Tests may include:  - Genetic tests  - Liver biopsy  - MRI or CT scan

Treatment : Limiting protein in the diet can help treat these disorders by reducing the amount of nitrogen wastes the body produces. Special low-protein infant and toddler formulas are available.  It is important that a health care provider guide protein intake. The health care provider can balance the amount of protein so that the baby has enough to grow, but not enough to cause symptoms.  It is extremely important for people with these disorders to avoid fasting.  People with urea cycle abnormalities must also be very careful under times of stress, such as when they have infections. Stress, such as a fever, can cause the body to break down its own proteins. These extra proteins can make it difficult for the abnormal urea cycle to remove the byproducts.  Develop a plan with your doctor for when you are sick to avoid all protein, drink high carbohydrate drinks, and get enough fluids.  Most patients with urea cycle disorders will need to stay in the hospital at some point. During such times, they may be treated with medicines that help the body remove nitrogen-containing wastes. Dialysis may help rid the body of excess ammonia during extreme illness.

Support Groups : National Urea Cycle Disorders Forum -- www.nucdf.org

Outlook (Prognosis) : How well patients do depends on:  - Which urea cycle abnormality they have  - How severe it is  - How early it is discovered  - How closely they follow a protein-restricted diet   Babies diagnosed in the first week of life and put on a protein-restricted diet right away do well.  Sticking to the diet can lead to normal adult intelligence. Repeatedly not following the diet or having stress-induced symptoms can lead to brain swelling and brain damage.  Major stresses, such as surgery or accidents, can be complicated for these patients. Extreme care is needed to avoid problems during such periods.

Possible Complications : - Coma  - Confusion and eventually disorientation  - Death  - Increases in blood ammonia level  - Swelling of the brain

When to Contact a Medical Professional : If your child has a test that shows increased ammonia in the blood, have the child examined by a genetic or metabolic specialist. If there is a family history of urea cycle disorder, seek genetic counseling before trying to get pregnant.  A dietician is important to help plan and update a protein-restricted diet as the child grows.

Prevention : As with most inherited diseases, there is no way to prevent these disorders. Prenatal testing is available. Genetic testing before an embryo is implanted may be available for those using in vitro fertilization.  Teamwork between parents, the affected child, and doctors can help prevent severe illness.)

Answer: Painful menstrual periods fall into two groups, depending on the cause:  - Primary dysmenorrhea  - Secondary dysmenorrhea    Primary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain that occurs around the time that menstrual periods first begin in otherwise healthy young women. In most cases, this pain not related to a specific problem with the uterus or other pelvic organs. Increased activity of the hormone prostaglandin, which is produced in the uterus, is thought to play a role in this condition.  Secondary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain that develops later in women who have had normal periods. It is often related to problems in the uterus or other pelvic organs, such as:  - Endometriosis  - Fibroids  - Intrauterine device (IUD) made of copper  - Pelvic inflammatory disease  - Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)  - Sexually transmitted infection  - Stress and anxiety)

Answer: Your doctor will examine you and ask questions about your medical history and symptoms, such as:  - How old were you when your periods started?  - Have they always been painful? If not, when did the pain begin?  - When in your menstrual cycle do you experience the pain?  - Is the pain sharp, dull, intermittent, constant, aching, or cramping?  - Are you sexually active?  - Do you use birth control? What type?  - When was your last menstrual period?  - Was the flow of your last menstrual period a normal amount for you?  - Do your periods tend to be heavy or prolonged (lasting longer than 5 days)? Have you passed blood clots?  - Are your periods generally regular and predictable?  - Do you use tampons with menstruation?  - What have you done to try to relieve the discomfort? How effective was it?  - Does anything make the pain worse?  - Do you have any other symptoms?    Tests and procedures that may be done include:  - Complete blood count (CBC)  - Cultures to rule out sexually transmitted infections  - Laparoscopy  - Ultrasound    Treatment depends on what is causing your pain.  Your health care provider may prescribe birth control pills to relieve menstrual pain. If you do notneed them for birth control, you can stop using the pills after 6 to 12 months. Many women continue to have symptom relief even after stopping the medication.  Your doctor may prescribe prescription pain medications. For pain caused by an IUD, your doctor may recommend:  - Waiting 1 year after it was placed. Painful periods go away in many women during this time.  - Removing the IUD and using other types of birth control.  - Changing to a different type of IUD that contains progesterone, which usually makesmenstrual periods lighter and less painful.    Surgery may be needed if other treatments do not help your pain. Surgery may be done to remove endometriosis, cysts, fibroids, scar tissue, or your uterus (hysterectomy).)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/birthcontrol.html
Answer: Birth control, also known as contraception, is designed to prevent pregnancy. Birth control methods may work in a number of different ways:       - Preventing sperm from getting to the eggs. Types include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and contraceptive sponges.    - Keeping the woman's ovaries from releasing eggs that could be fertilized. Types include birth control pills, patches, shots, vaginal rings, and emergency contraceptive pills.    - IUDs, devices which are implanted into the uterus. They can be kept in place for several years.    - Sterilization, which permanently prevents a woman from getting pregnant or a man from being able to get a woman pregnant        Your choice of birth control should depend on several factors. These include your health, frequency of sexual activity, number of sexual partners and desire to have children in the future. Your health care provider can help you select the best form of birth control for you.    NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development)

MPlusHealthTopics_0000256_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Deep Vein Thrombosis ? (Also called: DVT)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/deepveinthrombosis.html
Answer: Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body. Most deep vein clots occur in the lower leg or thigh. If the vein swells, the condition is called thrombophlebitis. A deep vein thrombosis can break loose and cause a serious problem in the lung, called a pulmonary embolism.    Sitting still for a long time can make you more likely to get a DVT. Some medicines and disorders that increase your risk for blood clots can also lead to DVTs. Common symptoms are        -  Warmth and tenderness over the vein     -  Pain or swelling in the part of the body affected     -  Skin redness        Treatment includes medicines to ease pain and inflammation, break up clots and keep new clots from forming. Keeping the affected area raised and applying moist heat can also help. If you are taking a long car or plane trip, take a break, walk or stretch your legs and drink plenty of liquids.)

NHLBI_0000051_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Deep Vein Thrombosis ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dvt
Answer: Espaol
                
Deep vein thrombosis (throm-BO-sis), or DVT, is a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body. Blood clots occur when blood thickens and clumps together.
                
Most deep vein blood clots occur in the lower leg or thigh. They also can occur in other parts of the body.
                
A blood clot in a deep vein can break off and travel through the bloodstream. The loose clot is called an embolus (EM-bo-lus). It can travel to an artery in the lungs and block blood flow. This condition is called pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm), or PE.
                
PE is a very serious condition. It can damage the lungs and other organs in the body and cause death.
                
Blood clots in the thighs are more likely to break off and cause PE than blood clots in the lower legs or other parts of the body. Blood clots also can form in veins closer to the skin's surface. However, these clots won't break off and cause PE.

NHLBI_0000051_Sec4.txt,"Question: What are the symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dvt
Answer: The signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) might be related to DVT itself or pulmonary embolism (PE). See your doctor right away if you have signs or symptoms of either condition. Both DVT and PE can cause serious, possibly life-threatening problems if not treated.
                
Deep Vein Thrombosis
                
Only about half of the people who have DVT have signs and symptoms. These signs and symptoms occur in the leg affected by the deep vein clot. They include:
                
Swelling of the leg or along a vein in the leg
                
Pain or tenderness in the leg, which you may feel only when standing or walking
                
Increased warmth in the area of the leg that's swollen or painful
                
Red or discolored skin on the leg
                
Pulmonary Embolism
                
Some people aren't aware of a deep vein clot until they have signs and symptoms of PE. Signs and symptoms of PE include:
                
Unexplained shortness of breath
                
Pain with deep breathing
                
Coughing up blood
                
Rapid breathing and a fast heart rate also may be signs of PE.)

NHLBI_0000051_Sec7.txt,"Question: How to prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dvt
Answer: You can take steps to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). If you're at risk for these conditions:
                
See your doctor for regular checkups.
                
Take all medicines as your doctor prescribes.
                
Get out of bed and move around as soon as possible after surgery or illness (as your doctor recommends). Moving around lowers your chance of developing a blood clot.
                
Exercise your lower leg muscles during long trips. This helps prevent blood clots from forming.
                
If you've had DVT or PE before, you can help prevent future blood clots. Follow the steps above and:
                
Take all medicines that your doctor prescribes to prevent or treat blood clots
                
Follow up with your doctor for tests and treatment
                
Use compression stockings as your doctor directs to prevent leg swelling
                
Contact your doctor at once if you have any signs or symptoms of DVT or PE. For more information, go to ""What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis?""
                
Travel Tips
                
The risk of developing DVT while traveling is low. The risk increases if the travel time is longer than 4 hours or you have other DVT risk factors.
                
During long trips, it may help to:
                
Walk up and down the aisles of the bus, train, or airplane. If traveling by car, stop about every hour and walk around.
                
Move your legs and flex and stretch your feet to improve blood flow in your calves.
                
Wear loose and comfortable clothing.
                
Drink plenty of fluids and avoid alcohol.
                
If you have risk factors for DVT, your doctor may advise you to wear compression stockings while traveling. Or, he or she may suggest that you take a blood-thinning medicine before traveling.)

ADAM_0000455_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Birth control pill overdose
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002599.htm
Answer: Summary : Birth control pills, also called oral contraceptives, are prescription medicines used to prevent pregnancy. Birth control pill overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose.  This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual overdose. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poisonous Ingredient : Most birth control pills contain one of the following combinations of estrogen and progestin hormones:  - Ethynodiol diacetate and ethinyl estradiol  - Ethynodiol diacetate and mestranol  - Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol  - Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol  - Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol  - Mestranol and norethindrone  - Mestranol and norethynodrel  - Norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol   These birth control pills contain progestin only:  - Norethindrone  - Norgestrel   Other birth control pills may also contain these ingredients.

Where Found : Here are several birth control medicines, with their brand names in parentheses:  - Ethinyl estradiol and ethynodiol diacetate (Demulen)  - Mestranol and ethynodiol diacetate (Ovulen)  - Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Nordette, Tri-Levlen, Triphasil)  - Norethindrone (Micronor, Nor-Q.D.)  - Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (Loestrin, Norlestrin)  - Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (Brevicon, Ortho-Novum 1/35, Modicon, Ortho-Novum 7/7/7, Ovcon)  - Mestranol and norethindrone (Ortho-Novum 1/50)  - Mestranol and norethynodrel (Enovid)  - Norgestrel (Ovrette)  - Norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Lo Ovral, Ovral)   Other birth control pills may also be available.

Symptoms : Symptoms of an overdose of birth control pills include:  - Breast tenderness  - Discolored urine  - Drowsiness  - Heavy vaginal bleeding (2 to 7 days after the overdose)  - Headache  - Emotional changes  - Nausea and vomiting  - Rash

Home Care : Seek medical help right away, and call poison control. Do NOT make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to.  Stop using the birth control pills and use other methods to prevent pregnancy, if desired. The overdose is NOT likely to be life-threatening.

Before Calling Emergency : Have this information ready:  - Person's age, weight, and condition  - The name of the medicine (ingredients and strength, if known)  - When it was swallowed  - The amount swallowed  - If the medicine was prescribed for the person

Poison Control : Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room : A trip to the emergency room (ER) will probably not be necessary. If you do go, take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.  If an ER visit is needed, the provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The person may receive:  - Activated charcoal (in extreme cases)  - Blood and urine tests  - Medicines to treat symptoms

Outlook (Prognosis) : Serious symptoms are very unlikely.)

NHLBI_0000051_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Deep Vein Thrombosis ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dvt
Answer: Blood clots can form in your body's deep veins if:
                
A vein's inner lining is damaged. Injuries caused by physical, chemical, or biological factors can damage the veins. Such factors include surgery, serious injuries, inflammation, and immune responses.
                
Blood flow is sluggish or slow. Lack of motion can cause sluggish or slow blood flow. This may occur after surgery, if you're ill and in bed for a long time, or if you're traveling for a long time.
                
Your blood is thicker or more likely to clot than normal. Some inherited conditions (such as factor V Leiden) increase the risk of blood clotting. Hormone therapy or birth control pills also can increase the risk of clotting.)

ADAM_0001041_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Crying - excessive (0 to 6 months) (Also called: Excessive crying (infants 0 to 6 months))
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003023.htm
Answer: Summary : Infants normally cry about 1 to 3 hours a day. It is perfectly normal for an infant to cry when hungry, thirsty, tired, lonely, or in pain. It is also normal for a baby to have a fussy period in the evening.  But, if an infant cries too often, it may be a sign of something that needs treatment.

Causes : Infants may cry because of any of the following:  - Boredom or loneliness  - Colic  - Discomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or feeling cold  - Hunger or thirst  - Illness  - Infection (a likely cause if the crying is accompanied by irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, or fever. You should call your baby's health care provider)  - Medicines  - Normal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep  - Pain  - Teething

Home Care : Home care depends on the causes. Follow your provider's advice.   If the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.  If crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.  Take your baby's temperature to check for fever. Check your baby head-to-toe for any injuries. Pay particular attention to the fingers, toes, and genitalia. It is not uncommon for a hair to get wrapped around part of your baby, such as a toe, creating pain.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Call the provider if:  - A baby's excessive crying remains unexplained and does not go away in 1 day, despite attempts at home treatment  - The baby has other symptoms, such as fever, along with the excessive crying

What to Expect at Your Office Visit : The provider will examine your baby and ask about the child's medical history and symptoms. Questions may include:  - Is the child teething?  - Is the child bored, lonely, hungry, thirsty?  - Does the child seem to have a lot of gas?  - What other symptoms does the child have? Such as, difficulty waking up, fever, irritability, poor appetite, or vomiting?    The provider will check the infant's growth and development. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the baby has a bacterial infection.)

ADAM_0001283_Sec7.txt,"Question: Do I need to see a doctor for Drug abuse first aid ? (Also called: Overdose from drugs)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000016.htm
Answer: Drug emergencies are not always easy to identify. If you suspect someone has overdosed, or if you suspect someone is experiencing withdrawal, give first aid and seek medical assistance.  Try to find out what drug the person has taken. If possible, collect all drug containers and any remaining drug samples or the person's vomit and take them to the hospital.  The National Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) can be called from anywhere in the United States. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  See: Poison control center - emergency number  The health care provider will perform a history and physical examination. Tests and procedures will be done as necessary.  These may include:  - Activated charcoal and laxatives to help remove swallowed drugs from the body (sometimes given through a tube placed through the nose into the stomach)  - Airway and breathing support, including a face mask, tube through the mouth into the trachea, and breathing machine (ventilator)  - Blood and urine tests  - CT scan of the head, neck, and other areas  - Chest x-ray  - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)  - Intravenous fluids (fluids through a vein)  - Medications to reverse the effects of the drugs  - Psychiatric and social work evaluation and assistance   In serious cases, the person may need to be admitted to the hospital for further observation and treatment.  The outcome will depend on the type and amount of drugs used, the route of entry into the body, and any medical conditions that may be present. Both long- and short-term use of opioids may result in acute or permanent disability, including heart, lung, liver, kidney, and brain damage. Repeated infections may overwhelm the immune system. Death may result from these, as well as other organ system complications.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001956.htm
Answer: Summary : Your health care provider may give you a prescription in different ways, including:   - Writing a paper prescription that you take to a local pharmacy  - Calling or e-mailing a pharmacy to order the medicine  - Sending your prescription to the pharmacy by way of a computer that is linked to the provider's electronic medical record (EMR)    You also need to find out if your health plan will pay for the medicine your provider prescribed.   - Certain types or brands of medicine may not be covered.  - Many health plans require you to pay the pharmacy a portion of the cost of the prescription price. This called a co-pay.    Once you get a prescription from your provider, you may buy the medicine in different ways.   LOCAL PHARMACIES   The most common place for filling a prescription is at a local pharmacy. Some pharmacies are located inside of a grocery or large ""chain"" store.   It is best to fill all prescriptions with the same pharmacy. That way, the pharmacy has a record of all the medicines you are taking. This helps prevent drug interactions.   Your health plan may require you to use certain pharmacies. This means they may not pay for your prescription if you do not use one of these pharmacies. To find a pharmacy that takes your health plan:  - Call the phone number on the back of your insurance card.  - Call the pharmacy you want to use to see if they have a contract with your insurance plan.    To help the pharmacist fill the prescription:   - Make sure all of the information is filled in clearly.  - Bring your insurance card the first time you fill the prescription.  - When calling the pharmacy for a refill, make sure to give your name, the prescription number, and the name of the medicine.    MAIL-ORDER PHARMACIES   Some people and insurance companies choose to use mail-order pharmacies.   - The prescription is sent to the mail-order pharmacy or phoned in by the provider.  - Your medicine may cost less when you order it by mail. However, it may take a week or more for the medicine to get to you.  - Mail order is best used for long-term medicines you use for chronic problems.  - Buy short-term medicines and drugs that need to be stored at certain temperatures at a local pharmacy.    INTERNET (ONLINE) PHARMACIES   Internet pharmacies can be used for long-term medicines and medical supplies.   - The website should have clear directions for filling or transferring your prescription.  - Make sure that the website has clearly-stated privacy policies and other procedures.  - AVOID any website that claims a doctor can prescribe the medicine without seeing you.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000276.htm
Answer: Babies' bodies make the lactase enzyme so they can digest milk, including breast milk.  - Babies born too early (premature) sometimes have lactose intolerance.   - Children who were born at full term often do not show signs of the problem before they are 3 years old.   Lactose intolerance is very common in adults. It is rarely dangerous. Around 30 million American adults have some degree of lactose intolerance by age 20.  - In Caucasians, lactose intolerance often develops in children older than age 5.  - In African Americans, the problem can occur as early as age 2.  - The condition is very common among adults with Asian, African, or Native American heritage.   - It is less common in people of northern or western European background, but still may occur.    An illness that involves or injury your small intestine may cause less of the lactase enzyme to be made. Treatment of these illnesses may improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance. These may include:  - Surgery of the small intestine  - Infections in the small intestine (This is most often seen in children)  - Diseases that damage the small intestines, such as celiac sprue or Crohn's disease   Babies may be born with a genetic defect and are not able to make any of the lactase enzyme.)

Answer: Common kinds of drugs that are misused include depressants, opioids, and stimulants.  DEPRESSANTS  These medicines are also known as tranquilizers and sedatives. They are prescribed to treat anxiety and sleep problems.   Types of drugs and their street names include:  - Barbiturates, such as Amytal, Nembutal, Phenobarbital, Seconal. Street names include barbs, phennies, reds, red birds, tooies, yellows, yellow jackets  - Benzodiazepines, such as Ativan, Halcion, Klonopin Librium, Valium, Xanax. Street names include benzos, blues, candy, chill pills, french fries, downers, sleeping pills, totem poles, tranks, z-bar  - Other sleep medicines, such as Ambien, Sonata, Lunesta. Street names include A- , zombie pills    When used to get high, they cause feelings of well-being, intense happiness, and excitement. As street drugs, depressants come in pills or capsules and are usually swallowed.  Harmful effects of depressants on the body include:  - Decreased attention span  - Impaired judgment  - Lack of coordination  - Lowered blood pressure  - Memory problems  - Slurred speech    Long-time users may have life-threatening withdrawal symptoms if they try to stop the drug abruptly.  OPIOIDS  Opioids are powerful painkillers. They are prescribed to treat pain after surgery or a dental procedure. Sometimes they are used to treat severe cough or diarrhea.  Types of opioids and their street names include:  -  Codeine: There are many medicinesthatcontaincodeine as an ingredient, especially ones for cough such as Robitussin A-C and Tylenol with codeine. Street names for codeine alone include captain cody, cody, little c, and school boy.For Tylenol with codeine, street names includeT1, T2, T3, T4, and dors and fours. Codeine syrup mixed with soda can have street namses such as purple drank, sizzup, or Texas tea.  -  Fentanyl: Drugs include Actiq, Duragesic, Onsolis, and Sublimaze. Street names include apache, china girl, china white, dance fever, friend, goodfella, jackpot, murder 8, percopop, tango and cash.  -  Hydrocodone: Drugs include Lorcet, Lortab, and Vicodin.

Harmful effects of opioids on the body include:  - Constipation  - Dry mouth  - Confusion  - Lack of coordination  - Lowered blood pressure  - Weakness, dizziness, sleepiness    In high doses, opioid intoxication can result, which can cause breathing problems, coma, or death.  STIMULANTS  These are drugs that stimulate the brain and body. They make the messages between the brain and body move faster. As a result, the person is more alert and physically active. Stimulants such as amphetaminesare prescribed to treat health problems such asobesity, narcolepsy, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  Types of stimulants and their street names include:  - Amphetamines, such as Adderall, Biphetamine, and Dexedrine. Street names include bennies, black beauties, crosses, hearts, LA turnaround, speed, truck drivers, uppers.  - Methylphenidate, such as Concerta, Metadate, Quillivant, and Ritalin.

Answer: Treatment begins with recognizing there is aproblem. Once you decide you want to do something about your drug use, the next step is to get help and support.  Treatment programs use behavior modification techniques through counseling (talk therapy). The techniques get you to understand your behaviors and why you use drugs. Involving family and friends during counseling can help support you keep you from going back to using (relapsing).  With some drug addictions, such as opioids, medicines may also be used to help reduce the effects of opioids on the brain. Other medicines may be used to lessen cravings and withdrawal symptoms.  If you have severe withdrawal symptoms, you may need to stay at a residential treatment program. There, your health and safety can be monitored as you recover.)

GHR_0000573_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) lactose intolerance ? (Also called: alactasia; dairy product intolerance; hypolactasia; lactose malabsorption; milk sugar intolerance)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lactose-intolerance
Answer: Lactose intolerance is an impaired ability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Lactose is normally broken down by an enzyme called lactase, which is produced by cells in the lining of the small intestine.  Congenital lactase deficiency, also called congenital alactasia, is a disorder in which infants are unable to break down lactose in breast milk or formula. This form of lactose intolerance results in severe diarrhea. If affected infants are not given a lactose-free infant formula, they may develop severe dehydration and weight loss.  Lactose intolerance in adulthood is caused by reduced production of lactase after infancy (lactase nonpersistence). If individuals with lactose intolerance consume lactose-containing dairy products, they may experience abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, nausea, and diarrhea beginning 30 minutes to 2 hours later.  Most people with lactase nonpersistence retain some lactase activity and can include varying amounts of lactose in their diets without experiencing symptoms. Often, affected individuals have difficulty digesting fresh milk but can eat certain dairy products such as cheese or yogurt without discomfort. These foods are made using fermentation processes that break down much of the lactose in milk.)

GHR_0000573_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to lactose intolerance ? (Also called: alactasia; dairy product intolerance; hypolactasia; lactose malabsorption; milk sugar intolerance)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lactose-intolerance
Answer: Lactose intolerance in infants (congenital lactase deficiency) is caused by mutations in the LCT gene. The LCT gene provides instructions for making the lactase enzyme. Mutations that cause congenital lactase deficiency are believed to interfere with the function of lactase, causing affected infants to have a severely impaired ability to digest lactose in breast milk or formula.  Lactose intolerance in adulthood is caused by gradually decreasing activity (expression) of the LCT gene after infancy, which occurs in most humans. LCT gene expression is controlled by a DNA sequence called a regulatory element, which is located within a nearby gene called MCM6. Some individuals have inherited changes in this element that lead to sustained lactase production in the small intestine and the ability to digest lactose throughout life. People without these changes have a reduced ability to digest lactose as they get older, resulting in the signs and symptoms of lactose intolerance.)

Answer: Penicillin G benzathine and penicillin G procaine injection is used to treat and prevent certain infections caused by bacteria. Penicillin G benzathine and penicillin G procaine injection should not be used to treat sexually transmitted diseases (STD) or early in the treatment of certain serious infections. Penicillin G benzathine and penicillin G procaine injection is in a class of medications called penicillins. It works by killing bacteria that cause infections.  Antibiotics such as penicillin G benzathine and penicillin G procaine injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.)

Answer: Lactose intolerance means that you cannot digest foods with lactose in them. Lactose is the sugar found in milk and foods made with milk. After eating foods with lactose in them, you may feel sick to your stomach. You may also have       -  Gas     -  Diarrhea     -  Swelling in your stomach        Your doctor may do a blood, breath or stool test to find out if your problems are due to lactose intolerance.    Lactose intolerance is not serious. Eating less food with lactose, or using pills or drops to help you digest lactose usually helps. You may need to take a calcium supplement if you don't get enough of it from your diet, since milk and foods made with milk are the most common source of calcium for most people.

Answer: Physical dependence is a normal process that can happen to anyone taking a medication for a long time. It means that the body (including the brain) is adapting to the presence of the drug, and the person may require a higher dosage or a different medication to get relief; this condition is known as tolerance. They may also suffer from withdrawal or feel sick when they stop taking the medication abruptly. However, the symptoms of withdrawal can usually be prevented or managed by a physician, which is why it is so important to talk to a doctor before stopping a medication. Someone who is addicted to a drug may also be physically dependent on it, but rather than benefitting from the drugs effects, an addicted person will continue to get worse with continued or increasing drug abuse.

You can catch hand-foot-mouth disease if:  - A person with the infection sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you.  - You touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contaminated by the virus, such as a toy or doorknob.  - You touch stools or fluid from the blisters of an infected person.    The virus is most easily spread the first week a person has the disease.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000629.htm
Answer: The infection is caused by infestation with any of the following roundworms:  - Necator americanus  - Ancylostoma duodenale  - Ancylostoma ceylanicum  - Ancylostoma braziliense   The first 2 roundworms affect humans only. The last 2 types also occur in animals.  Hookworm disease is common in the moist tropics and subtropics. In developing nations, the disease leads to the death of many children by increasing their risk for infections that their bodies would normally fight off.  There is very little risk of getting the disease in the United States because of advances in sanitation and waste control. The important factor in getting the disease is walking barefoot on ground where there are feces of people who have hookworm.  The larvae (immature form of the worm) enter the skin. The larvae move to the lungs via the bloodstream and enter the airways. The worms are about one half inch long.  After traveling up the windpipe, the larvae are swallowed. After the larvae are swallowed, they infect the small intestine. They develop into adult worms and live there for 1 or more years. The worms attach to the intestinal wall and suck blood, which results in iron deficiency anemia and protein loss. Adult worms and larvae are released in the feces.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/huntington-disease-like-syndrome
Answer: As its name suggests, a Huntington disease-like (HDL) syndrome is a condition that resembles Huntington disease. Researchers have described four HDL syndromes, designated Huntington disease-like 1 (HDL1) through Huntington disease-like 4 (HDL4). These progressive brain disorders are characterized by uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. HDL syndromes occur in people with the characteristic features of Huntington disease who do not have a mutation in HD, the gene typically associated with that disorder.  HDL1, HDL2, and HDL4 usually appear in early to mid-adulthood, although they can begin earlier in life. The first signs and symptoms of these conditions often include irritability, emotional problems, small involuntary movements, poor coordination, and trouble learning new information or making decisions. Many affected people develop involuntary jerking or twitching movements known as chorea. As the disease progresses, these abnormal movements become more pronounced. Affected individuals may develop problems with walking, speaking, and swallowing. People with these disorders also experience changes in personality and a decline in thinking and reasoning abilities. Individuals with an HDL syndrome can live for a few years to more than a decade after signs and symptoms begin.  HDL3 begins much earlier in life than most of the other HDL syndromes (usually around age 3 or 4). Affected children experience a decline in thinking ability, difficulties with movement and speech, and seizures. Because HDL3 has a somewhat different pattern of signs and symptoms and a different pattern of inheritance, researchers are unsure whether it belongs in the same category as the other HDL syndromes.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/huntington-disease-like-syndrome
Answer: In about one percent of people with the characteristic features of Huntington disease, no mutation in the HD gene has been identified. Mutations in the PRNP, JPH3, and TBP genes have been found to cause the signs and symptoms in some of these individuals. HDL1 is caused by mutations in the PRNP gene, while HDL2 results from mutations in JPH3. Mutations in the TBP gene are responsible for HDL4 (also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 17). The genetic cause of HDL3 is unknown.  The PRNP, JPH3, and TBP genes provide instructions for making proteins that are important for normal brain function. The features of HDL syndromes result from a particular type of mutation in any one of these genes. This mutation increases the length of a repeated segment of DNA within the gene, which leads to the production of an abnormal PRNP, JPH3, or TBP protein. The abnormal protein can build up in nerve cells (neurons) and disrupt the normal functions of these cells. The dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in certain areas of the brain underlie the signs and symptoms of HDL syndromes.  Other medical conditions and gene mutations may also cause signs and symptoms resembling Huntington disease. In some affected people, the cause of the disorder is never identified.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis
Answer: The genetic basis of GPA is not well understood. Having a particular version of the HLA-DPB1 gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for developing this condition, although several other genes, some of which have not been identified, may be involved. It is likely that a combination of genetic and environmental factors lead to GPA.  GPA is an autoimmune disorder. Such disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Approximately 90 percent of people with GPA have an abnormal immune protein called an anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) in their blood. Antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but ANCAs attack normal human proteins. Most people with GPA have an ANCA that attacks the human protein proteinase 3 (PR3). A few affected individuals have an ANCA that attacks a protein called myeloperoxidase (MPO). When these antibodies attach to the protein they recognize, they trigger inflammation, which contributes to the signs and symptoms of GPA.  The HLA-DPB1 gene belongs to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. A particular variant of the HLA-DPB1 gene called HLA-DPB1*0401 has been found more frequently in people with GPA, especially those with ANCAs, than in people without the condition.  Because the HLA-DPB1 gene is involved in the immune system, changes in it might be related to the autoimmune response and inflammation in the respiratory tract and kidneys characteristic of GPA. However, it is unclear what specific role the HLA-DPB1*0401 gene variant plays in development of this condition.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000503.htm
Answer: Post-streptococcal GN is a form of glomerulonephritis. It is caused by an infection with a type of streptococcus bacteria. The infection does not occur in the kidneys, but in a different part of the body, such as the skin or throat.  The strep bacterial infection causes the tiny blood vessels in the filtering units of the kidneys (glomeruli) to become inflamed. This makes the kidneys less able to filter the urine.  Post-streptococcal GN is uncommon today because infections that can lead to the disorder are commonly treated with antibiotics. The disorder may develop 1 to 2 weeks after an untreated throat infection, or 3 to 4 weeks after a skin infection.  It may occur in people of any age, but it most often occurs in children ages 6 through 10. Although skin and throat infections are common in children, post-streptococcal GN is a rare complication of these infections.

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis
Answer: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a condition that causes inflammation that primarily affects the respiratory tract (including the lungs and airways) and the kidneys. This disorder is also commonly known as Wegener granulomatosis. A characteristic feature of GPA is inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), particularly the small- and medium-sized blood vessels in the lungs, nose, sinuses, windpipe, and kidneys, although vessels in any organ can be involved. Polyangiitis refers to the inflammation of multiple types of vessels, such as small arteries and veins. Vasculitis causes scarring and tissue death in the vessels and impedes blood flow to tissues and organs.  Another characteristic feature of GPA is the formation of granulomas, which are small areas of inflammation composed of immune cells that aid in the inflammatory reaction. The granulomas usually occur in the lungs or airways of people with this condition, although they can occur in the eyes or other organs. As granulomas grow, they can invade surrounding areas, causing tissue damage.  The signs and symptoms of GPA vary based on the tissues and organs affected by vasculitis. Many people with this condition experience a vague feeling of discomfort (malaise), fever, weight loss, or other general symptoms of the body's immune reaction. In most people with GPA, inflammation begins in the vessels of the respiratory tract, leading to nasal congestion, frequent nosebleeds, shortness of breath, or coughing. Severe inflammation in the nose can lead to a hole in the tissue that separates the two nostrils (nasal septum perforation) or a collapse of the septum, causing a sunken bridge of the nose (saddle nose).  The kidneys are commonly affected in people with GPA. Tissue damage caused by vasculitis in the kidneys can lead to decreased kidney function, which may cause increased blood pressure or blood in the urine, and life-threatening kidney failure. Inflammation can also occur in other regions of the body, including the eyes, middle and inner ear structures, skin, joints, nerves, heart, and brain. Depending on which systems are involved, additional symptoms can include skin rashes, inner ear pain, swollen and painful joints, and numbness or tingling in the limbs.  GPA is most common in middle-aged adults, although it can occur at any age. If untreated, the condition is usually fatal within 2 years of diagnosis. Even after treatment, vasculitis can return.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000313.htm
Answer: Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy.   When you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy.  When sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes usually develops slowly over time. Most people with the disease are overweight or obese when they are diagnosed. Increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way.  Type 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are thin. This is more common in older adults.  Family history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. Low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease.)

Infection can also cause pain and itching in other parts of the body.  - Diabetes may make it harder to control your blood pressure and cholesterol. This can lead to a heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to your legs and feet.  - Nerves in your body can get damaged, causing pain, tingling, and numbness.  - Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can make it harder for men to have an erection.  - High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage. Your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. They may even stop working so that you need dialysis or a kidney transplant.)

ADAM_0004066_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Type 2 diabetes - self-care ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000328.htm
Answer: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic (lifelong) disease. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body has trouble using the insulin it normally makes. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas to control blood sugar. When your body's insulin is not used correctly, the sugar from food stays in the blood and the level can get too high. Over time, people with type 2 diabetes may not have enough insulin.  Most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight when they are diagnosed. Type 2 diabetes usually happens slowly.  Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your healthcare provider about seeing a diabetes educator.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/diabetestype2.html
Answer: Diabetes means your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth.    You have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if you are older, obese, have a family history of diabetes, or do not exercise. Having prediabetes also increases your risk. Prediabetes means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes.    The symptoms of type 2 diabetes appear slowly. Some people do not notice symptoms at all. The symptoms can include       - Being very thirsty    - Urinating often    - Feeling very hungry or tired    - Losing weight without trying    - Having sores that heal slowly    - Having blurry eyesight       Blood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test, the A1C, can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Many people can manage their diabetes through healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing. Some people also need to take diabetes medicines.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001214.htm
Answer: Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.  To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested:  - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.  - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.     People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the bloodinto muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and because their liver makestoo much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:  - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin  - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally  - Both of the above    There are 2 major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:   - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown.  - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease.Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should.  - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2.    Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.  If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease.)

Answer: Q fever is caused by the bacteria Coxiella burnetii, which live in domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, birds, and cats. Some wild animals and ticks also carry the bacteria.  You can get Q fever by drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk, or afterbreathing indust or droplets in the air that are contaminated with infected animal feces, blood, or birth products.  Symptoms usually develop 2 to 3 weeks after coming in contact with the bacteria. This timeis called the incubation period. Most people have no symptoms. Others may have moderately severe symptoms similar to the flu. If symptoms occur, they may last for several weeks.  People at risk for infection include slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, researchers, food processors, and sheep and cattle workers. Men are infected more often than women. Most people who get Q fever are between 30 and 70 years old.  This disease is occasionally seen in children, especially those who live on a farm.

Answer: Summary : It is hard to quit smoking if you are acting alone. Smokers may have a much better chance of quitting with a support program. Stop smoking programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations.  You can find out about smoking cessation programs from:   - Your doctor or local hospital  - Your health insurance plan  - Your employer  - Your local health department  - The National Cancer Institute at 877-448-7848  - The American Cancer Society's Quitline at 800-227-2345  - The American Lung Association, which has online and phone advice programs  - State programs in all 50 states and the District of Columbia    The best smoking cessation programs combine numerous approaches and target the fears and problems you have when quitting. They also provide ongoing support for staying away from tobacco.  Be wary of programs that:  - Are short and offer no help over time  - Charge a high fee  - Offer supplements or pills that are only available through the program  - Promise an easy path to quitting    Telephone-based help  Telephone-based services can help you design a stop smoking program that meets your needs. These services are easy to use. The counselors can help you avoid common mistakes. This kind of support can be as effective as face-to-face counseling.  Telephone programs are often available on nights and weekends. Trained counselors will help you set up a support network for quitting and help you decide which stop smoking aids to use. Choices may include:  - Medicines  - Nicotine replacement therapy  - Support programs or classes    Support groups  Let your friends, family, and coworkers know of your plans to stop smoking and your quit date. It helps for people around you to be aware of what you are going through, especially when you are grumpy.  You may also want to seek out other types of support, such as:  - Your family doctor or nurse.  - Groups of ex-smokers.  - Nicotine Anonymous. This organization uses a similar approach as Alcoholics Anonymous. As part of this group, you will be asked to admit that you are powerless over your addiction to nicotine. Also, a sponsor is often available to help you get through urges to smoke.    Stop smoking programs and classes  Stop smoking programs can also help you find a quitting method that suits your needs. They will help you be aware of problems that come up while you're trying to quit and offer tools to cope with these problems. These programs can help you avoid making common mistakes.   Programs may either have one-on-one sessions or group counseling. Some programs offer both. Programs should be run by counselors who are trained to help people quit smoking.  Programs that provide more sessions or longer sessions have a better chance of success. The American Cancer Society recommends programs like the following:  - Each session lasts at least 15 to 30 minutes.  - There are at least 4 sessions.  - The program lasts at least 2 weeks, although longer is usually better.  - The leader is trained in smoking cessation.    Internet-based programs are also becoming more available. These services send you personalized reminders using e-mail, texting, or other methods.)

The eye doctor will look for specific changes in the macula and blood vessels and for drusen.  You may be asked to cover one eye and look at a pattern of lines called an Amsler grid. If the straight lineslook wavy, it may be a sign of AMD.  Other tests that may be done include:  -  Using special dye and camera to look at blood flow in the retina (fluorescein angiogram)   - Taking a photo of the inner lining of the eye (fundus photography)  - Using light waves to view the retina (optical coherence tomography)  - A test that measures the pigment in the macula)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/age-related-macular-degeneration
Answer: Age-related macular degeneration is an eye disease that is a leading cause of vision loss in older people in developed countries. The vision loss usually becomes noticeable in a person's sixties or seventies and tends to worsen over time.  Age-related macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The vision loss in this condition results from a gradual deterioration of light-sensing cells in the tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color (the retina). Specifically, age-related macular degeneration affects a small area near the center of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for central vision. Side (peripheral) vision and night vision are generally not affected.  Researchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration, known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and slowly progressive vision loss. The condition typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other.  The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly. This form of the condition is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision appear blurry and distorted.)

GHR_0000027_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to age-related macular degeneration ? (Also called: age-related maculopathy; AMD; ARMD; macular degeneration, age-related)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/age-related-macular-degeneration
Answer: Age-related macular degeneration results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Many of these factors have been identified, but some remain unknown.  Researchers have considered changes in many genes as possible risk factors for age-related macular degeneration. The best-studied of these genes are involved in a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. This system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. Genetic changes in and around several complement system genes, including the CFH gene, contribute to a person's risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. It is unclear how these genetic changes are related to the retinal damage and vision loss characteristic of this condition.  Changes on the long (q) arm of chromosome 10 in a region known as 10q26 are also associated with an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration. The 10q26 region contains two genes of interest, ARMS2 and HTRA1. Changes in both genes have been studied as possible risk factors for the disease. However, because the two genes are so close together, it is difficult to tell which gene is associated with age-related macular degeneration risk, or whether increased risk results from variations in both genes.  Other genes that are associated with age-related macular degeneration include genes involved in transporting and processing high-density lipoprotein (HDL, also known as ""good"" cholesterol) and genes that have been associated with other forms of macular disease.  Researchers have also examined nongenetic factors that contribute to the risk of age-related macular degeneration. Age appears to be the most important risk factor; the chance of developing the condition increases significantly as a person gets older. Smoking is another established risk factor for age-related macular degeneration. Other factors that may increase the risk of this condition include high blood pressure, heart disease, a high-fat diet or one that is low in certain nutrients (such as antioxidants and zinc), obesity, and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight. However, studies of these factors in age-related macular degeneration have had conflicting results)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/maculardegeneration.html
Answer: Macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. It is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving.     AMD affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked.    Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision.    NIH: National Eye Institute)

Answer: There's no way around it. Smoking is bad for your health. Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body. Cigarette smoking causes 87 percent of lung cancer deaths. It is also responsible for many other cancers and health problems. These include lung disease, heart and blood vessel disease, stroke and cataracts. Women who smoke have a greater chance of certain pregnancy problems or having a baby die from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Your smoke is also bad for other people - they breathe in your smoke secondhand and can get many of the same problems as smokers do.    E-cigarettes often look like cigarettes, but they work differently. They are battery-operated smoking devices. Not much is known about the health risks of using them.    Quitting smoking can reduce your risk of health problems. The earlier you quit, the greater the benefit.     NIH: National Cancer Institute)

ADAM_0000139_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Alcohol and pregnancy (Also called: Drinking alcohol during pregnancy)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007454.htm
Answer: Summary : Pregnant women are strongly urged not to drink alcohol during pregnancy.  Drinking alcohol while pregnant has been shown to cause harm to a baby as it develops in the womb. Alcohol used during pregnancy may also lead to long-term medical problems and birth defects.

Information : When a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, the alcohol travels through her blood and into the baby's blood, tissues, and organs. Alcohol breaks down much more slowly in the baby's body than in an adult. That means the baby's blood alcohol level remains increased longer than the mother's. This can harm the baby and can sometimes lead to lifelong damage.  DANGERS OF ALCOHOL DURING PREGNANCY  Drinking a lot of alcohol during pregnancy can lead to a group of defects in the baby known as fetal alcohol syndrome. Symptoms can include:  - Behavior and attention problems  - Heart defects  - Changes in the shape of the face  - Poor growth before and after birth  - Poor muscle tone and problems with movement and balance  - Problems with thinking and speech  - Learning problems    These medical problems are lifelong and can range from mild to severe.   Complications seen in the infant may include:  - Cerebral palsy  - Premature delivery  - Miscarriage or stillbirth    HOW MUCH ALCOHOL IS SAFE?  There is no known ""safe"" amount of alcohol use during pregnancy. Alcohol use appears to be the most harmful during the first 3 months of pregnancy; however, drinking alcohol anytime during pregnancy can be harmful.  Alcohol includes beer, wine, wine coolers, and liquor.  One drink is defined as:  - 12 oz of beer  - 5 oz of wine  - 1.5 oz of liquor    How much you drink is just as important as how often you drink.  - Even if you don't drink often, drinking a large amount at one time can harm the baby.  - Binge drinking (5 or more drinks on one sitting) greatly increases a baby's risk of alcohol-related damage.  - Drinking moderate amounts of alcohol when pregnant may lead to miscarriage.  - Heavy drinkers (those who drink more than 2 alcoholic beverages a day) are at greater risk of giving birth to a child with fetal alcohol syndrome.  - The more you drink, the more you raise your baby's risk for harm.    DO NOT DRINK DURING PREGNANCY  Women who are pregnant or who are trying to get pregnant should avoid drinking any amount of alcohol. The only way to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome is to not drink alcohol during pregnancy.  If you did not know you were pregnant and drank alcohol, stop drinking as soon as you find out. The sooner you stop drinking alcohol, the healthier your baby will be.  Choose non-alcoholic versions of beverages you like.   If you cannot control your drinking, avoid being around other people who are using alcohol.  Pregnant women with alcoholism should join an alcohol abuse rehabilitation program. They should also be followed closely by a health care provider.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000895.htm
Answer: In most pregnancies, the fertilized egg travels through the fallopian tube to the womb (uterus). If the movement of the egg is blocked or slowed through the tubes, it can lead to an ectopic pregnancy. Things that may cause this problem include:  - Birth defect in the fallopian tubes  - Scarring after a ruptured appendix  - Endometriosis  - Having had a previous ectopic pregnancy  - Scarring from past infections or surgery of the female organs    The following also increase risk of an ectopic pregnancy:  - Age over 35  - Getting pregnant while having an intrauterine device (IUD)  - Having your tubes tied (tubal ligation): This is more likely 2 or more years after the procedure  - Having had surgery to untie tubes (tubal sterilization) to become pregnant  - Having had many sexual partners  - Some infertility treatments    Sometimes the cause is unknown. Hormones may play a role.  The most common site for an ectopic pregnancy is within one of the two fallopian tubes. In rare cases, ectopic pregnancies can occur in the ovary, abdomen, or cervix.   An ectopic pregnancy can occur even if you use birth control.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy
Answer: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is a liver disorder that occurs in pregnant women. Cholestasis is a condition that impairs the release of a digestive fluid called bile from liver cells. As a result, bile builds up in the liver, impairing liver function. Because the problems with bile release occur within the liver (intrahepatic), the condition is described as intrahepatic cholestasis. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy usually becomes apparent in the third trimester of pregnancy. Bile flow returns to normal after delivery of the baby, and the signs and symptoms of the condition disappear. However, they can return during later pregnancies.  This condition causes severe itchiness (pruritus) in the expectant mother. The itchiness usually begins on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet and then spreads to other parts of the body. Occasionally, affected women have yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Some studies have shown that women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are more likely to develop gallstones sometime in their life than women who do not have the condition.  Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy can cause problems for the unborn baby. This condition is associated with an increased risk of premature delivery and stillbirth. Additionally, some infants born to mothers with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy have a slow heart rate and a lack of oxygen during delivery (fetal distress).)

Answer: If your health care provider suspects a molar pregnancy, a dilation and curettage (D and C) will most likely be recommended.  Sometimes a partial molar pregnancy can continue. A woman may choose to continue her pregnancy in the hope of having a successful birth and delivery. However, these are very high-risk pregnancies. Risks include bleeding, problems with blood pressure, and premature delivery (having the baby before it is fully developed). Also, the condition may become worse. Women need to thoroughly discuss the risks with their health care provider before continuing the pregnancy.   A hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus) may be an option for older women who do not wish to become pregnant in the future.  After treatment, your hCG level will be followed. It is important to avoid another pregnancy and to use a reliable contraceptive for 6 to 12 months after treatment for a molar pregnancy. This time allows for accurate testing to be sure that the abnormal tissue does not grow back. Women who get pregnant too soon after a molar pregnancy are at high risk of having another molar pregnancy.)

Answer: Hydatidiform mole, or molar pregnancy, results from too much production of the tissue that is supposed to develop into the placenta. The placenta feeds the fetus during pregnancy. With a molar pregnancy, the tissues develop into an abnormal growth, called a mass.  There are 2 types of these masses:  - Partial molar pregnancy. There is an abnormal placenta and some fetal development.  - Complete molar pregnancy. There is an abnormal placenta and no fetus.    Both forms are due to problems during fertilization. The exact cause of fertilization problems is unknown.   There are no known ways to prevent these masses from forming.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007584.htm
Answer: Summary : Ankle arthroscopy is surgery that uses a tiny camera and surgical tools to examine or repair the tissues inside or around your ankle. The camera is called an arthroscope. The procedure allows the doctor to detect problems and make repairs to your ankle without making larger cuts in the skin and tissue. This means that you may have less pain and recover more quickly than open surgery.

Description : You will likely receive general anesthesia before this surgery. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or, you will have regional anesthesia. Your leg and ankle area will be numbed so that you do not feel any pain. If you receive regional anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to make you very sleepy during the operation.  During the procedure, the surgeon does the following:  - Inserts the arthroscope into your ankle through a small incision. The scope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view the inside of your ankle.  - Inspects all the tissues of your ankle. These tissues include cartilage, bones, tendons, and ligaments.  - Repairs any damaged tissues. To do this, your surgeon makes 1 to 3 more small incisions and inserts other instruments through them. A tear in a muscle, tendon, or cartilage is fixed. Any damaged tissue is removed.    At the end of the surgery, the incisions will be closed with stitches and covered with a dressing (bandage). Most surgeons take pictures from the video monitor during the procedure to show you what they found and what repairs they made.  Your surgeon may need to do open surgery if there is a lot of damage. Open surgery means you will have a large incision so that the surgeon can get directly to your bones and tissues.

Why the Procedure is Performed : Arthroscopy may be recommended for these ankle problems:  - Ankle pain: Arthroscopy allows the surgeon to explore what is causing your ankle pain.  - Ligament tears: A ligament is a band of tissue that connects bone to bone. Several ligaments in the ankle help keep it stable and allow it to move. Torn ligaments can be repaired with this type of surgery.  - Ankle impingement: Tissues in your ankle can become swollen and sore from overuse. This makes it hard to move the joint. Arthroscopy can remove the tissue so you can move your joint.  - Scar tissue: This can form after an injury to the ankle. This surgery can remove scar tissue.  - Arthritis: Arthroscopy can be used to help reduce pain and improve movement.  - Cartilage injuries: This surgery can be used to diagnose or repair cartilage and bone injuries.  - Loose fragments: These are pieces of bone or cartilage inside the ankle that can cause the joint to lock up. During arthroscopy these fragments can be removed.

Risks : Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:  - Allergic reactions to medicines  - Breathing problems  - Bleeding, blood clot, or infection    Risks of ankle arthroscopy are:  - Failure of surgery to relieve symptoms  - Failure of repair to heal  - Weakness of the ankle  - Injury to tendon, blood vessel, or nerve

Before the Procedure : Tell your health care provider what medicines you are taking. This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.  During the 2 weeks before your surgery:  - You may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), and other medicines.  - Ask your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.  - If you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical conditions, your surgeon will ask you to see your doctor who treats you for these conditions.  - Tell your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day.  - If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your health care provider or nurse for help. Smoking can slow wound and bone healing.  - Tell your doctor about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you may have before your surgery.    On the day of surgery:  - Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking before the procedure.  - Take the medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Follow instructions about when to arrive at the hospital. Arrive on time.

After the Procedure : - You can usually go home the same day after you recover from the anesthesia. You should have someone drive you home.  - Keep your ankle elevated above your heart for 2 to 3 days to help reduce swelling and pain. You can also apply cold packs to reduce swelling.  - Keep your bandage clean and dry. Follow instructions for how to change the dressing.  - You can take pain relievers, if needed, as long as your doctor says it is safe to do so.  - You will need to use a walker or crutches and keep weight off your foot.

Outlook (Prognosis) : Arthroscopy uses small cuts in the skin. Compared to regular surgery, you may have:  - Less pain and stiffness  - Fewer complications  - Faster recovery    The small cuts will heal quickly, and you may be able to resume your normal activities in a few days. But, if a lot of tissue in your ankle had to be repaired, it may take several weeks to heal. How quickly you heal depends on how complicated the surgery was.  You may be shown how to do gentle exercises as you heal. Or, your doctor may recommend that you see a physical therapist to help you regain the full use of your ankle.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007254.htm
Answer: Ankle replacement is surgery to replace the damaged bone and cartilage in the ankle joint. Artificial joint parts (prosthetics) are used to replace your own bones. There are different types of ankle replacement surgeries.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007254.htm
Answer: Ankle replacement surgery is most often done while you are under general anesthesia. This means you will be asleep and not feel the pain.   You may have spinal anesthesia. You can be awake but will not feel anything below your waist. If you have spinal anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to help you relax during the operation.   Your surgeon will make a surgical cut in the front of your ankle to expose the ankle joint. Your surgeon will then gently push the tendons, nerves, and blood vessels to the side. After this:   - Your surgeon will remove the damaged bone and cartilage.    Your surgeon will replace the damaged part of:  - The lower end of your shin bone (tibia)  - The top of your foot bone (talus) that the leg bones rest on  - The metal parts of the new artificial joint are then attached to the cut bony surfaces. A special glue/bone cement may be used to hold them in place.  - A piece of plastic is then inserted between the two metal parts.  - Screws maybe placed to stabilize your ankle.   The surgeon will put the tendons back into place and close the wound with sutures (stitches). You may need to wear a splint, cast, or brace for a while to keep the ankle from moving.)

Answer: What are the signs and symptoms of Symphalangism with multiple anomalies of hands and feet? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Symphalangism with multiple anomalies of hands and feet. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal dermatoglyphics 90% Finger syndactyly 90% Symphalangism affecting the phalanges of the hand 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 50% Macrocephaly 50% Hearing impairment 7.5% Kyphosis 7.5% Tarsal synostosis 7.5% Absent dorsal skin creases over affected joints - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Clinodactyly of the 5th toe - Cutaneous finger syndactyly - Proximal symphalangism (hands) - Reduced proximal interphalangeal joint space - Small hypothenar eminence - Small thenar eminence - Toe syndactyly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.)

MPlusHealthTopics_0000511_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Infectious Arthritis ? (Also called: Septic arthritis)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/infectiousarthritis.html
Answer: Most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. Infectious arthritis is an infection in the joint. The infection comes from a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that spreads from another part of the body. Symptoms of infectious arthritis include       - Intense pain in the joint    - Joint redness and swelling    - Chills and fever    - Inability to move the area with the infected joint       One type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. The reaction is to an infection somewhere else in your body. The joint is usually the knee, ankle, or toe. Sometimes, reactive arthritis is set off by an infection in the bladder, or in the urethra, which carries urine out of the body. In women, an infection in the vagina can cause the reaction. For both men and women, it can start with bacteria passed on during sex. Another form of reactive arthritis starts with eating food or handling something that has bacteria on it.    To diagnose infectious arthritis, your health care provider may do tests of your blood, urine, and joint fluid. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery.)

Answer: Foot, leg, and ankle swelling is common when the person also:  - Is overweight  - Has a blood clot in the leg  - Is older  - Has a leg infection  - Has veins in the legs that cannot properly pump blood back to the heart    Injury or surgery involving the leg, ankle, or foot can also cause swelling. Swelling may also occur after pelvic surgery, especially for cancer.  Long airplane flights or car rides, as well as standing for long periods of time, often lead to some swelling in the feet and ankles.  Swelling may occur in women who take estrogen, or during parts of the menstrual cycle. Most women have some swelling during pregnancy. More severe swelling during pregnancy may be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious condition that includes high blood pressure and swelling.   Swollen legs may be a sign of heart failure, kidney failure, or liver failure. In these conditions, there is too much fluid in the body.  Certain medicines may also cause your legs to swell. Some of these are:  - Antidepressants, including MAO inhibitors and tricyclics   - Blood pressure medicines called calcium channel blockers   - Hormones, such as estrogen (in birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy) and testosterone  - Steroids)

Answer: If you feel pain and stiffness in your body or have trouble moving around, you might have arthritis. Most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. Over time, a swollen joint can become severely damaged. Some kinds of arthritis can also cause problems in your organs, such as your eyes or skin.    Types of arthritis include       - Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It's often related to aging or to an injury.    - Autoimmune arthritis happens when your body's immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common form of this kind of arthritis.    - Juvenile arthritis is a type of arthritis that happens in children.    - Infectious arthritis is an infection that has spread from another part of the body to the joint.    - Psoriatic arthritis affects people with psoriasis.    - Gout is a painful type of arthritis that happens when too much uric acid builds up in the body. It often starts in the big toe.       NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases)

Answer: Most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. Infectious arthritis is an infection in the joint. The infection comes from a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that spreads from another part of the body. Symptoms of infectious arthritis include       - Intense pain in the joint    - Joint redness and swelling    - Chills and fever    - Inability to move the area with the infected joint       One type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. The reaction is to an infection somewhere else in your body. The joint is usually the knee, ankle, or toe. Sometimes, reactive arthritis is set off by an infection in the bladder, or in the urethra, which carries urine out of the body. In women, an infection in the vagina can cause the reaction. For both men and women, it can start with bacteria passed on during sex. Another form of reactive arthritis starts with eating food or handling something that has bacteria on it.    To diagnose infectious arthritis, your health care provider may do tests of your blood, urine, and joint fluid. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery.)

URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/rheumatoidarthritis/toc.html
Answer: Swelling and Pain in the Joints Different types of arthritis have different symptoms. In general, people with most forms of arthritis have pain and stiffness in their joints. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by inflammation of the joint lining. This inflammation causes warmth, redness, swelling, and pain around the joints. A person also feels sick, tired, and sometimes feverish. Rheumatoid arthritis generally occurs in a symmetrical pattern. If one knee or hand is affected, the other one is also likely to be affected. Diagnostic Tests Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages for several reasons. There is no single test for the disease. In addition, symptoms differ from person to person and can be more severe in some people than in others. Common tests for rheumatoid arthritis include - The rheumatoid factor test. Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that is present eventually in the blood of most people with rheumatoid arthritis However, not all people with rheumatoid arthritis test positive for rheumatoid factor, especially early in the disease. Also, some people who do test positive never develop the disease. The rheumatoid factor test. Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that is present eventually in the blood of most people with rheumatoid arthritis However, not all people with rheumatoid arthritis test positive for rheumatoid factor, especially early in the disease. Also, some people who do test positive never develop the disease. -  The citrulline antibody test. This blood test detects antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP). This test is positive in most people with rheumatoid arthritis and can even be positive years before rheumatoid arthritis symptoms develop. When used with the rheumatoid factor test, the citrulline antibody test results are very useful in confirming a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis.  The citrulline antibody test.

When used with the rheumatoid factor test, the citrulline antibody test results are very useful in confirming a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis. Other common tests for rheumatoid arthritis include - the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which indicates the presence of inflammation in the body  - a test for white blood cell count and  - a blood test for anemia.  the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which indicates the presence of inflammation in the body a test for white blood cell count and a blood test for anemia. Diagnosis Can Take Time Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis can be similar to those of other types of arthritis and joint conditions, and it may take some time to rule out other conditions. The full range of symptoms develops over time, and only a few symptoms may be present in the early stages. Learn more about how rheumatoid arthritis is diagnosed.)

ADAM_0001219_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Diet - clear liquid (Also called: Clear liquid diet)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000205.htm
Answer: Summary : A clear liquid diet is made up of only clear fluids and foods that turn to clear fluids when they are at room temperature. It includes things such as:  - Clear broth  - Tea  - Cranberry juice  - Jell-O  - Popsicles    This diet is easier to digest than other foods. It still gives you the important fluids, salts, and minerals that you need for energy.  Eating only a clear liquid diet gives you enough nutrition for 3 to 4 days. It is safe for people with diabetes, but only for a short time when they are followed closely by their doctor.

Why You May Need This Diet : You may need to be on a clear liquid diet right before a medical test or procedure, or before certain kinds of surgery. It is important to follow the diet exactly to avoid problems with your procedure or surgery or your test results.  You also may need to be on a clear liquid diet for a little while after you have had surgery on your stomach or intestine. You may also need to be on this diet if you:   - Have diarrhea  - Are throwing up  - Are sick to your stomach

What You Can Eat and Drink : You can eat or drink only the things you can see through. Clear fruit juices are ok, but juice with nectar or pulp are NOT ok. Milk is also NOT ok.  You can have these clear liquids:  - Plain water  - Fruit juices without pulp, such as grape juice, filtered apple juice, and cranberry juice  - Soup broth (bouillon or consomm)  - Clear sodas, such as ginger ale and Sprite  - Gelatin (Jell-O)  - Popsicles that do not have bits of fruit or fruit pulp in them  - Tea or coffee with no cream or milk added  - Sports drinks    Try having a mix of 3 to 5 of these choices for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Avoid things that are not on the list, including fruit nectars and canned or frozen fruit.  It is okay to add sugar and lemon to your hot tea. Remember: DO NOT add milk or cream to your tea or coffee.  Your doctor might ask you to avoid liquids that have red coloring for some tests, like a colonoscopy.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003104.htm
Answer: Foot, leg, and ankle swelling is common when the person also:  - Is overweight  - Has a blood clot in the leg  - Is older  - Has a leg infection  - Has veins in the legs that cannot properly pump blood back to the heart    Injury or surgery involving the leg, ankle, or foot can also cause swelling. Swelling may also occur after pelvic surgery, especially for cancer.  Long airplane flights or car rides, as well as standing for long periods of time, often lead to some swelling in the feet and ankles.  Swelling may occur in women who take estrogen, or during parts of the menstrual cycle. Most women have some swelling during pregnancy. More severe swelling during pregnancy may be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious condition that includes high blood pressure and swelling.   Swollen legs may be a sign of heart failure, kidney failure, or liver failure. In these conditions, there is too much fluid in the body.  Certain medicines may also cause your legs to swell. Some of these are:  - Antidepressants, including MAO inhibitors and tricyclics   - Blood pressure medicines called calcium channel blockers   - Hormones, such as estrogen (in birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy) and testosterone  - Steroids)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000226.htm
Answer: When your heart pumps blood into your arteries, the pressure of the blood against the artery walls is called your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is given as two numbers: systolic over diastolic blood pressure. Your systolic blood pressure is the highest blood pressure during the course of your heart beat cycle. Your diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure.  When your blood pressure gets too high, it puts extra stress on your heart and blood vessels. If your blood pressure stays high all the time, you will be at a higher risk for heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease, and other health problems.

Answer: Hidradenocarcinoma is a tumor caused by the abnormal growth of cells in a sweat gland.  It is a type of cancer that usually begins as a single spot (lesion) on the skin of the head or neck, but it has also been found on other parts of the body.  This type of tumor typically develops in older individuals (after age 40).  Each hidradenocarcinoma develops differently over time; some may stay the same size and others grow rapidly.

URL: https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10439/hidradenocarcinoma
Answer: How might hidradenocarcinoma be treated? Because hidradenocarcinoma is quite rare, there are no established guidelines for treatment.  Treatment is determined by the size and location of each particular cancer and the extent to which cancer cells may have spread to nearby lymph nodes or tissues.  Surgery is often the first step and aims to remove as much of the cancer as possible.  Both a traditional surgical technique, known as wide local excision, and the newer Mohs micrographic surgery have been used to remove hidradenocarcinomas.  Radiation therapy, performed by a doctor known as radiation oncologist, has been used after surgery in patients with hidradenocarcinoma to destroy any cancer cells that may remain at the original location of the tumor or in the lymph nodes.  Chemotherapy, performed by a doctor known as a medical oncologist, has not yet been proven as effective treatment for hidradenocarcinomas.)

NHLBI_0000136_Sec4.txt,"Question: What are the symptoms of Vasculitis ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/vas
Answer: The signs and symptoms of vasculitis vary. They depend on the type of vasculitis you have, the organs involved, and the severity of the condition. Some people may have few signs and symptoms. Other people may become very sick.
                
Sometimes the signs and symptoms develop slowly, over months. Other times, the signs and symptoms develop quickly, over days or weeks.
                
Systemic Signs and Symptoms
                
Systemic signs and symptoms are those that affect you in a general or overall way. Common systemic signs and symptoms of vasculitis are:
                
Fever
                
Loss of appetite
                
Weight loss
                
Fatigue (tiredness)
                
General aches and pains
                
Organ- or Body System-Specific Signs and Symptoms
                
Vasculitis can affect specific organs and body systems, causing a range of signs and symptoms.
                
Skin
                
If vasculitis affects your skin, you may notice skin changes. For example, you may have purple or red spots or bumps, clusters of small dots, splotches, bruises, or hives. Your skin also may itch.
                
Joints
                
If vasculitis affects your joints, you may ache or develop arthritis in one or more joints.
                
Lungs
                
If vasculitis affects your lungs, you may feel short of breath. You may even cough up blood. The results from a chest x ray may show signs that suggest pneumonia, even though that may not be what you have.
                
Gastrointestinal Tract
                
If vasculitis affects your gastrointestinal tract, you may get ulcers (sores) in your mouth or have stomach pain.
                
In severe cases, blood flow to the intestines can be blocked. This can cause the wall of the intestines to weaken and possibly rupture (burst). A rupture can lead to serious problems or even death.
                
Sinuses, Nose, Throat, and Ears
                
If vasculitis affects your sinuses, nose, throat, and ears, you may have sinus or chronic (ongoing) middle ear infections. Other symptoms include ulcers in the nose and, in some cases, hearing loss.
                
Eyes
                
If vasculitis affects your eyes, you may develop red, itchy, burning eyes. Your eyes also may become sensitive to light, and your vision may blur. Rarely, certain types of vasculitis may cause blindness.
                
Brain
                
If vasculitis affects your brain, symptoms may include headaches, problems thinking clearly, changes in mental function, or stroke-like symptoms, such as muscle weakness and paralysis (an inability to move).
                
Nerves
                
If vasculitis affects your nerves, you may have numbness, tingling, and weakness in various parts of your body. You also may have a loss of feeling or strength in your hands and feet and shooting pains in your arms and legs.)

MPlusHealthTopics_0000404_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Giant Cell Arteritis ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/giantcellarteritis.html
Answer: Giant cell arteritis is a disorder that causes inflammation of your arteries, usually in the scalp, neck, and arms. It narrows the arteries, which keeps blood from flowing well. Giant cell arteritis often occurs with another disorder called polymyalgia rheumatica. Both are more common in women than in men. They almost always affect people over the age of 50.    Early symptoms of giant cell arteritis resemble the flu: fatigue, loss of appetite, and fever. Other symptoms include       - Headaches    - Pain and tenderness over the temples    - Double vision or visual loss, dizziness    - Problems with coordination and balance    - Pain in your jaw and tongue       Your doctor will make the diagnosis based on your medical history, symptoms, and a physical exam. There is no single test to diagnose giant cell arteritis, but you may have tests that measure inflammation.    Treatment is usually with corticosteroids. Early treatment is important; otherwise there is a risk of permanent vision loss or stroke. However, when properly treated, giant cell arteritis rarely comes back.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007422.htm
Answer: Low back pain is common. Almost everyone has back pain at some time in their life. Often, the exact cause of the pain cannot be found.  A single event may not have caused your pain. You may have been doing many activities, such as lifting the wrong way, for a long time. Then suddenly, one simple movement, such as reaching for something or bending from your waist, leads to pain.  Many people with chronic back pain have arthritis. Or they may have extra wear and tear of the spine, which may be due to:  - Heavy use from work or sports  - Injuries or fractures  - Surgery    You may have had a herniated disk, in which part of the spinal disk pushed onto nearby nerves. Normally, the disks provide space and cushion in your spine. If these disks dry out and become thinner and more brittle, you can lose movement in the spine over time.  If the spaces between the spinal nerves and spinal cord become narrowed, this can lead to spinal stenosis. These problems are called degenerative joint or spine disease.   Other possible causes of chronic low back pain include:  - Curvature of the spine, such as scoliosis or kyphosis  - Medical problems, such as fibromyalgia or rheumatoid arthritis  - Piriformis syndrome, a pain disorder involving a muscle in the buttocks called the piriformis muscle    You are at greater risk for low back pain if you:  - Are over age 30  - Are overweight  - Are pregnant  - Do not exercise  - Feel stressed or depressed  - Have a job in which you have to do heavy lifting, bending and twisting, or that involves whole body vibration, such as truck driving or using a sandblaster  - Smoke)

Answer: During the physical exam, the health care provider will try to pinpoint the location of the pain and figure out how it affects your movement.  Other tests you have depend on your medical history and symptoms.  Tests may include:  - Blood tests, such as a complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate  - CT scan of the lower spine  - MRI scan of the lower spine  - Myelogram (x-ray or CT scan of the spine after dye has been injected into the spinal column)  - X-ray)

Answer: Your back pain may not go away completely, or it may get more painful at times. Learn to take care of your back at home and how to prevent repeat episodes of back pain. This can help you continue with your normal activities.  Your doctor may recommend measures to reduce your pain, including:  - A back brace to support your back  - Cold packs and heat therapy  - Traction  - Physical therapy, involving stretching and strengthening exercises  - Counseling to learn ways to understand and manage your pain    These other health care providers may also help:  - Massage therapist  - Someone who performs acupuncture  - Someone who does spinal manipulation (a chiropractor, osteopathic physician, or physical therapist)    If needed, your doctor may prescribe medicines to help with your back pain:  - Aspirin, naproxen (Aleve), or ibuprofen (Advil), which you can buy without a prescription  - Low doses of prescription medicines  - Narcotics or opioids when the pain is severe    If your pain does not improve with medicine, physical therapy, and other treatments, your doctor may recommend an epidural injection.  Spinal surgery is considered only if you have nerve damage or the cause of the back pain does not heal after a long time.   In some patients, a spinal cord stimulator can help reduce back pain.  Other treatments that may be recommended if your pain does not improve with medicine and physical therapy include:  - Spinal surgery, only if you have nerve damage or the cause of your pain does not heal after a long time  - Spinal cord stimulation, in which a small device sends an electric current to the spine to block pain signals    Some people with low back pain may also need:  - Job changes  - Job counseling  - Job retraining  - Occupational therapy)

Answer: Managing chronic pain means finding ways to make your back pain tolerable so you can live your life. You may not be able to get rid of your pain completely, but you can change some things that worsen your pain. These things are called stressors. Some of them may be physical, like the chair you sit in at work. Some may be emotional, like a difficult relationship.  Reducing stress can improve your physical and emotional health. It is not always easy to reduce stress, but it is easier if you are able to ask your friends and family for help.)

Answer: Pain is a feeling set off in the nervous system. Acute pain lets you know that you may be injured or have a problem you need to take care of. Chronic pain is different. The pain signals go on for weeks, months, or even years. The original cause may have been an injury or infection. There may be an ongoing cause of pain, such as arthritis or cancer. But in some cases there is no clear cause.    Problems that cause chronic pain include       - Headache    - Low back strain    - Cancer    - Arthritis    - Pain from nerve damage       Chronic pain usually cannot be cured. But treatments can help. They include medicines, acupuncture, electrical stimulation and surgery.

NINDS_0000079_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Chronic Pain ?
URL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/chronic_pain/chronic_pain.htm
Answer: While acute pain is a normal sensation triggered in the nervous system to alert you to possible injury and the need to take care of yourself, chronic pain is different. Chronic pain persists. Pain signals keep firing in the nervous system for weeks, months, even years. There may have been an initial mishap -- sprained back, serious infection, or there may be an ongoing cause of pain -- arthritis, cancer, ear infection, but some people suffer chronic pain in the absence of any past injury or evidence of body damage. Many chronic pain conditions affect older adults. Common chronic pain complaints include headache, low back pain, cancer pain, arthritis pain, neurogenic pain (pain resulting from damage to the peripheral nerves or to the central nervous system itself), psychogenic pain (pain not due to past disease or injury or any visible sign of damage inside or outside the nervous system). A person may have two or more co-existing chronic pain conditions. Such conditions can include chronic fatigue syndrome, endometriosis, fibromyalgia, inflammatory bowel disease, interstitial cystitis, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, and vulvodynia. It is not known whether these disorders share a common cause.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000427.htm
Answer: Pain is the main symptom of fibromyalgia. It may be mild to severe.  - Painful areas are called tender points. Tender points are found in the soft tissue on the back of the neck, shoulders, chest, lower back, hips, shins, elbows, and knees. The pain then spreads out from these areas.  - The pain may feel like a deep ache, or a shooting, burning pain.  - The joints are not affected, although the pain may feel like it is coming from the joints.    People with fibromyalgia tend to wake up with body aches and stiffness. For some people, pain improves during the day and gets worse at night. Some people have pain all day long.  Pain may get worse with activity, cold or damp weather, anxiety, and stress.  Fatigue, depressed mood, and sleep problems occur in almost all people with fibromyalgia. Many people say that they cannot get to sleep or stay asleep, and they feel tired when they wake up.  Other symptoms of fibromyalgia may include:  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  - Memory and concentration problems  - Numbness and tingling in hands and feet  - Reduced ability to exercise  - Tension or migraine headaches)

Answer: The goals of treatment are to help relieve pain and other symptoms, and to help a person cope with the symptoms.  The first type of treatment may involve:  - Physical therapy  - Exercise and fitness program  - Stress-relief methods, including light massage and relaxation techniques    If these treatments do not work, your doctor may prescribe an antidepressant or muscle relaxant.  - The goal of these medicines is to improve your sleep and help you better tolerate pain.  - Medicine should be used along with exercise and behavior therapy.  - Duloxetine (Cymbalta), pregabalin (Lyrica), and milnacipran (Savella) are drugs that are approved specifically for treating fibromyalgia.    Other drugs are also used to treat the condition, such as:  - Anti-seizure drugs, such as gabapentin  - Other antidepressants, such as amytriptyline  - Muscle relaxants, such as cyclobenzeprine  - Pain relievers, but avoid narcotics, since they usually do not help  - Sleeping aids    Cognitive-behavioral therapy is an important part of treatment. This therapy helps you learn how to:  - Deal with negative thoughts  - Keep a diary of pain and symptoms  - Recognize what makes your symptoms worse  - Seek out enjoyable activities  - Set limits    Support groups may also be helpful.  Things you can do to help take care of yourself include:  - Eat a well-balanced diet.  - Avoid caffeine.  - Practice a good sleep routine to improve quality of sleep.  - Exercise regularly, starting with low-level exercise.  - Try acupressure and acupuncture treatments.

Answer: Fibromyalgia is a disorder that causes muscle pain and fatigue. People with fibromyalgia have ""tender points"" on the body. Tender points are specific places on the neck, shoulders, back, hips, arms, and legs. These points hurt when pressure is put on them.    People with fibromyalgia may also have other symptoms, such as       - Trouble sleeping    - Morning stiffness    - Headaches    - Painful menstrual periods    - Tingling or numbness in hands and feet    - Problems with thinking and memory (sometimes called ""fibro fog"")       No one knows what causes fibromyalgia.

Answer: There are three levels of burns:  -  First-degree burns affect only the outer layer of the skin. They cause pain, redness, and swelling.  -  Second-degreeburns affect both the outer and underlying layer of skin. They cause pain, redness, swelling, and blistering. They are also called partial thickness burns.  -  Third-degree burns affect the deep layers of skin. They are also called full thickness burns. They cause white or blackened, burned skin. The skin may be numb.    Burns fall into two groups.    Minor burns are:  - First degree burns anywhere on the body  - Second degree burns less than 2-3 inches wide     Major burns include:  - Third-degree burns  - Second-degree burns more than 2-3 inches wide  - Second-degree burnson the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, or a major joint    You can have more than onetype of burn at a time.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000030.htm
Answer: Before giving first aid, it is important to determine what type of burn the person has. If you aren't sure, treat it as a major burn. Serious burns need immediate medical care. Call your local emergency number or 911.   MINOR BURNS  If the skin is unbroken:  - Run cool water over the area of the burn or soak it in a cool water bath (not ice water). Keep the area under water for at least 5 minutes. A clean, cold, wet towel will help reduce pain.  - Calm and reassure the person.  - After flushing or soaking the burn, cover it with a dry, sterile bandage or clean dressing.  - Protect the burn from pressure and friction.  - Over-the-counter ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help relieve pain and swelling. Do NOT give aspirin to children under 12.  - Once the skin has cooled, moisturizing lotion also can help.    Minor burns will usually heal without further treatment. Make sure the person is up to date on tetanus immunization.  MAJOR BURNS  If someone is on fire, tell the person to stop, drop, and roll. Then, follow these steps:  - Wrap the person in thick material; such as a wool or cotton coat, rug, or blanket. This helps put out the flames.  - Pour water on the person.   - Call 911 or your local emergency number.   - Make sure that the person is no longer touching any burning or smoking materials.  - Do NOT remove burned clothing that is stuck to the skin.  - Make sure the person is breathing. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR.  - Cover the burn area with a dry sterile bandage (if available) or clean cloth. A sheet will do if the burned area is large. Do NOT apply any ointments. Avoid breaking burn blisters.  - If fingers or toes have been burned, separate them with dry, sterile, non-sticky bandage.  - Raise the body part that is burned above the level of the heart.   - Protect the burn area from pressure and friction.  - If an electrical injury may have caused the burn, DO NOT touch the victim directly. Use a non-metallic object to move the person away from exposed wires before starting first aid.   You will also need to prevent shock. If the person does not have a head, neck, back, or leg injury, follow these steps:   - Lay the person flat  - Raise the feet about 12 inches  - Cover the person with a coat or blanket    Continue to monitor the person's pulse, rate of breathing, and blood pressure until medical help arrives.)

Answer: Call 911 or your local emergency number if:  - The burn is very large - about the size of your palm or larger  - The burn is severe (third degree).  - You aren't sure how serious it is.  - The burn is caused by chemicals or electricity.  - The person shows signs of shock.  - The person breathed in smoke.  - Physical abuse is the known or suspected cause of the burn.  - There are other symptoms associated with the burn.    For minor burns, call your doctor if you still have pain after 48 hours.  Call immediately if signs of infection develop. These signs include:  - Drainage or pus from the burned skin  - Fever  - Increased pain  - Red streaks spreading from the burn  - Swollen lymph nodes   Also call immediately if symptoms of dehydration occur with a burn:   - Decreased urination  - Dizziness  - Dry skin  - Headache  - Light-headedness  - Nausea (with or without vomiting)  - Thirst    Children, the elderly, and anyone with a weakened immune system (for example, from HIV) should be seen right away.  The health care provider will perform a history and physical examination. Tests and procedures will be done as needed.  These may include:  - Airway and breathing support, including a face mask, tube through the mouth into the trachea, or breathing machine (ventilator) for serious burns or those involving the face or airway  - Blood and urine tests if shock or other complications are present  - Chest x-ray for face or airway burns  - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing), if shock or other complications are present  - Intravenous fluids (fluids through a vein), if shock or other complications are present  - Medications for pain relief and to prevent infection  - Ointments or creams applied to the burned areas  - Tetanus immunization, if not up to date    The outcome will depend on the type (degree), extent, and location of the burn; whether internal organs have been affected, and if other trauma has occurred. Burns can leave permanent scars. They can also be more sensitive to temperature and light than normal skin. Sensitive areas, such as the eyes, nose, or ears, may be seriously injured and lose normal function.   With airway burns, the person may have less breathing capacity and permanent lung damage. Severe burns that affect the joints may result in contractures, where there is decreased movement and a reduction in function.)

CDC_0000054_Sec5.txt,"Question: how can botulism be treated?
URL: http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/botulism/
Answer: The respiratory failure and paralysis that occur with severe botulism may require a patient to be on a breathing machine (ventilator) for weeks or months, plus intensive medical and nursing care. The paralysis slowly improves. Botulism can be treated with an antitoxin which blocks the action of toxin circulating in the blood. Antitoxin for infants is available from the California Department of Public Health, and antitoxin for older children and adults is available through CDC.If given before paralysis is complete, antitoxin can prevent worsening and shorten recovery time. Physicians may try to remove contaminated food still in the gut by inducing vomiting or by using enemas. Wounds should be treated, usually surgically, to remove the source of the toxin-producing bacteria followed by administration of appropriate antibiotics. Good supportive care in a hospital is the mainstay of therapy for all forms of botulism.)

MPlusHealthTopics_0000136_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Burns ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/burns.html
Answer: A burn is damage to your body's tissues caused by heat, chemicals, electricity, sunlight or radiation. Scalds from hot liquids and steam, building fires and flammable liquids and gases are the most common causes of burns. Another kind is an inhalation injury, caused by breathing smoke.    There are three types of burns:       -  First-degree burns damage only the outer layer of skin     -  Second-degree burns damage the outer layer and the layer underneath    -  Third-degree burns damage or destroy the deepest layer of skin and tissues underneath       Burns can cause swelling, blistering, scarring and, in serious cases, shock and even death. They also can lead to infections because they damage your skin's protective barrier. Treatment for burns depends on the cause of the burn, how deep it is, and how much of the body it covers. Antibiotic creams can prevent or treat infections. For more serious burns, treatment may be needed to clean the wound, replace the skin, and make sure the patient has enough fluids and nutrition.

ADAM_0001041_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Crying - excessive (0 to 6 months) (Also called: Excessive crying (infants 0 to 6 months))
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003023.htm
Answer: Summary : Infants normally cry about 1 to 3 hours a day. It is perfectly normal for an infant to cry when hungry, thirsty, tired, lonely, or in pain. It is also normal for a baby to have a fussy period in the evening.  But, if an infant cries too often, it may be a sign of something that needs treatment.

Causes : Infants may cry because of any of the following:  - Boredom or loneliness  - Colic  - Discomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or feeling cold  - Hunger or thirst  - Illness  - Infection (a likely cause if the crying is accompanied by irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, or fever. You should call your baby's health care provider)  - Medicines  - Normal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep  - Pain  - Teething

Home Care : Home care depends on the causes. Follow your provider's advice.   If the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.  If crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.  Take your baby's temperature to check for fever. Check your baby head-to-toe for any injuries. Pay particular attention to the fingers, toes, and genitalia. It is not uncommon for a hair to get wrapped around part of your baby, such as a toe, creating pain.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Call the provider if:  - A baby's excessive crying remains unexplained and does not go away in 1 day, despite attempts at home treatment  - The baby has other symptoms, such as fever, along with the excessive crying

What to Expect at Your Office Visit : The provider will examine your baby and ask about the child's medical history and symptoms. Questions may include:  - Is the child teething?  - Is the child bored, lonely, hungry, thirsty?  - Does the child seem to have a lot of gas?  - What other symptoms does the child have? Such as, difficulty waking up, fever, irritability, poor appetite, or vomiting?    The provider will check the infant's growth and development. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the baby has a bacterial infection.)

ADAM_0001562_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Feeding patterns and diet - children 6 months to 2 years
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000713.htm
Answer: Summary : An age-appropriate diet:  - Gives your child proper nutrition  - Is right for your child's state of development  - Can help prevent childhood obesity

Recommendations : 6 to 8 MONTHS  At this age, your baby will probably eat about 4 to 6 times per day, but will eat more at each feeding than the first 6 months.  - If you feed formula, your baby will eat about 6 to 8 ounces per feeding, but should not have more than 32 ounces in 24 hours.  - You can start to introduce solid foods at age 6 months. Most of your baby's calories should still come from breast milk or formula.  - Breast milk is not a good source of iron. So after 6 months, your baby will start to need more iron in their diet. Start solid feedings with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula. Mix it with enough milk so that the texture is very thin. Start by offering the cereal 2 times a day, in just a few spoonfuls.  - You can make the mixture thicker as your baby learns to control it in her mouth.  - You can also introduce iron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables. Try green peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, pears, bananas, and peaches.  - Some dietitians recommend introducing a few vegetables before fruits. The sweetness of fruit may make some vegetables less appealing.  - The amount your child eats will vary between 2 tablespoons and 2 cups of fruits and vegetables per day. How much your child eats depends on their size and how well they eat fruits and vegetables.    There are several ways you can tell that your baby is ready to eat solid foods:  - Your baby's birth weight has doubled.  - Your baby can control their head and neck movements.  - Your baby can sit up with some support.  - Your baby can show you they are full by turning their head away or by not opening their mouth.  - Your baby begins showing interest in food when others are eating.    You should also know:  - Never give honey to your baby. It may contain bacteria that can cause botulism, a rare but serious illness.  - DO NOT give your baby cow's milk until they are 1 year old. Babies under age 1 have a difficult time digesting cow's milk.  - Never put your child to bed with a bottle. This can cause tooth decay. If your baby wants to suck, give them a pacifier.  - Use a small spoon when feeding your baby.  - It is fine to start to give your baby water between feedings.  - DO NOT give your baby cereal in a bottle unless your pediatrician or dietitian recommends it, for example, for reflux.  - Only offer your child new foods when they are hungry.  - Introduce new foods one at a time, waiting 2 to 3 days between. That way you can watch for allergic reactions. Signs of an allergy include diarrhea, rash, or vomiting.  - Avoid foods with added salt or sugar.  - Feed your baby directly from the jar only if you use the entire jar contents. Otherwise, use a dish to prevent food-borne illness.  - Opened containers of baby's food should be covered and stored in a refrigerator for no longer than 2 days.    8 to 12 MONTHS OF AGE  At this age, you can offer finger foods in small amounts. Your baby will probably let you know they are ready to start feeding themselves by grabbing the food or spoon with their hand.  Good finger foods include:  - Soft cooked vegetables  - Washed and peeled fruits  - Graham crackers  - Melba toast  - Noodles    You can also introduce teething foods, such as:  - Toast strips  - Unsalted crackers and bagels  - Teething biscuits    Continue to offer your baby breast milk or formula 3 to 4 times per day at this age.  You should also know:  - Avoid foods that may cause choking, such as apple chunks or slices, grapes, berries, raisins, dry flake cereals, hot dogs, sausages, peanut butter, popcorn, nuts, seeds, round candies, and raw vegetables.  - You can give your child egg yolks 3 to 4 times per week. Some babies are sensitive to egg whites. So DO NOT offer them until after age 1.  - You can offer small amounts of cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt, but no cow's milk.  - By age 1, most children are off the bottle. If your child still uses a bottle, it should contain water only.    1 YEARof AGE  - At this age, you may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula.  - Most mothers in the U.S. wean their babies by this age. But it is also fine to continue to nurse if you and your baby want to.  - DO NOT give your child low-fat milk (2%, 1%, or skim) until after age 2. Your baby needs the extra calories from fat to grow and develop.  - At this age, your baby will get most of their nutrition from proteins, fruits and vegetables, breads and grains, and dairy. You can make sure your baby gets all the vitamins and minerals they need by offering a variety of foods.  - Your child will start to crawl and walk and be much more active. They will eat smaller amounts at a time, but will eat more often (4 to 6 times a day). Having snacks on hand is a good idea.  - At this age, their growing slows. They will not double in size like they did when they were an infant.    You should also know:  - If your child dislikes a new food, try giving it again later. Often it takes several tries for children to take to new foods.  - DO NOT give your child sweets or sweetened beverages. They can spoil their appetite and cause tooth decay.  - Avoid salt, strong spices, and caffeine products, including soft drinks, coffee, tea, and chocolate.  - If your baby is fussy, they may need attention, rather than food.    2 YEARS of AGE  - After your child turns 2, your child's diet should be moderately low in fat. A high-fat diet can lead to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems later in life.  - Your child should eat a variety of foods from each of the food groups: breads and grains, proteins, fruits and vegetables, and dairy.  - If your water is not fluoridated, it is a good idea to use toothpaste or mouthwash with fluoride added.    All children need plenty of calcium to support their growing bones. But not all kids get enough. Good sources of calcium include:  - Low-fat or nonfat milk, yogurt, and cheese  - Cooked greens  - Canned salmon (with bones)    If your child's diet is balanced and healthy, they should not need a vitamin supplement. Some kids are picky eaters, but usually they still get all the nutrients they need. If you are concerned, ask your health care provider whether your child needs a children's multivitamin.

When to Call Your Child's Health Care Provider : Call the provider if you are concerned your child:  - Is not eating enough  - Is eating too much  - Is gaining too much or too little weight  - Has an allergic reaction to food)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a605042.html
Answer: Most brands of estradiol transdermal patches are used to treat hot flushes (hot flashes; sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating) and/or vaginal dryness, itching, and burning in women who are experiencing menopause (change of life; the end of monthly menstrual periods). Transdermal estradiol is also used to prevent osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) in women who are experiencing or have experienced menopause. Women who need to use transdermal estradiol for more than one of these reasons can benefit most from the medication. Women whose only bothersome symptoms are vaginal dryness, itching, or burning may benefit more from an estrogen product that is applied topically to the vagina. Women who only need a medication to prevent osteoporosis may benefit more from a different medication that does not contain estrogen. Most brands of estradiol transdermal patches are also sometimes used as a source of estrogen in young women who do not produce enough estrogen naturally. Estradiol is in a class of medications called estrogen hormones. It works by replacing estrogen that is normally produced by the body.  Menostar brand patches contain less estrogen than other brands of estradiol transdermal patches. Menostar patches are used only to prevent osteoporosis in women who are experiencing or have experienced menopause.)

MPlusDrugs_0000453_Sec3.txt,"Question: How should Estradiol Transdermal Patch be used and what is the dosage ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a605042.html
Answer: Transdermal estradiol comes as a patch to apply to the skin. Transdermal estradiol is usually applied once or twice a week, depending on the brand of patch that is used. Some women wear a patch all the time, and other women wear a patch according to a rotating schedule that alternates 3 weeks when the patch is worn followed by 1 week when the patch is not worn. Always apply your transdermal patch on the same day(s) of the week every week. There may be a calendar on the inner flap of your medication carton where you can keep track of your patch change schedule. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use transdermal estradiol exactly as directed. Do not apply more or fewer patches or apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Your doctor will start you on a low dose of transdermal estradiol and may increase your dose if your symptoms are still bothersome. If you are already taking or using an estrogen medication, your doctor will tell you how to switch from the estrogen medication you are taking or using to transdermal estradiol. Be sure you understand these instructions. Talk to your doctor about how well transdermal estradiol works for you.  You should apply estradiol patches to clean, dry, cool skin in the lower stomach area, below your waistline. Some brands of patches may also be applied to the upper buttocks or the hips. Ask your doctor or pharmacist or read the manufacturer's information that comes with your patches to find the best place(s) to apply the brand of patches you have received. Do not apply any brand of estradiol patches to the breasts or to skin that is oily, damaged, cut, or irritated. Do not apply estradiol patches to the waistline where they may be rubbed off by tight clothing or to the lower buttocks where they may be rubbed off by sitting. Be sure that the skin in the area where you plan to apply an estradiol patch is free of lotion, powders, or creams. After you apply a patch to a particular area, wait at least 1 week before applying another patch to that spot. Some brands of patches should not be applied to an area of the skin that is exposed to sunlight. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist to find out whether your patch should be applied to an area that will not be exposed to sunlight.  Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or read the manufacturer's information that came with your medication to find out if you need to be careful when you swim, bathe, shower, or use a sauna while wearing an estradiol transdermal patch. Some brands of patches are not likely to be affected by these activities, but some brands of patches may loosen. Some types of patches may also be pulled and loosened by your clothes or towel when you change clothes or dry your body. You may need to check that your patch is still firmly attached after these activities.  If the patch loosens or falls off before it is time to replace it, try to press it back in place with your fingers. Be careful not to touch the sticky side of the patch with your fingers while you are doing this. If the patch cannot be pressed back on, fold it in half so it sticks to itself, throw it away in a trash can that is out of the reach of children and pets, and apply a fresh patch to a different area. Replace the fresh patch on your next scheduled patch change day. Each brand of estradiol transdermal patches should be applied following the specific directions given in the manufacturer's information for the patient. Read this information carefully before you start using estradiol transdermal and each time you refill your prescription. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. The following general directions can help you remember some important things to do when you apply any type of estradiol transdermal patch.   - Tear open the pouch with your fingers. Do not use scissors because they may damage the patch. Do not open the pouch until you are ready to apply the patch.  - Remove the patch from the pouch. There may be a silver foil sticker used to protect the patch from moisture inside the pouch. Do not remove this sticker from the pouch.  - Remove the protective liner from the patch and press the sticky side of the patch against your skin in the area you have chosen to wear your patch. Some patches have a liner that is made to peel off in two pieces. If your patch has that type of liner, you should peel off one part of the liner and press that side of the patch against your skin. Then fold back the patch, peel off the other part of the liner and press the second side of the patch against your skin. Always be careful not to touch the sticky side of the patch with your fingers.  - Press down on the patch with your fingers or palm for 10 seconds. Be sure that the patch is firmly attached to your skin, especially around its edges.  - Wear the patch all the time until it is time to remove it. When it is time to remove the patch, slowly peel it off of your skin. Fold the patch in half so that the sticky sides are pressed together and throw it away in a trash can that is out of reach of children and pets.  - Some brands of patches may leave a sticky substance on your skin. In some cases, this can be rubbed off easily. In other cases, you should wait 15 minutes and then remove the substance using an oil or lotion. Read the information that came with your patches to find out what to do if a substance is left on your skin after you remove your patch.   Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.)

MPlusDrugs_0000453_Sec1.txt,"Question: What important warning or information should I know about Estradiol Transdermal Patch ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a605042.html
Answer: Estradiol increases the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus [womb]). The longer you use estradiol, the greater the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer. If you have not had a hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus), you should be given another medication called a progestin to take with transdermal estradiol. This may decrease your risk of developing endometrial cancer but may increase your risk of developing certain other health problems, including breast cancer. Before you begin using transdermal estradiol, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had cancer and if you have unusual vaginal bleeding. Call your doctor immediately if you have abnormal or unusual vaginal bleeding during your treatment with transdermal estradiol. Your doctor will watch you closely to help ensure you do not develop endometrial cancer during or after your treatment.  In a large study, women who took estrogens (a group of medications that includes estradiol) by mouth with progestins had a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots in the lungs or legs, breast cancer, and dementia (loss of ability to think, learn, and understand). Women who use transdermal estradiol alone or with progestins may also have a higher risk of developing these conditions. Tell your doctor if you smoke or use tobacco, if you have had a heart attack or a stroke in the past year, and if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had blood clots or breast cancer. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had high blood pressure, high blood levels of cholesterol or fats, diabetes, heart disease, lupus ( a condition in which the body attacks its own tissues causing damage and swelling), breast lumps, or an abnormal mammogram (x-ray of the breast used to find breast cancer).  The following symptoms can be signs of the serious health conditions listed above. Call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms while you are using transdermal estradiol: sudden, severe headache; sudden, severe vomiting; speech problems; dizziness or faintness; sudden complete or partial loss of vision; double vision; weakness or numbness of an arm or a leg; crushing chest pain or chest heaviness; coughing up blood; sudden shortness of breath; difficulty thinking clearly, remembering, or learning new things; breast lumps or other breast changes; discharge from nipples; or pain, tenderness, or redness in one leg.  You can take steps to decrease the risk that you will develop a serious health problem while you are using transdermal estradiol. Do not use transdermal estradiol alone or with a progestin to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia. Use the lowest dose of transdermal estradiol that controls your symptoms and only use transdermal estradiol as long as needed. Talk to your doctor every 3 to 6 months to decide if you should use a lower dose of transdermal estradiol or should stop using the medication.  You should examine your breasts every month and have a mammogram and a breast exam performed by a doctor every year to help detect breast cancer as early as possible. Your doctor will tell you how to properly examine your breasts and whether you should have these exams more often than once a year because of your personal or family medical history.  Tell your doctor if you are having surgery or will be on bedrest. Your doctor may tell you to stop using transdermal estradiol 4 to 6 weeks before the surgery or bedrest to decrease the risk that you will develop blood clots.  Talk to your doctor regularly about the risks and benefits of using transdermal estradiol.)

ADAM_0000140_Sec2.txt,"Question: What is (are) Alcohol use and safe drinking ? (Also called: Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001944.htm
Answer: Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.  TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50 -- coma  - 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death    You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.  HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL  Alcohol increases the risk of:  - Alcoholism  - Falls, drownings, and other accidents  - Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers  - Motor vehicle accidents  - Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  - Suicide and homicide    Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.  RESPONSIBLE DRINKING  If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.  Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:  - Never drink alcohol and drive a car.  - If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.  - Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.    If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.  If alcohol use runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.  CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:  - You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member  - You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use or support groups  - You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking    Other resources include:  - Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups  - Local hospitals  - Public or private mental health agencies  - School or work counselors  - Student or employee health centers)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001033.htm
Answer: Sebaceous cysts are the most common type of cysts seen in the ear. These sack-like lumps are made up of dead skin cells and oils produced by oil glands in the skin.  Places they are likely to be found include:   -  Behind the ear   -  In the ear canal   -  In the earlobe   -  On the scalp    The exact cause of the problem is unknown. Cysts may occur when oils are produced in a skin gland faster than they can be released from the gland.  Benign bony tumors of the ear canal (exostoses and osteomas) are caused by excess growth of bone. Repeated exposure to cold water may increase the risk of benign bony tumors of the ear canal.)

ADAM_0000602_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Bubble bath soap poisoning
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002762.htm
Answer: Summary : Bubble bath soap poisoning occurs when someone swallows bubble bath soap.  This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poisonous Ingredient : Most bubble bath soaps are considered nonpoisonous (nontoxic).

Symptoms : Symptoms of swallowing bubble bath soap are:  - Diarrhea  - Vomiting

Home Care : DO NOT make a person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to.   If the soap is in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.  If the person swallowed the soap, give them water or milk right away, unless a provider tells you not to. DO NOT give anything to drink if the person has symptoms that make it hard to swallow. These include vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness.

Before Calling Emergency : Have this information ready:  - Person's age, weight, and condition  - Name of the product (ingredients, if known)  - Time it was swallowed  - Amount swallowed

Poison Control : Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room : A visit to the emergency room may not be needed.  If care is needed, the provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated.   The person may receive:  - Fluids by IV (through a vein)  - Medicine to treat symptoms

Outlook (Prognosis) : Since bubble bath soap is fairly nonpoisonous, recovery is very likely.)

ADAM_0000645_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Caloric stimulation (Also called: Caloric test; Bithermal caloric testing; Cold water calorics; Warm water calorics; Air caloric testing)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003429.htm
Answer: Summary : Caloric stimulation is a test that uses differences in temperature to diagnose damage to the acoustic nerve. This is the nerve that is involved in hearing and balance. The test also checks for damage to the brain stem.

How the Test is Performed : This test stimulates your acoustic nerve by delivering cold or warm water or air into your ear canal. When cold water or air enters your ear and the inner ear changes temperature, it should cause fast, side-to-side eye movements called nystagmus. The test is done in the following way:  - Before the test, your ear, especially the eardrum,will bechecked. This is to make sureit isnormal.  - One ear is tested at a time.  - A small amount of cold water or air is gently delivered into one of your ears. Your eyes should show an involuntary movement called nystagmus. Then they should turn away from that ear and slowly back. If water is used, it is allowed to drain out of the ear canal.  - Next, a small amount of warm water or air is gently delivered into the same ear. Again, your eyes should show nystagmus. Then they should turn toward that ear and slowly back.  - Your other ear is tested in the same way.   During the test, the health care provider may observe your eyes directly. Most often, this test is done as part of another test called electronystagmography.

How to Prepare for the Test : Do not eat a heavy meal before the test. Avoid the following at least 24 hours before the test, because they can affect the results:  - Alcohol  - Allergy medicines  - Caffeine  - Sedatives   Do not stop taking your regular medicines without first talking to yourdoctor.

How the Test will Feel : You may find the cold water or air in the ear uncomfortable. You may feel your eyes scanning back and forth during nystagmus. You may have vertigo, and sometimes, you can also have nausea. This lasts only a very short time. Vomiting is rare.

Why the Test is Performed : This test may be used to find the cause of:  - Dizziness or vertigo  - Hearing loss that may be due to certain antibiotics or other drugs   It may also be done to look for brain damage in persons who are in a coma.

Normal Results : Rapid, side-to-side eye movements should occur when cold or warm water is placed into the ear. The eye movements should be similar on both sides.

What Abnormal Results Mean : If the rapid, side-to-side eye movements do not occur even after ice cold water is given, there may be damage to the:  - Nerve of the inner ear  - Balance sensors of the inner ear  - Brain    Abnormal results may be due to:  - Poor blood supply to the ear  - Bleeding (hemorrhage)  - Blood clot  - Brain or brain stem damage  - Cholesteatoma  - Birth defects of the ear structure or brain  - Damage to the ear nerves  - Poisoning  - Rubella that damages the acoustic nerve  - Trauma    The test may also be done to diagnose or rule out:  - Acoustic neuroma  - Benign positional vertigo  - Labyrinthitis  - Meniere disease

Risks : Too much water pressure can injure an already damaged eardrum. This rarely occursbecause the amount of water to be used is measured.  Water caloricstimulation should not be done if the eardrum is torn (perforated). This isbecause it can cause an ear infection. It also should not bedone during an episode of vertigo because it can make symptoms worse.)

Answer: You have a central venous catheter. This is a tube that goes into a vein in your chest. It helps carry nutrients and medicine into your body. It is also used to take blood when you need to have blood tests.  These catheters are used when people need medical treatment over a long period.  - You may need antibiotics or other medicines for weeks to months.  - You may need extra nutrition because your bowels are not working correctly.  - You may be receiving kidney dialysis.    You will need to make sure the skin where the catheter is placed stays healthy. This will help protect you from infection. You will need to change the dressing as often as your health care provider tells you.You will also need to rinse out the catheter after every use. This is called flushing. Sometimes you will also need to flush it between uses. A friend, family member, caregiver, or your doctor may be able to help you. Follow your provider's instructions on how to flush your catheter.

ADAM_0000861_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Cleaning supplies and equipment
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000443.htm
Answer: Summary : Germs from a person may be found on any object the person touched or on equipment that was used during their care. Some germs can live up to 5 months on a dry surface.  Germs on any surface can pass to you or another person. This is why it is important to disinfect supplies and equipment.  To disinfect something means to clean it to destroy germs. Disinfectants are the cleaning solutions that are used to disinfect. Disinfecting supplies and equipment help prevent the spread of germs.  Follow your workplace policies on how to clean supplies and equipment.

Disinfecting Supplies and Equipment : Start by wearing the right personal protective equipment (PPE). Your workplace has a policy or guidelines on what to wear in different situations. This includes gloves and, when needed, a gown, shoe covers, and a mask. Always wash your hands before putting on gloves and after taking them off.  Catheters or tubes that go into blood vessels are either:  - Used only 1 time and then thrown away  - Sterilized so they can be used again    Clean reusable supplies, such as tubes like endoscopes, with an approved cleaning solution and procedure before they are used again.  For equipment that touches only healthy skin, such as blood pressure cuffs and stethoscopes:  - DO NOT use on one person and then another person.  - Clean with a light or medium-level cleaning solution between uses with different people.    Use cleaning solutions approved by your workplace. Choosing the correct one is based on:  - The type of equipment and supplies you are cleaning  - The type of germs you are destroying    Read and follow directions carefully for each solution. You may need to allow the disinfectant to dry on the equipment for a set period of time before rinsing it off.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003042.htm
Answer: Most of the time, any fluid leaking out of an ear is ear wax.  A ruptured eardrum can cause a white, slightly bloody, or yellow discharge from the ear. Dry crusted material on a child's pillow is often a sign of a ruptured eardrum. The eardrum may also bleed.  Causes of a ruptured eardrum include:  - Foreign object in the ear canal  - Injury from a blow to the head, foreign object, very loud noises, or sudden pressure changes (such as in airplanes)  - Inserting cotton-tipped swabs or other small objects into the ear  - Middle ear infection    Other causes of ear discharge include:  - Eczema and other skin irritations in the ear canal  - Swimmer's ear -- with symptoms such as itching, scaling, a red or moist ear canal, and pain that increases when you move the earlobe)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003042.htm
Answer: The health care provider will perform a physical exam and look inside the ears. You may be asked questions, such as:  -  When did the ear drainage begin?   -  What does it look like?   -  How long has it lasted?   -  Does it drain all the time or off-and-on?   -  What other symptoms do you have (for example, fever, ear pain, headache)?    The health care provider may take a sample of the ear drainage and send it to a lab for examination.  The health care provider may recommend anti-inflammatory or antibiotic medicines, which are placed in the ear. Antibiotics may be given by mouth if a ruptured eardrum from an ear infection is causing the discharge.)

ADAM_0002064_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Hydrogen peroxide poisoning
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002652.htm
Answer: Summary : Hydrogen peroxide is a liquid commonly used to fight germs. Hydrogen peroxide poisoning occurs when large amounts of the liquid are swallowed or get in the lungs or eyes.  This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual overdose. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poisonous Ingredient : Hydrogen peroxide can be poisonous if it is not used correctly.

Where Found : Hydrogen peroxide is used in these products:  - Hydrogen peroxide  - Hair bleach  - Some contact lens cleaners   Note: Household hydrogen peroxide has a 3% concentration. That means it contains 97% water and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Hair bleaches are stronger. They usually have a concentration of more than 6%. Some industrial-strength solutions contain more than 10% hydrogen peroxide.

Symptoms : Symptoms of a hydrogen peroxide poisoning include:  - Abdominal pain and cramping  - Breathing difficulty (if large concentrations are swallowed)  - Body aches  - Burns in the mouth and throat (if swallowed)  - Chest pain  - Eye burns (if it gets in the eyes)  - Seizures (rare)  - Stomach swelling  - Temporary white color to the skin  - Vomiting (sometimes with blood)

Home Care : Seek medical help right away. Do NOT make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to do so. If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.

Before Calling Emergency : Have this information ready:  - Person's age, weight, and condition  - Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)  - Time it was swallowed or got into eyes or on skin  - Amount swallowed, in eyes, or on skin

Poison Control : Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room : Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.  The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.  The person may receive:  - Blood and urine tests  - Chest x-ray  - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)  - Fluids through a vein (by IV)  - Medicines to treat symptoms  - Tube down the throat into the stomach (gastric tube) to relieve gas pressure

Outlook (Prognosis) : Most contact with household-strength hydrogen peroxide is fairly harmless. Exposure to industrial-strength hydrogen peroxide can be dangerous. Passing a tube with a camera through the mouth into the stomach (endoscopy) may be required to stop internal bleeding.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000159.htm
Answer: You have a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). This is a tube that goes into a vein in your arm. It helps carry nutrients or medicine into your body. It is also used to take blood when you need to have blood tests.  These catheters are used when people need intravenous (IV) medical treatment or routine blood drawing over a long period.  You will need to make sure the skin where the catheter is placed stays healthy. This will help protect you from infection. You will need to change the dressing as often as your health care provider tells you.  You will also need to rinse out your catheter after every use. This is called flushing. Sometimes you will need to flush it between uses.  After some practice, flushing your catheter will get easier. A friend, family member, caregiver, or your doctor may be able to help you.  Follow your provider's instructions on how to flush your catheter. Use this sheet to help remind you of the steps.)

ADAM_0003451_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Safe eating during cancer treatment
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000061.htm
Answer: Summary : When you have cancer, you need good nutrition to help keep your body strong. To do this you need to watch the foods you eat and how you prepare them.  Some raw foods can contain germs that can hurt you when cancer or treatment weakens your immune system. Ask your doctor or nurse about how to eat well but safely.  When you eat eggs:  - Yolks and whites should be cooked solid. Do not eat runny eggs.  - Do not eat foods that may have raw eggs in them (such as Caesar salad dressing, cookie dough, cake batter, and hollandaise sauce).    Be careful when you have dairy products:  - All milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy should have the word pasteurized on their containers.  - Do not eat soft cheeses or cheeses with blue veins (such as Brie, Camembert, Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola, and Bleu).  - Do not eat Mexican-style cheeses (such as queso blanco fresco and cojita).    Fruits and vegetables:  - Wash all raw fruits, vegetables, and fresh herbs with cold running water.  - Do not eat raw vegetable sprouts (such as alfalfa and mung bean).  - Do not use fresh salsa or salad dressings that are kept in the refrigerated cases of the grocery store.  - Drink only juice that says pasteurized on the container.    Do not eat raw honey. Eat only heat-treated honey. Avoid sweets that have creamy fillings.

Cook foods safely : When you cook, make sure you cook your food long enough.  Do not eat uncooked tofu. Cook tofu for at least 5 minutes.  When eating chicken and other poultry:  - Cook whole pieces of poultry to 180 F.  - Cook ground poultry to 165 F.    If you cook beef, lamb, pork, or venison:  - Do not eat raw mean, such as Japanese sashimi.  - Make sure meat is not red or pink before you eat it.  - Cook meat to 160 F.    When eating fish, oysters, and other shellfish:  - Do not eat raw fish (such as sushi), raw oysters, or any other raw shellfish.  - Make sure all fish and shellfish you eat is cooked thoroughly.    Heat all casseroles to 165 F. Warm hot dogs and lunch meats to steaming before you eat them.

Be careful when you eat out : When you dine out, stay away from:  - Raw fruits and vegetables  - Salad bars, buffets, sidewalk vendors, potlucks, and delis    Ask if all fruit juices are pasteurized.  Use only salad dressings, sauces, and salsas from single-serving packages. Eat out at times when restaurants are less crowded. Always ask for your food to be prepared fresh, even at fast food restaurants.)

ADAM_0003452_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Safe sex
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001949.htm
Answer: Summary : Safe sex means taking steps before and during sex that can prevent you from getting an infection, or from giving an infection to your partner.

Information : A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that can be spread to another person through sexual contact. STIs include:  - Chlamydia  - Genital herpes  - Genital warts  - Gonorrhea  - Hepatitis  - HIV  - HPV  - Syphilis    STIs are also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  These infections are spread by direct contact with a sore on the genitals or mouth, body fluids, or sometimes the skin around the genital area.  Before having sex:  - Get to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories  - Don't feel forced into having sex  - Don't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner    Your sexual partner should be someone who you know does not have any STI. Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs and share the test results with each other.  If you know you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know this before you have sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.  Use condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.  - The condom should be in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.  - Keep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with skin areas around the genitals. A condom reduces but does not eliminate your risk of getting an STI.    Other tips include:   - Use lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.  - Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.  - Polyurethane condoms are less likely to break than latex condoms, but they cost more.  - Using condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may increase the chance of HIV transmission.  - Stay sober. Alcohol and drugs impair your judgment. When you are not sober, you might not choose your partner as carefully. You may also forget to use condoms, or use them incorrectly.    Get tested regularly for STIs if you have new sexual partners. Most STIs have no symptoms, so you need to be tested often if there is any chance you have been exposed. You will have the best outcome and will be less likely to spread the infection if you are diagnosed early.  Women should consider getting the HPV vaccine to keep from getting the human papillomavirus. This virus can put you at risk for vaginal warts and cervical cancer.)

ADAM_0003842_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Taking multiple medicines safely
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000883.htm
Answer: Summary : If you take more than one medicine, it is important to take them carefully and safely. Some medicines can interact and cause side effects. It can also be hard to keep track of when and how to take each medicine.  Here are tips to help you keep track of your medicines and take them as directed.

Why you may Need More Than one Medicine : You may take more than one medicine to treat a single condition. Or you may take different medicines to treat more than one health problem. For example, you may take a statin to lower your cholesterol, and a beta-blocker to control your blood pressure.   Older adults often have more than one health condition. So they are more likely to take several medicines.

Risks of Taking Multiple Medicines : The more medicines you take, the more you need to use them carefully. There are several risks when taking multiple medicines.  - You may be more likely to have side effects. Because most medicines can have side effects, the more medicines you take, the more likely you will have side effects. Taking certain medicines can also increase the risk of falls.  - You are at higher risk for drug interactions. An interaction is when one medicine affects how another medicine works. For example, taken together, one medicine may make the other medicine stronger. Medicines can also interact with alcohol and even some foods. Some interactions can be serious, even life threatening.  - You may find it hard to keep track of when to take each medicine. You even may forget which medicine you have taken at a certain time.  - You may take a medicine you do not need. This may be more likely to happen if you see more than one health care provider. You may be prescribed different medicines for the same problem.

People at Higher Risk : Certain people are more likely to have problems from taking multiple medicines:  - People who are prescribed 5 or more medicines. The more medicines you take, the higher the chance of interactions or side effects. You may also find it hard to remember all possible drug interactions.  - People who take medicines prescribed by more than one provider. One provider may not know that you are taking medicines another provider has given you.  - Older adults. As you age, your body processes medicines differently. For instance, your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. This can mean that more medicine stays in your body for longer. This can lead to dangerous levels of medicines in your system.  - People in the hospital. When you are in the hospital, you will likely see new providers who are not familiar with your health history. Without this knowledge, they may prescribe a medicine that may interact with medicines you already take.

What you can do : These suggestions can help you take all of your medicines safely:  - Keep a list of all medicines you take. Your list should include all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. OTC medicines include vitamins, supplements, and herbal products. Keep a copy of the list in your wallet and at home.  - Review your medicine list with your health care providers and pharmacists. Discuss the list with your provider each time you have an appointment. Ask your provider if you still need to take all of the medicines on your list. Also ask if any of the dosages should be changed. Make sure you give all of your providers a copy of your medicine list.  - Ask questions about any new drugs you are prescribed. Make sure you understand how to take them. Also ask if a new medicine could interact with any of the medicines or supplements you are already taking.  - Take your medicines exactly as your provider tells you. If you have questions about how or why to take your medicine, ask your provider. DO NOT skip doses, or stop taking your medicines.  - If you notice side effects, tell your health care provider. DO NOT stop taking your medicines unless your provider tells you to.  - Keep your medicines organized. There are many ways to keep track of your medicines. A pill organizer may help. Try one or more methods and see what works for you.  - If you have a hospital stay, bring your medicine list with you. Talk with your provider about medicine safety while you are in the hospital.

When to Call the Doctor : Call if you have questions or you are confused about the directions for your medicine. Call if you have any side effects from your medicines. DO NOT stop taking any medicine unless your health care provider tells you to stop.)

ADAM_0004154_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Using over-the-counter medicines safely
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm
Answer: Summary : Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are drugs you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using OTC the medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.  Here is what you need to know about OTC drugs.

About OTC Medicines : You can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:  - Drug stores  - Grocery stores  - Discount and department stores  - Convenience stores  - Some gas stations    When used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:  - Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea  - Preventing problems like heartburn or motion sickness  - Treating conditions such as athletes foot, allergies, or migraine headaches  - Providing first aid

When Should you Use OTC Medicines : It is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:  - Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition  - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take  - What side effects or problems to watch for    Your pharmacist can answer questions such as:  - What the medicine will do  - How it should be stored  - Whether another medicine might work as well or better

What the Label can Tell you : You can also get information about OTC drugs on the medicine label.  Most OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.  Here is what the label will show you:  - Active Ingredient. This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose.  - Uses. The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, DO NOT use the medicine for any condition not listed.  - Warnings. Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. Some medicines you should not take when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose.  - Directions. The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Fully read the directions, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages.  - Other information. This includes such things as how to store the medicine.  - Inactive ingredients. Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.    The label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.

Other Ways to Use OTC Medicines Safely : You should:  - Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with.  - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place you bought it.  - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container.  - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.    Also be sure to take steps to keep kids safe. You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight.)

Answer: Self-harm refers to a person's harming their own body on purpose. About 1 in 100 people hurts himself or herself in this way. More females hurt themselves than males. A person who self-harms usually does not mean to kill himself or herself. But they are at higher risk of attempting suicide if they do not get help.    Self-harm tends to begin in teen or early adult years. Some people may engage in self-harm a few times and then stop. Others engage in it more often and have trouble stopping.    Examples of self-harm include       - Cutting yourself (such as using a razor blade, knife, or other sharp object to cut the skin)    - Punching yourself or punching things (like a wall)    - Burning yourself with cigarettes, matches, or candles    - Pulling out your hair    - Poking objects through body openings    - Breaking your bones or bruising yourself       Many people cut themselves because it gives them a sense of relief. Some people use cutting as a means to cope with a problem. Some teens say that when they hurt themselves, they are trying to stop feeling lonely, angry, or hopeless.    It is possible to overcome the urge to hurt yourself. There are other ways to find relief and cope with your emotions. Counseling may help.

ADAM_0001324_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Ear wax (Also called: Ear impaction; Cerumen impaction; Ear blockage)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000979.htm
Answer: Summary : The ear canal is lined with hair follicles and glands that produce a waxy oil called cerumen. The wax will most often make its way to the opening of the ear. There it will fall out or be removed by washing.   Wax can build up and block the ear canal. Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss.

Causes : Ear wax protects the ear by:  - Trapping and preventing dust, bacteria, and other germs and smallobjects from entering and damaging the ear   - Protecting the delicate skin of the ear canal from getting irritated when water is in the canal   In some people, the glands produce more wax than can be easily removed from the ear. This extra wax may harden in the ear canal and block the ear. When you try to clean the ear, you may instead push wax deeperand blockthe ear canal.

Symptoms : - Earache  - Fullness in the ear or a sensation that the ear is plugged  - Noises in the ear (tinnitus)  - Partial hearing loss, may get worse

Treatment : Most cases of ear wax blockage can be treated at home. The following remedies can be used to soften wax in the ear:  -  Baby oil   -  Commercial drops   -  Glycerin   -  Mineral oil   -  Water    Another method is to wash out the wax.   - Use body-temperature water (cooler or warmer water may cause brief but severe dizziness or vertigo).  - Hold your head upright andstraighten the ear canal by holding the outside ear and gently pulling upward.  - Use a syringe (you can buy one at the store) to gently direct a small stream of water against the ear canal wall next to the wax plug.  - Tip your head to allow the water to drain. You may need to repeat irrigation several times.    To avoid damaging your ear or causing an infection:  - Never irrigate the ear if the eardrum may have a hole in it.  - Do not irrigate the ear with a jet irrigator designed for cleaning teeth (such as a WaterPik).    After the wax is removed, dry the ear thoroughly. You may use a few drops of alcohol in the ear or a hair dryer set on low to help dry the ear.  You may clean the outer ear canal by using a cloth or paper tissue wrapped around your finger. Mineral oil can be used to moisturize the ear and prevent the wax from drying.  - Do not clean your ears too often or too hard. Ear wax also helps protect your ears.  - Never try to clean the ear by putting any object, such as a cotton swab, into the ear canal.    If you cannot remove the wax plug or you have discomfort, consult a health care provider, who may remove the wax by:  - Repeating the irrigation attempts  -  Suctioning the ear canal   -  Using a small device called a curette   -  Using a microscope to help

Outlook (Prognosis) : The ear may become blocked with wax again in the future. Hearing loss is often temporary. In most cases, hearing returns completely after the blockage is removed.  Rarely, trying to remove ear wax may cause an infection in the ear canal or damage to the eardrum.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : See your health care provider if your ears are blocked with wax and you are unable to remove the wax.  Also call if you have an ear wax blockage and you develop new symptoms, such as:  - Drainage from the ear  - Ear pain  - Fever  - Hearing loss that continues afteryou cleanthe wax)

The following remedies can be used to soften wax in the ear:  -  Baby oil   -  Commercial drops   -  Glycerin   -  Mineral oil   -  Water    Another method is to wash out the wax.   - Use body-temperature water (cooler or warmer water may cause brief but severe dizziness or vertigo).  - Hold your head upright andstraighten the ear canal by holding the outside ear and gently pulling upward.  - Use a syringe (you can buy one at the store) to gently direct a small stream of water against the ear canal wall next to the wax plug.  - Tip your head to allow the water to drain. You may need to repeat irrigation several times.    To avoid damaging your ear or causing an infection:  - Never irrigate the ear if the eardrum may have a hole in it.  - Do not irrigate the ear with a jet irrigator designed for cleaning teeth (such as a WaterPik).    After the wax is removed, dry the ear thoroughly. You may use a few drops of alcohol in the ear or a hair dryer set on low to help dry the ear.  You may clean the outer ear canal by using a cloth or paper tissue wrapped around your finger. Mineral oil can be used to moisturize the ear and prevent the wax from drying.  - Do not clean your ears too often or too hard. Ear wax also helps protect your ears.  - Never try to clean the ear by putting any object, such as a cotton swab, into the ear canal.    If you cannot remove the wax plug or you have discomfort, consult a health care provider, who may remove the wax by:  - Repeating the irrigation attempts  -  Suctioning the ear canal   -  Using a small device called a curette   -  Using a microscope to help

Outlook (Prognosis) : The ear may become blocked with wax again in the future. Hearing loss is often temporary. In most cases, hearing returns completely after the blockage is removed.  Rarely, trying to remove ear wax may cause an infection in the ear canal or damage to the eardrum.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : See your health care provider if your ears are blocked with wax and you are unable to remove the wax.  Also call if you have an ear wax blockage and you develop new symptoms, such as:  - Drainage from the ear  - Ear pain  - Fever  - Hearing loss that continues afteryou cleanthe wax)

ADAM_0000104_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about After a C-section - in the hospital (Also called: Cesarean section - in the hospital)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000620.htm
Answer: Summary : Most women will remain in the hospital for 2 to 3 days after a cesarean delivery. Take advantage of the time to bond with your new baby, get some rest, and receive some help with breastfeeding and caring for your baby.

What to Expect after a C-section : Right after surgery you may feel:  - Groggy from any medicines you received  - Nausea for the first day or so  - Itchy, if you received narcotics in your epidural    You will be brought to a recovery area right after surgery, where a nurse will:  - Monitor your blood pressure, heart rate, and the amount of your vaginal bleeding  - Check to make sure your uterus is becoming firmer  - Bring you to a hospital room once you are stable, where you will spend the next few days    After the excitement of finally delivering and holding your baby, you may notice just how tired you are, like the way one probably feels after running a marathon.  Your belly will be painful at first, but it will improve a lot over 1 to 2 days.  Some women feel sadness or an emotional letdown after delivery. These feelings are not uncommon. DO NOT feel ashamed. Talk with your health care providers and partner.

Seeing and Caring for Your Baby : Breastfeeding can often begin right after surgery. The nurses can help you find the right position. Numbness from your anesthetic can limit your movement for a while, and pain in your incision can make it a little harder to become comfortable, but do not give up. The nurses can show you how to hold your baby so there is no pressure on your incision or abdomen.  Holding and caring for your new infant is exciting, making up for the long journey of your pregnancy and the pain and discomfort of labor. Nurses and breastfeeding specialists are available to answer questions and help you.  Also take advantage of the babysitting and room service the hospital provides for you. You are going home to both the joys of being a mother and the demands of caring for a newborn infant.

Activity : Between feeling exhausted after labor and managing the pain from the surgery, getting out of bed may seem like too big of a task.  But getting out of bed at least once or twice a day at first can help speed your recovery. It also decreases your chance of having blood clots and helps your bowels move.  Make sure someone is around to help you in case you get dizzy or weak. Plan on taking your walks soon after you have received some pain medicine.

Contractions and Bleeding : Once you deliver, the heavy contractions are over. But your uterus still needs to contract to shrink back to its normal size and prevent heavy bleeding. Breastfeeding also helps your uterus contract. These contractions may be somewhat painful, but they are important.  As your uterus becomes firmer and smaller, you are less likely to have heavy bleeding. Blood flow should gradually become slower during your first day. You may notice a few smaller clots passing when the nurse presses on your uterus to check it.

Pain Relief : Your epidural, or spinal, catheter can also be used for pain relief after surgery. It may be left in for up to 24 hours after delivery.  If you did not have an epidural, you may receive pain medicines directly into your veins through an intravenous line (IV) after surgery.  - This line runs through a pump that will be set to give you a certain amount of pain medicine.  - Often, you can push a button to give yourself more pain relief when you need it.  - This is called patient controlled analgesia (PCA).    You will then be switched to pain pills that you take by mouth, or you may receive shots of medicine. It is ok to ask for pain medicine when you need it. Do not be shy.

What Else? : You will have a urinary (Foley) catheter in place right after surgery, but this will be removed on the first day after surgery.  The area around your incision may be sore, numb, or both. Sutures or staples are usually removed around the second day, just before you leave the hospital.  At first you may be asked to only eat ice chips or take sips of water, at least until your health care provider is certain you are not likely to have very heavy bleeding. Most likely, you will be able to eat a light diet 8 hours after your C-section.)

ADAM_0000621_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Buying and Caring for Baby Bottles and Nipples
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000804.htm
Answer: Summary : Whether you feed your baby breast milk, infant formula, or both, you will need to buy bottles and nipples. You have many choices, so it can be hard to know what to buy. Learn about the different options and how to care for bottles and nipples.

How to Choose Bottles and Nipples : The type of nipple and bottle you choose will mainly depend on which type your baby will use. Some babies prefer a certain nipple shape, or they may have less gas with certain bottles. Others are less fussy. Start by buying a few different types of bottles and nipples. That way, you can try them out and see what works best for you and your baby.

Nipples : Nipples can be made from latex or silicone.  - Latex nipples are softer and more flexible. But some babies are sensitive to latex, and it does not last as long as silicone.  - Silicone nipples last longer and tend to hold their shape better.    Nipples come in different shapes.  - They can be dome-shaped, flat, or wide. Flat or wide nipples are shaped more like a mother's breast.  - Try different shapes to see which one your baby prefers.    Nipples come in different flow rates.  - You can get nipples that have a slow, medium, or fast flow rate. These nipples are often numbered, 1 is the slowest flow.  - Infants usually start with a smaller hole and slower flow. You will increase the size as your baby gets better at feeding and drinks more.  - Your baby should be able to get enough milk without having to suck too hard.  - If your baby is choking or spitting up, the flow is too fast.

Baby Bottles : Baby bottles come in different materials.  - Plastic bottles are lightweight and will not break if dropped. If you choose plastic, it is best to buy new bottles. Reused or hand-me-down bottles may contain bisphenol-A (BPA). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the use of BPA in baby bottles due to safety concerns.  - Glass bottles do not have BPA and are recyclable, but they can break if dropped. Some manufacturers sell plastic sleeves to prevent bottles from breaking.  - Stainless steel bottles are sturdy and will not break, but they may be more expensive.  - Disposable bottles have a plastic sleeve inside that you throw away after each use. The liner collapses as baby drinks, which helps prevent air bubbles. Liners save on cleanup, and are handy for traveling. But they add an extra cost, as you need a new liner for every feeding.    You can choose from several different bottle shapes and sizes:  - Standard bottles have straight or slightly rounded sides. They are easy to clean and fill, and you can easily tell how much milk is in the bottle.  - Angle-neck bottles are easier to hold. The milk collects at the end of the bottle. This helps prevent your baby from sucking in air. These bottles can be harder to fill and you need to hold them sideways or use a funnel.  - Wide bottles have a wide mouth and are short and squat. They are said to be more like a mother's breast, so they may be a good option for babies who go back and forth between breast and bottle.  - Vented bottles have a venting system inside to prevent air bubbles. They are said to help prevent colic and gas, but this is unproven. These bottles have a straw-like inner vent, so you will have more parts to keep track of, clean, and assemble.    When your baby is small, start with the smaller 4- to 5-ounce bottles. As your baby's appetite grows, you can switch to larger 8- to 9-ounce bottles.

Cleaning and Care : These tips can help you safely care for and clean baby bottles and nipples:  - When you first buy bottles and nipples, sterilize them. Place all of the parts in a pan covered with water and boil them for 5 minutes. Then wash with soap and warm water and air dry them.  - Clean bottles right after you use them so the milk doesn't dry and become caked onto the bottle. Wash bottles and other parts with soap and warm water. Use a bottle and nipple brush to get at hard-to-reach areas. ONLY use these brushes on baby bottles and parts. Dry bottles and nipples on a drying rack on the counter. Make sure everything is completely dry before using again.  - If bottles and nipples are labeled ""dishwasher safe,"" you can wash and dry them in the top rack of the dishwasher.  - Throw out cracked or torn nipples. Small pieces of the nipple can come off and cause choking.  - Throw out cracked or chipped bottles, which can pinch or cut you or your baby.  - Always wash your hands thoroughly before handling bottles and nipples.)

ADAM_0001276_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Drain opener poisoning (Also called: Drain opening agents)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002780.htm
Answer: Summary : Drain opening agents are chemicals used to open clogged drains, often in homes. Drain opening agent poisoning can occur if a child accidentally drinks these chemicals, or if someone splashes the poison into the eyes when pouring it or breathes in the fumes of ""foaming"" drain openers.  This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual poison exposure. If you have an exposure, you should call your local emergency number (such as 911) or the National Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.

Poisonous Ingredient : - Hydrochloric acid  - Lye (sodium hydroxide or caustic soda)  - Potassium hydroxide  - Sulfuric acid

Where Found : - Drain cleaners or openers   Note: This list may not include all sources of drain opening agents.

Symptoms : Blood:  - Severe change in acid level of blood (pH balance), which leads to damage in all of the body organs   Eyes, ears, nose, and throat   - Burns to the eyes, which may result in permanent vision loss  - Severe pain in the throat  - Severe pain or burning in the nose, eyes, ears, lips, or tongue   Gastrointestinal:  - Blood in the stool  - Burns and possible holes in thethroat (esophagus)  - Severe abdominal pain  - Vomiting  - Vomiting blood   Heart and circulatory system:  - Collapse  - Low blood pressure that develops rapidly   Lungs and airways:  - Breathing difficulty (from breathing in drain opening agent)  - Throat swelling (may also cause breathing difficulty)   Skin:  - Burns  - Holes (necrosis) in the skin or tissues underneath  - Irritation

Home Care : Seek immediate medical help. Do NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care professional.  If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.  If the chemical was swallowed, immediately give the person water or milk, unless instructed otherwise by a health care provider. Do NOT give water or milk if the patient is having symptoms (such as vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness) that make it hard to swallow.  If the person breathed in the poison, immediately move him or her to fresh air.

Before Calling Emergency : Determine the following information:  - Patient's age, weight, and condition  - Name of the product (ingredients and strengths, if known)  - Time it was swallowed  - Amount swallowed

Poison Control : The National Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) can be called from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  See: Poison control center - emergency number

What to Expect at the Emergency Room : The health care provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. You may receive:  - Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs, and breathing machine (ventilator)  - Bronchoscopy -- camera down the throat to see burns in the airways and lungs  - Chest x-ray  - EKG (heart tracing)  - Endoscopy -- camera down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and the stomach  - Fluids through the vein (by IV)  - Medicines for pain  - Surgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement)  - Washing of the skin (irrigation) -- perhaps every few hours for several days

Outlook (Prognosis) : How well you do depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster you get medical help, the better the chance for recovery.  If this type of poison gets in the eye, it can be very dangerous and difficult to manage. Loss of vision is common. Swallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body.  Damage continues to occur to the esophagus and stomach for several weeks after the poison was swallowed.)

ADAM_0001666_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Gallbladder removal - open (Also called: Cholecystectomy - open; Surgery - gallbladder - open)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002930.htm
Answer: Summary : Open gallbladder removal is surgery to remove the gallbladder through a large cut in your abdomen.

Description : Surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia so you will be asleep and pain-free. To perform the surgery:  - The surgeon makes a 5 to 7 inch cut in the upper right part of your belly, just below your ribs.  - The area is opened up so the surgeon can view the gallbladder and separate it from the other organs.  - The surgeon cuts the bile duct and blood vessels that lead to the gallbladder.  - The gallbladder is gently lifted out and removed from your body.    An x-ray called a cholangiogram may be done during your surgery.   - To do this test, dye is injected into your common bile duct and an x-ray is taken. The dye helps find stones that may be outside your gallbladder.  - If other stones are found, the surgeon may remove them with a special instrument.   The surgery takes about 1 hour.

Why the Procedure is Performed : You may need this surgery if you have pain or other symptoms from gallstones. You may also need surgery if your gallbladder is not working normally.  Common symptoms may include:  - Indigestion, including bloating, heartburn, and gas   - Nausea and vomiting  - Pain after eating, usually in the upper right or upper middle area of your belly (epigastric pain)    The most common way to remove the gallbladder is by using a medical instrument called a laparoscope (laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Open gallbladder surgery is used when laparoscopic surgery cannot be done safely. In some cases, the surgeon needs to switch to an open surgery if laparoscopic surgery cannot be successfully continued.  Other reasons for removing the gallbladder by open surgery:  - Unexpected bleeding during the laparoscopic operation  - Obesity  - Pancreatitis (inflammation in the pancreas)  - Pregnancy (third trimester)  - Severe liver problems  - Past surgeries in the same area of your belly

Risks : Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:  - Reactions to medicines  - Breathing problems  - Bleeding, blood clots  - Infection   Risks of gallbladder surgery are:  - Damage to the blood vessels that go to the liver  - Injury to the common bile duct  - Injury to the small or large intestine  - Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)

Before the Procedure : Your may have the following tests done before surgery:  - Blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney tests)  - Chest x-ray or electrocardiogram (EKG), for some patients  - Several x-rays of the gallbladder  - Ultrasound of the gallbladder    Tell your doctor or nurse:  - If you are or might be pregnant  - Which drugs, vitamins, and other supplements you are taking, even ones you bought without a prescription    During the week before surgery:  - You may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), vitamin E, warfarin (Coumadin), and any other drugs that may put you at a higher risk of bleeding during surgery.  - Ask your doctor which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery.  - Prepare your homefor any problems you might have getting around after the surgery.  - You'll be told when to arrive at the hospital.    On the day of surgery:  - Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.  - Take the drugs your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Shower the night before or the morning of your surgery.  - Arrive at the hospital on time.

After the Procedure : You may stay in the hospital for3 to5 days after open gallbladder removal. During that time:  - You may be asked to breathe into a device called an incentive spirometer. This helps keep your lungs working well so that you do not get pneumonia.  - The nurse will help you sit up in bed, hang your legs over the side, and then stand up and start to walk.  - At first, you will receive fluids into your vein through an intravenous(IV)tube. Soon after, you will be asked to start drinking liquids and eating foods.  - You will be able to shower while you are still in the hospital.  - You may be asked to wear pressure stockings on your legs to help prevent a blood clot from forming. These stockings also help keep your blood circulating well.    If there were problems during your surgery, or if you have bleeding, a lot of pain, or a fever, you may need to stay in the hospital longer. Your doctor or nurses will tell youhow to care for yourselfafter you leave the hospital.

Outlook (Prognosis) : Most people recover quickly and have good results from this procedure.)

ADAM_0002176_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Infant formulas - overview (Also called: Formula feeding; Bottle feeding)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002447.htm
Answer: Summary : During the first 4 to 6 months of life, infants need only breast milk or formula to meet all their nutritional needs. Infant formulas include powders, concentrated liquids, and ready-to-use forms.

Food Sources : There are different formulas available for infants younger than 12 months old who are not drinking breast milk. While there are some differences, infant formulas sold in the United States have all the nutrients babies need to grow and thrive.  TYPES OF FORMULAS  Babies need iron in their diet. It's best to use a formula fortified with iron, unless your child's doctor says not to.  Standard cow's milk-based formulas:  - Almost all babies do well on cow's milk-based formulas.  - These formulas are made with cow's milk protein that has been changed to be more like breast milk. They contain lactose (a type of sugar in milk) and minerals from the cow's milk.  - Vegetable oils, plus other minerals and vitamins are also in the formula.  - Fussiness and colic are common problems for all babies. Most of the time, cow's milk formulas are not the cause of these symptoms. This means that you likely do not need to switch to a different formula if your baby is fussy. If you're not sure, talk with your infant's doctor.    Soy-based formulas:  - These formulas are made using soy proteins. They do not contain lactose.  - The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) suggests using cow's milk-based formulas when possible rather than soy-based formulas.  - For parents who do not want their child to eat animal protein, the AAP recommends breastfeeding. Soy-based formulas are also an option.  - Soy-based formulas have NOT been proven to help with milk allergies or colic. Babies who are allergic to cow's milk may also be allergic to soy milk.  - Soy-based formulas should be used for infants with galactosemia, a rare condition. These formulas can also be used for babies who can't digest lactose, which is uncommon in children younger than 12 months.    Hypoallergenic formulas (protein hydrolysate formulas):  - This type of formula may be helpful for infants who have allergies to milk protein and for those with skin rashes or wheezing caused by allergies.  - Hypoallergenic formulas are generally much more expensive than regular formulas.    Lactose-free formulas:  - These formulas are also used for galactosemia and for children who can't digest lactose.  - A child who has an illness with diarrhea usually will not need lactose-free formula.    There are special formulas for babies with certain health problems. Your pediatrician will let you know if your baby needs a special formula. DO NOT give these unless your pediatrician recommends it.  - Reflux formulas are pre-thickened with rice starch. They are usually needed only for infants with reflux who are not gaining weight or who are very uncomfortable.  - Formulas for premature and low-birth-weight infants have extra calories and minerals to meet the needs of these infants.  - Special formulas may be used for infants with heart disease, malabsorption syndromes, and problems digesting fat or processing certain amino acids.    Newer formulas with no clear role:  - Toddler formulas are offered as added nutrition for toddlers who are picky eaters. To date, they have not been shown to be better than whole milk and multivitamins. They are also expensive.    Most formulas can be purchased in the following forms:  - Ready-to-use. Do not need to add water; convenient, but cost more.  - Concentrated liquid formulas. Need to be mixed with water, cost less.  - Powdered formulas. Must be mixed with water, cost the least.

Recommendations : The AAP recommends that all infants be fed breast milk or iron-fortified formula for at least 12 months.  Your baby will have a slightly different feeding pattern depending on whether she is breastfed or formula fed.  In general, breastfed babies tend to eat more often.   Formula-fed babies may need to eat about 6 to 8 times per day.  - Start newborns with 2 to 3 ounces of formula per feeding (for a total of 16 to 24 ounces per day).  - As with breastfeeding, the number of feedings will decrease as the baby gets older, but the amount of formula will increase to approximately 6 to 8 ounces per feeding.  - At 4 to 6 months of age, an infant should be consuming 28 to 45 ounces of formula and is often ready to start the transition to solid foods.   Infant formula can be used until a child is 1 year old. The AAP does not recommend regular cow's milk for children under 1 year old. After 1 year, the child should only get whole milk, not skim or reduced-fat milk.  Standard formulas contain 20 Kcal/ounce and 0.45 grams of protein/ounce. Formulas based on cow's milk are appropriate for most full-term and preterm infants.  Infants who drink enough formula and are gaining weight usually do not need extra vitamins or minerals. Your doctor or nurse may prescribe extra fluoride if the formula is being made with water that has not been fluorinated.)

This article focuses on lithium overdose, or toxicity.  - Acute toxicity occurs when you intentionally or accidentally swallow too much of a lithium prescription.  - Chronic toxicity occurs when you slowly take a little too much of a lithium prescription every day for a while. This is actually quite easy to do, as dehydration, other medications, and other conditions can easily interfere with lithium in your body and cause it to build up.  - Acute chronic toxicity occurs when you take lithium every day for bipolar disorder, but one day you take an extra amount (as little as a couple of pills or as much as a whole bottle).  - People taking lithium should have their blood levels monitored regularly. Some people can develop toxicity even when taking low dosages of lithium.   This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual poison exposure. If you have an exposure, you should call your local emergency number (such as 911) or the National Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.  See: Overdose)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002667.htm
Answer: ACUTE TOXICITY  After taking too much lithium you will have symptoms such as:  - Diarrhea  - Dizziness  - Nausea  - Stomach pains  - Vomiting  - Weakness    You may also have some of the following nervous system symptoms, depending on how much lithium you took:  - Coma (decreased level of consciousness, lack of responsiveness)  - Hand tremors  - Incoordination of arms and legs (ataxia)  - Muscle twitches  - Seizures  - Slurred speech  - Uncontrollable eye movement (nystagmus)    Heart problems may occur in rare cases.  CHRONIC TOXICITY  You will likely not have any gastrointestinal symptoms. Symptoms that may occur include:  - Increased reflexes  - Slurred speech  - Tremors    In severe cases, you may also have nervous system and kidney problems such as:  - Kidney failure  - Memory problems  - Movement disorders  - Problems keeping salts in your body  - Psychosis (thought disturbance, unpredictable behavior)   ACUTE ON CHRONIC TOXICITY  You will likely get some gastrointestinal symptoms and many of the severe nervous system symptoms listed above.)

Answer: The health care provider will measure and monitor the patient's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. You may receive:  - Activated charcoal, especially if other substances were also taken  - Blood tests to measure lithium levels and other body chemicals  - EKG (heart tracing)  - Fluids through a vein (by IV)  - Kidney dialysis (machine)  - Medicines to control symptoms  - Tube through the mouth into the stomach to remove some of the pills before they are absorbed by the stomach (gastric lavage) -- only if you recently swallowed a large amount of lithium)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002667.htm
Answer: If you have acute lithium toxicity, how well you do depends on how much lithium you took and how quickly you get help. Those who do not develop nervous system symptoms usually have no long-term complications.  If serious nervous system symptoms occur, you may have permanent neurologic problems.  Chronic toxicity is sometimes difficult to diagnose until late in the course. This delay can lead to long-term problems. If dialysis is performed quickly, you may feel much better, but symptoms such as memory and mood problems may be permanent.  Acute on chronic overdose often has the worst outlook. Nervous system symptoms may not go away even after many rounds of dialysis.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002950.htm
Answer: Summary : Open heart surgery is any surgery in which the chest is opened and surgery is done on the heart muscle, valves, arteries, or other parts of the heart (such as the aorta). The term ""open"" means that the chest is ""cut"" open.  The definition of open heart surgery has become less clear. New procedures are being done on the heart through smaller cuts. Some new procedures are being done while the heart is still beating.  Related topics include:  - Aortic valve surgery -- minimally invasive  - Aortic valve surgery -- open  - Atrial septal defect repair  - Cardiac transplant  - Coarctation of the aorta repair  - Congenital heart defect corrective surgery  - Heart bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft - CABG)  - Heart transplant  - Heart valve surgery  - Hypoplastic left heart repair  - Minimally invasive heart surgery (MIDCAB, OPCAB, RACAB)  - Mitral valve repair  - Mitral valve surgery -- minimally invasive  - Mitral valve surgery -- open  - Pediatric heart surgery  - Tetralogy of Fallot repair  - Total anomalous pulmonary venous return correction  - Transplant of the heart  - Transposition of great vessels repair  - Tricuspid atresia repair  - Truncus arteriosus repair  - Ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair

Description : A heart-lung machine is used in most cases during open heart surgery. While the surgeon works on the heart, the machine helps send oxygen-rich blood to the brain and other organs.  - Your heart surgeon will make a 5 to 8-inchsurgical cut in the chest wall. The breast bone is opened with a surgical saw to expose the heart. The surgeon can fix or replace a valve or perform bypass surgery.  - During endoscopic surgery, your surgeon makes one to four small holes in your chest. Then your surgeon uses special instruments and a camera to perform the surgery.  - During robot-assisted valve surgery, the surgeon makes two to four tiny cuts (about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch) in your chest. The surgeon uses a special computer to control robotic arms during the surgery. The surgeon sees a three-dimensional view of the surgery on the computer. This method is very precise. However, it has not been proven so far to have better results than traditional surgery methods.    You will not need to be on a heart-lung machine for some types of surgery using smaller cuts. However, your heart rate may be slowed with medicine or a mechanical device used to position the heart to do the operation. If there is a problem with these procedures, the surgeon may have to open the chest to do the surgery.)

ADAM_0002854_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Open lung biopsy (Also called: Biopsy - open lung)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003861.htm
Answer: Summary : An open lung biopsy is surgery to remove a small piece of tissue from the lung. The sample is then examined for cancer, infection, or lung disease.

How the Test is Performed : An open lung biopsy is done in the hospital using general anesthesia, which means you are asleep and pain-free. A tube will be placed through your mouth down your throat to help you breathe.  The surgery is done in the following way:  - After cleaning the skin, the surgeon makes a small cut in the left or right side of your chest.  - The ribs are gently separated.  - Tissue is taken from the lung and sent to a laboratory for examination.  - After surgery, the wound is closed with stitches.  - Your surgeon may leave a small plastic tube in your chest to prevent air and fluid from building up.

How to Prepare for the Test : You should tell the health care provider if you are pregnant, allergic to any medicines, or if you have a bleeding problem. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take, including herbs, supplements, and those bought without a prescription.   Follow your surgeon's instructions for not eating or drinking before the procedure.

How the Test will Feel : When you wake up after the procedure, you will feel drowsy for several hours.   There will be some tenderness and pain where the surgical cut is located. Most surgeons inject a long-acting local anesthetic at the surgical cut site so that you will have very little pain afterwards.  You may have a sore throat from the tube. You can ease the pain by eating ice chips.

Why the Test is Performed : The open lung biopsy is done to evaluate lung problems seen on x-ray or CT scan.

Normal Results : The lungs and lung tissue will be normal.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may be due to:  - Benign tumors  - Cancer  - Certain infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal)  - Lung diseases (fibrosis)    The procedure may help diagnose a number of different conditions, such as:  - Rheumatoid lung disease  - Sarcoidosis  - Wegener granulomatosis

Risks : There is a possibility of infection or an air leak into the chest. Your risk depends on whether or not you already have lung disease.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003863.htm
Answer: Summary : An open pleural biopsy is a procedure to remove and examine the tissue that lines the inside of the chest. This tissue is called the pleura.

How the Test is Performed : An open pleural biopsy is done in the hospital using general anesthesia, which means you are asleep and pain-free. A tube will be placed through your mouth down your throat to help you breathe.  The surgery is done in the following way:  - After cleaning the skin, the surgeon makes a small cut in the left or right side of the chest.  - The ribs are gently separated.   - Tissue is taken from inside the chest and sent to a laboratory for examination.  - After surgery, the wound is closed with stitches.  - Your surgeon may decide to leave a small plastic tube in your chest to prevent air and fluid from building up

How to Prepare for the Test : You should tell the health care provider if you are pregnant, allergic to any medicines, or if you have a bleeding problem. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take, including herbs, supplements, and those bought without a prescription.   Follow your surgeon's instructions for not eating or drinking before the procedure.

How the Test will Feel : When you wake up after the procedure, you will feel drowsy for several hours.   There will be some tenderness and pain where the surgical cut is located. Most surgeons inject a long-acting local anesthetic at the surgical cut site so that you will have very little pain afterwards.  You may have a sore throat from the breathing tube. You can ease the pain by eating ice chips.

Why the Test is Performed : This procedure is used when the surgeon needs a larger piece of tissue than can be removed with a pleural needle biopsy. The test is most often done to rule out mesothelioma.  It is also done when there is fluid in the chest cavity, or when a direct view of the pleura and the lungs is needed.  This procedure may also be done to examine a metastatic pleural tumor.

Normal Results : The pleura will be normal.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal findings may be due to:  - Abnormal tissue growth (neoplasms)  - Disease due to a virus, fungus, or parasite  - Mesothelioma  - Tuberculosis

Risks : There is a slight chance of:  - Air leak  - Excess blood loss  - Infection  - Injury to the lung  - Pneumothorax)

Answer: To prevent tooth decay, consider breastfeeding your baby. Breast milk by itself is the best food for your baby. It keeps the inside of your baby's mouth healthy and prevents tooth decay.  If you are bottle-feeding your baby:  - Give babies, ages newborn to 12 months, only formula to drink in bottles.  - Remove the bottle from your child's mouth or hands when your child falls asleep.  - Put your child to bed with a bottle of water only. Do not put your baby to bed with a bottle of juice, milk, or other sweet drinks.  - Teach your baby to drink from a cup at 6 months of age. Stop using a bottle for your babies when they are 12 to 14 months old.  - Do not fill your child's bottle with drinks that are high in sugar, such as punch or soft drinks.  - Do not let your child walk around with a bottle of juice or milk.  - Do not let your baby suck on a pacifier all the time.

Overall, vegetables fresh from the farm or just picked are healthier than frozen or canned ones. But frozen and canned vegetables can still be a good choice. They need to be canned or frozen right after being harvested, when they still have all of their healthy nutrients.  Also, keep in mind how much salt is added to canned vegetables. Try to buy those without added salt and don't overcook any vegetable, whether fresh, frozen, or canned. Instead of boiling them in water for longer periods of time, they should be lightly steamed.)

ADAM_0002354_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Learn about gluten-free diets
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000813.htm
Answer: Summary : On a gluten-free diet, you do not eat wheat, rye, and barley. These foods contain gluten, a type of protein. A gluten-free diet is the main treatment for celiac disease. Some people believe a gluten-free diet can also help improve other health problems, but there is little research to support this idea.

Reasons to Avoid Gluten : People follow a gluten-free diet for a number of reasons:  Celiac disease. People with this condition cannot eat gluten because it triggers an immune response that damages the lining of their stomach. This response causes inflammation in the small intestine and makes it hard for the body to absorb nutrients in food. Symptoms include bloating, constipation, and diarrhea.  Gluten sensitivity. People with gluten sensitivity do not have celiac disease. Eating gluten causes many of the same symptoms as in celiac disease, without the stomach damage.  Gluten intolerance. This describes people who have symptoms and may or may not have celiac disease. Symptoms include cramping, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea.  If you have one of these conditions, a gluten-free diet will help control your symptoms. It also helps prevent health problems in people with celiac disease.  Other health claims. Some people go gluten-free because they believe it can help control health problems such as headaches, depression, chronic fatigue, and weight gain. However, these claims are unproven.  Because you cut out a whole group of foods, a gluten-free diet can cause you to lose weight. However, there are easier diets to follow for weight loss. People with celiac disease often gain weight because their symptoms improve.

How it Works : On this diet, you need to learn which foods contain gluten and avoid them. This is not easy, because gluten is in many foods and food products.   Many foods are naturally gluten-free, including:  - Fruits and vegetables  - Meat, fish, poultry, and eggs  - Beans  - Nuts and seeds  - Dairy products    Other grains and starches are fine to eat, as long as they do not come boxed with seasonings:  - Quinoa  - Amaranth  - Buckwheat  - Cornmeal  - Millet  - Rice    You can also buy gluten-free versions of foods such as bread, flour, crackers, and cereals. These products are made with rice and other gluten-free flours. Keep in mind that they are often higher in sugar and calories and lower in fiber than the foods they replace.

Off-Limit Foods : When following this diet, you must avoid foods that contain gluten:  - Wheat  - Barley (this includes malt, malt flavoring, and malt vinegar)  - Rye  - Triticale (a grain that is a cross between wheat and rye)    You must also avoid these foods, which contain wheat:  - Bulgur  - Couscous  - Durum flour  - Farina  - Graham flour  - Kamut  - Semolina  - Spelt    Note that ""wheat-free"" does not always mean gluten-free. Many foods contain gluten or traces of wheat. Read the label and only buy ""gluten-free"" options of:  - Bread and other baked goods  - Pastas  - Cereals  - Crackers  - Beer  - Soy sauce  - Seitan  - Breading  - Battered or deep-fried foods  - Oats  - Processed foods, including frozen foods, soups, and rice mixes  - Salad dressings, sauces, marinades, and gravies  - Some candies, licorice  - Some medicines and vitamins (gluten is used to bind the pill ingredients together)

The Role of Exercise : A gluten-free diet is a way of eating, so exercise is not included as part of the plan. However, you should exercise for at least 30 minutes a day on most days for good health.

Health Benefits : People with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet to prevent damage to their intestines.  Avoiding gluten will not improve your heart health if you do not eat healthy foods. Be sure to substitute plenty of whole grains, fruit, and vegetables in place of gluten.

Possible Health Concerns : Many foods made with wheat flour are fortified with vitamins and minerals. Cutting out wheat and other grains can leave you short of nutrients like these:  - Calcium  - Fiber  - Folate  - Iron  - Niacin  - Riboflavin  - Thiamin   To get all the vitamins and minerals you need, eat a variety of healthy foods. Working with your health care provider or a dietitian can also help ensure you get proper nutrition.

Ease of Use : Because so many foods contain gluten, this can be a hard diet to follow. It can feel limiting when you shop or eat out. However, as the diet has become more popular, gluten-free foods have become available in more stores. Also, many restaurants are now offering gluten-free meals.

Where to Find More Information : The National Institutes of Health has a Celiac Awareness Campaignat celiac.nih.gov with information and resources.  You can find information on celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and gluten-free cooking from these organizations:  - Beyond Celiac - www.beyondceliac.org  - The Celiac Disease Foundation - celiac.org   There are also a number of books on gluten-free eating. Your best bet is to find one written by a dietitian.

When to Call Your Doctor : If you think you may have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, talk with your doctor. You should be tested for celiac disease, which is a serious condition.  If you have symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance, DO NOT stop eating gluten without first getting tested for celiac disease. You may have a different health condition that a gluten-free diet cannot treat. Also, following a gluten-free diet for several months or years may make it more difficult to accurately diagnose celiac disease. If you stop eating gluten before being tested, it will affect the results.)

ADAM_0002355_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Learn to love exercise
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000764.htm
Answer: Summary : You know exercise is good for you. It can help you lose weight, relieve stress, and boost your mood. You also know it helps prevent heart disease and other health problems. But despite knowing these facts, you may still struggle to get regular exercise.  Improve your perception of exercise -- don't see it as just something you should do, but as something you want to do. Tailor your exercise routine, so it becomes something you actually look forward to doing.

Do activities you enjoy : With so many options for exercise, there's no need to suffer through a workout you don't like.  - Be true to yourself. Look for activities that suit your personality. If you're a social butterfly, try group activities, such as dance classes, a cycling club, or a walking group. Many groups welcome new members at all levels. If competition is what drives you, take up softball or join a rowing club. If you prefer solo exercise, consider jogging or swimming.  - Try something new. There's a whole world of exercise possibilities out there, from salsa classes, to kayaking, to rock climbing. You never know what activities you might enjoy until you try them. So see what's available in your area and go for it. Whether it's horseback riding, belly dancing, or water polo, find an activity or sport that interests you and sign-up. If you find it hard to go alone, bring a friend or family member.  - Channel your inner child. Think about activities you enjoyed as a child, and try them again. Was it roller skating, dance, maybe basketball? You may be surprised at how much you still enjoy your childhood pastimes. Many communities have adult leagues and classes you can join.  - Choose your sweet spot. Do you love being outdoors? Choose activities that get you outside, such as walking, hiking, or gardening. If you prefer to exercise indoors, think about swimming, active video games, or yoga.  - Mix it up. Even the most fun activity can get boring if you do it day after day. Find a few things you like and mix it up. For example, you might play golf on a Saturdays, take tango classes on Mondays, and swim laps on Wednesdays.  - Add a soundtrack. Listening to music helps the time pass and keeps your pace up. Or you might try listening to audio books while you walk or ride a stationary bike. Just be sure the volume is low enough for you to hear what is going on around you.

Stay motivated : Getting started with a routine is just the first step. You will also need help staying motivated so that you keep up your new habits.  - Remind yourself how much you like exercising. Most people feel really good after exercising. But for some reason, it's hard to remember that feeling before your next workout. As a reminder, make a few notes about how good you feel after a workout. Or take a photo of yourself after a workout and stick it on the fridge for inspiration.  - Share your progress online. Social media offers a number of ways to share your progress and get positive feedback from friends. Look for websites where you can track your daily walk or run. If you like to write, start a blog about your adventures.  - Sign up for a charity event. Charity events offer you the chance to walk, ski, run, or bike for a good cause. Not only are these events fun, but training for them can help keep your motivation up. Many charities help participants by arranging training runs or bikes. You'll get fit while meeting new friends. Or, boost your motivation by signing up for the event with family, friends, or coworkers.  - Reward yourself. Treat yourself for hitting your goals. Think about rewards that support your efforts, such as new walking shoes, a heart rate monitor, or a GPS watch you can use to track your workouts. Small rewards work as well, such as tickets to a concert or movie.)

ADAM_0002356_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Learn to manage stress ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001942.htm
Answer: We all feel stress at one time or another. It's a normal and healthy reaction to change or a challenge. But stress that goes on for more than a few weeks can affect your health. Keep stress from making you sick by learning healthy ways to manage it.  LEARN TO RECOGNIZE STRESS  The first step in managing stress is recognizing it in your life. Everyone feels stress in a different way. You may get angry or irritable, lose sleep, or have headaches or stomach upset. What are your signs of stress? Once you know what signals to look for, you can start to manage it.  Also identify the situations that cause you stress. These are called stressors. Your stressors could be family, work, relationships, money, or health problems. Once you understand where your stress is coming from, you can come up with ways to deal with your stressors.  AVOID UNHEALTHY STRESS RELIEF  When you feel stressed, you may fall back on unhealthy behaviors to help you relax. These may include:  - Eating too much  - Smoking cigarettes  - Drinking alcohol or using drugs  - Sleeping too much or not sleeping enough    These behaviors may help you feel better at first, but they may hurt you more than they help. Instead, use the tips below to find healthy ways to reduce your stress.  FIND HEALTHY STRESS BUSTERS  There are many healthy ways to manage stress. Try a few and see which ones work best for you.  - Recognize the things you can't change. Accepting that you can't change certain things allows you to let go and not get upset. For instance, you cannot change the fact that you have to drive during rush hour. But you can look for ways to relax during your commute, such as listening to a podcast or book.  - Avoid stressful situations. When you can, remove yourself from the source of stress. For example, if your family squabbles during the holidays, give yourself a breather and go out for a walk or drive.  - Get exercise. Getting physical activity every day is one of the easiest -- and best -- ways to cope with stress. When you exercise, your brain releases chemicals that make you feel good. It can also help you release built-up energy or frustration. Find something you enjoy -- whether it is walking, cycling, softball, swimming, or dancing -- and do it for at least 30 minutes on most days.  - Change your outlook. Try to develop a more positive attitude toward challenges. You can do this by replacing negative thoughts with more positive ones. For example, rather than thinking, ""Why does everything always go wrong?"" change this thought to, ""I can find a way to get through this."" It may seem hard or silly at first, but with practice you may find it helps turn your outlook around.  - Do something you enjoy. When stress has you down, do something you enjoy to help pick you up. It could be as simple as reading a good book, listening to music, watching a favorite movie, or having dinner with a friend. Or, take up a new hobby or class. Whatever you choose, try to do at least one thing a day that's just for you.  - Learn new ways to relax. Practicing relaxation techniques is a great way to handle daily stress. Relaxation techniques help slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure. There are many types, from deep breathing and meditation to yoga and tai chi. Take a class, or try learning from books, videos, or online sources.  - Connect with loved ones. Do not let stress get in the way of being social. Spending time with family and friends can help you feel better and forget about your stress. Confiding in a friend may also help you work out your problems.  - Get enough sleep. Getting a good night's sleep can help you think more clearly and have more energy. This will make it easier to handle any problems that crop up. Aim for about 7 to 9 hours each night.  - Eat a healthy diet. Eating healthy foods helps fuel your body and mind. Skip the high-sugar snack foods and load up on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat or nonfat dairy, and lean proteins.  - Learn to say no. If your stress comes from taking on too much at home or work, learn to set limits. Ask others for help when you need it.    RESOURCES  If you can't manage stress on your own, you may want to talk with your health care provider. Or consider seeing a therapist or counselor who can help you find other ways to deal with your stress. Depending on the cause of your stress, you also may find it helps to join a support group.)

ADAM_0002357_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Learn to manage your anger
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000858.htm
Answer: Summary : Anger is a normal emotion that everyone feels from time to time. But when you feel anger too intensely or too often, it can become a problem. Anger can put a strain on your relationships or cause problems at school or work.   Anger management can help you learn healthy ways to express and control your anger.

Understanding Anger : Anger can be triggered by feelings, people, events, situations, or memories. You may feel anger when you worry about conflicts at home. A bossy coworker or commuter traffic may make your angry.   When you feel anger, your blood pressure and heart rate go up. Certain hormone levels increase, causing a burst of energy. This allows us to react aggressively when we feel threatened.   There are always going to be things in life that make you angry. The problem is that lashing out is not a good way to react most of the time. You have little or no control over the things that cause your anger. But can you learn to control your reaction.

Who Needs Anger Management : Some people seem to be more prone to anger. Others may have grown up in a household full of anger and threats. Excess anger causes problems both for you and the people around you. Being angry all the time pushes people away. It can also be bad for your heart and cause stomach problems, trouble sleeping, and headaches.  You may need help controlling your anger if you:  - Often get into arguments that spin out of control  - Become violent or break things when angry  - Threaten others when you are angry  - Have been arrested or jailed because of your anger

How Anger Management Works : Anger management teaches you how to express your anger in a healthy way. You can learn to express your feelings and needs while respecting others.  Here are some ways to manage your anger. You can try one or combine a few:  - Pay attention to what triggers your anger. You may need to do this after you calm down. Knowing when you may get angry can help you plan ahead to manage your reaction.  - Change your thinking. Angry people often see things in terms of ""always"" or ""never."" For example, you may think ""you never support me"" or ""things always go wrong for me."" The fact is, this is rarely true. These statements can make you feel that there is no solution. This only fuels your anger. Try to avoid using these words. This can help you see things more clearly. It may take a little practice at first, but it will get easier the more you do it.  - Find ways to relax. Learning to relax your body and mind can help you calm down. There are many different relaxation techniques to try. You can learn them from classes, books, DVDs, and online. Once you find a technique that works for you, you can use it whenever you start to feel angry.  - Take a time out. Sometimes the best way to calm your anger is to get away from the situation that is causing it. If you feel like you are about to blow up, take a few minutes alone to cool off. Tell family, friends, or trusted coworkers about this strategy ahead of time. Let them know you will need a few minutes to calm down and will return when you have cooled off.  - Work to solve problems. If the same situation makes you feel angry over and over, look for a solution. For example, if you get angry every morning sitting in traffic, look for a different route or leave at a different time. You could also try public transportation, riding your bike to work, or listening to a book or calming music.  - Learn to communicate. If you find yourself ready to fly off the handle, take a moment to slow down. Try to listen to the other person without jumping to conclusions. DO NOT respond with the first thing that pops into your mind. You may regret it later. Instead, take a moment to think about your answer.

For More Help : If you need more help dealing with your anger, look for a class on anger management or talk with a counselor who specializes in this topic. Ask your health care provider for suggestions and referrals.

When to Call Your Doctor : You should call your health care provider:  - If you feel like your anger is out of control  - If your anger is affecting your relationships or work  - You are concerned you might hurt yourself or others)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000325.htm
Answer: Depression is feeling sad, blue, unhappy, or down in the dumps. Most people feel this way once in a while.  Clinical depression is a mood disorder. It occurs when feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration get in the way of your life over a long period of time. It also changes how your body works.  Depression is caused by changes in the chemicals in your brain. The condition may start during or after a painful event in your life. It may happen when you take certain medicines. It can also start during or after pregnancy.  Sometimes there is no clear trigger or reason.)

ADAM_0002359_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Learning about ventilators
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000458.htm
Answer: Summary : A ventilator is a machine that breathes for you or helps you breathe. It is also called a breathing machine or respirator. The ventilator:   - Is attached to a computer with knobs and buttons that are controlled by a respiratory therapist, nurse, or doctor.  - Has tubes that connect to the person through a breathing tube. The breathing tube is placed in the person's mouth or in an opening through the neck into the windpipe (trachea). This opening is called a tracheostomy.  - Makes noise and has alarms that alert the health care team when something needs to be fixed or changed.

How Does Being on a Ventilator Feel? : A person receives medicine to remain comfortable while on a ventilator, especially if they have a breathing tube in their mouth. The medicine may cause people to be too sleepy to open their eyes.  People cannot talk because of the breathing tube. When they are awake enough to open their eyes and move, they can communicate in writing.  People on ventilators will have many wires and tubes on them. This may look scary, but these wires and tubes help to carefully monitor them.  Some people may have restraints. These are used to prevent them from pulling out any important tubes and wires.

Why are Ventilators Needed? : People are placed on ventilators when they cannot breathe on their own. This may be for any of the following reasons:  - To make sure the person is getting enough oxygen and is getting rid of carbon dioxide.  - After surgery, people may need a ventilator to breathe for them when they have had medicine that causes them to be sleepy and their breathing has not returned to normal.  - A person has an illness or injury and is not able to breathe normally.   Most of the time, a ventilator is needed only for a short time -- hours, days, or weeks. But in some cases, a ventilator is needed for months, or sometimes years.

What Kind of Care Does a Person Need When on a Ventilator? : In the hospital, a person on a ventilator is watched closely by health care providers including doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists.  People who need ventilators for long periods may stay in long-term care facilities. Some people with a tracheostomy may be able to be at home.  Patients on a ventilator are watched carefully for lung infections. When connected to a ventilator, a person has a hard time coughing out mucus. If mucus collects, the lungs do not get enough oxygen. The mucus can also lead to pneumonia. To get rid of the mucus, a procedure called suctioning is needed. This is done by inserting a small thin tube into the person's mouth or neck opening to vacuum out the mucus.  When the ventilator is used for more than a few days, the person may receive nutrition through tubes into either a vein or their stomach.  Because the person cannot speak, special efforts need to be made to monitor them and provide them with other ways to communicate.)

ADAM_0002852_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Online health information - what can you trust?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000869.htm
Answer: Summary : When you have a question about your or your family's health, you may look it up on the Internet. You can find accurate health information on many sites. But, you are also likely to run across a lot of questionable, even false content. How can you tell the difference?  To find health information you can trust, you have to know where and how to look. These tips can help.

What to Look For : With a bit of detective work, you can find information you can trust.  - Search for websites of well-known health institutions. Medical schools, professional health organizations, and hospitals often provide online health content.  - Look for "".gov,"" "".edu,"" or "".org"" in the web address. A "".gov"" address means the site is run by a government agency. A "".edu"" address indicates an educational institution. And a "".org"" address often means a professional organization runs the site. A "".com"" address means a for-profit company runs the site. It may still have some good information, but the content may be biased.  - Find out who wrote or reviewed the content. Look for health care providers such as doctors (MDs), nurses (RNs), or other licensed health professionals. Also look for an editorial policy. This policy can tell you where the site gets its content or how it is created.  - Look for scientific references. Content is more reliable if it is based on scientific studies. Professional journals are good references. These include the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and the New England Journal of Medicine. Recent editions of medical textbooks are also good references.  - Look for the contact information on the site. You should be able to reach the site sponsor by telephone, email, or a mailing address.  - No matter where you find the information, check how old the content is. Even trusted sites may have out-of-date information archived. Look for content that is no more than 2 to 3 years old. Individual pages may have a date at the bottom that says when it was last updated. Or the home page may have such a date.  - Beware of chat rooms and discussion groups. The content in these forums is typically not reviewed or regulated. Plus it may come from people who are not experts, or who are trying to sell something.  - DO NOT rely on just one website. Compare the information you find on a site with content from other sites. Make sure other sites can back up the information you have found.

Things to Keep in Mind : While searching for health information online, use common sense and be wary.  - If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Beware of quick-fix cures. And remember that a money-back guarantee does not mean that something works.  - As with any kind of website, it is important to be careful with your personal information. DO NOT give out your Social Security number. Before you buy anything, be sure that the site has a secure server. This will help protect your credit card information. You can tell by looking in the box near the top of the screen that cites the web address. At the start of the web address, look for ""https"".  - Personal stories are not scientific fact. Just because someone claims that their personal health story is true, it does not mean that it is. But even if it is true, the same treatment may not apply to your case. Only your health care provider can help you find the care that is best for you.

Where to Start : Here are a few high-quality resources to get you started.  - American Heart.org -- www.americanheart.org: Information on heart disease and ways to prevent disease. From the American Heart Association.  - Diabetes.org -- www.diabetes.org: Information on diabetes and ways to prevent, manage, and treat the disease. From the American Diabetes Association.  - Familydoctor.org -- familydoctor.org: General health information for families. Produced by the American Academy of Family Physicians.  - Healthfinder.gov -- www.healthfinder.gov: General health information.

Produced by the National Library of Medicine as part of the National Institutes of Health.  - NIHSeniorHealth.gov -- www.nihseniorhealth.gov: Health information for older adults. From the National Institutes of Health.

When to Call the Doctor : It is great that you are seeking information to help you manage your health. But keep in mind that online health information can never replace a talk with your health care provider. Talk to your provider if you have questions about your health, your treatment, or anything you read online. It can be helpful to print out the articles you have read and bring them with you to your appointment.)

CDC_0000054_Sec7.txt,"Question: how can botulism be prevented?
URL: http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/botulism/
Answer: Many cases of botulism are preventable. Foodborne botulism has often been from home-canned foods with low acid content, such as asparagus, green beans, beets and corn and is caused by failure to follow proper canning methods. However, seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade, with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture, at retail, or by consumers; some examples are chopped garlic in oil, canned cheese sauce, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice, and baked potatoes wrapped in foil. In Alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods. Persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods, and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners/cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the US Department of Agriculture. Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs. Most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust.  The bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.  Honey can contain the bacteria that causes infant botulism so, children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey. Honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and older.)

CDC_0000212_Sec3.txt,"Question: how can hps be prevented for Hantavirus ?
URL: http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/
Answer: Eliminate or minimize contact with rodents in your home, workplace, or campsite. If rodents don't find that where you are is a good place for them to be, then you're less likely to come into contact with them. Seal up holes and gaps in your home or garage. Place traps in and around your home to decrease rodent infestation. Clean up any easy-to-get food.
  
Recent research results show that many people who became ill with HPS developed the disease after having been in frequent contact with rodents and/or their droppings around a home or a workplace. On the other hand, many people who became ill reported that they had not seen rodents or rodent droppings at all. Therefore, if you live in an area where the carrier rodents are known to live, try to keep your home, vacation place, workplace, or campsite clean.

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome
Answer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.  The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities.  Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor and a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood.  Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.)

GHR_0000113_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ? (Also called: BWS; Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS))
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome
Answer: The genetic causes of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are complex. The condition usually results from the abnormal regulation of genes in a particular region of chromosome 11. People normally inherit one copy of this chromosome from each parent. For most genes on chromosome 11, both copies of the gene are expressed, or ""turned on,"" in cells. For some genes, however, only the copy inherited from a person's father (the paternally inherited copy) is expressed. For other genes, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternally inherited copy) is expressed. These parent-specific differences in gene expression are caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. Abnormalities involving genes on chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting are responsible for most cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  At least half of all cases result from changes in a process called methylation. Methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of DNA. In genes that undergo genomic imprinting, methylation is one way that a gene's parent of origin is marked during the formation of egg and sperm cells. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is often associated with changes in regions of DNA on chromosome 11 called imprinting centers (ICs). ICs control the methylation of several genes that are involved in normal growth, including the CDKN1C, H19, IGF2, and KCNQ1OT1 genes. Abnormal methylation disrupts the regulation of these genes, which leads to overgrowth and the other characteristic features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  About twenty percent of cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are caused by a genetic change known as paternal uniparental disomy (UPD). Paternal UPD causes people to have two active copies of paternally inherited genes rather than one active copy from the father and one inactive copy from the mother. People with paternal UPD are also missing genes that are active only on the maternally inherited copy of the chromosome. In Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, paternal UPD usually occurs early in embryonic development and affects only some of the body's cells. This phenomenon is called mosaicism. Mosaic paternal UPD leads to an imbalance in active paternal and maternal genes on chromosome 11, which underlies the signs and symptoms of the disorder.  Less commonly, mutations in the CDKN1C gene cause Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control growth before birth. Mutations in the CDKN1C gene prevent this protein from restraining growth, which leads to the abnormalities characteristic of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  About 1 percent of all people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have a chromosomal abnormality such as a rearrangement (translocation), abnormal copying (duplication), or loss (deletion) of genetic material from chromosome 11. Like the other genetic changes responsible for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, these abnormalities disrupt the normal regulation of certain genes on this chromosome.)

GHR_0000113_Sec4.txt,"Question: Is Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome inherited ? (Also called: BWS; Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS))
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome
Answer: In about 85 percent of cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, only one person in a family has been diagnosed with the condition. However, parents of one child with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome may be at risk of having other children with the disorder. This risk depends on the genetic cause of the condition.  Another 10 to 15 percent of people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are part of families with more than one affected family member. In most of these families, the condition appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of an altered gene in each cell is typically sufficient to cause the disorder. In most of these cases, individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome inherit the genetic change from their mothers. Occasionally, a person who inherits the altered gene will not have any of the characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition.  Rarely, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome results from changes in the structure of chromosome 11. Some of these chromosomal abnormalities are inherited from a parent, while others occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in the earliest stages of development before birth.)

ADAM_0000817_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Cholesterol - drug treatment
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000314.htm
Answer: Summary : Your body needs cholesterol to work properly. But extra cholesterol in your blood causes deposits to build up on the inside walls of your blood vessels. This buildup is called plaque. It narrows your arteries and reduces or stops blood flow. This can lead to heart attack, stroke, or narrowed arteries elsewhere in your body.    Statins are thought to be the best drugs to use for people who need medicines to lower their cholesterol.

Statins for Cholesterol : Statins reduce your risk of heart disease, stroke, and other related problems. They do this by lowering your LDL (bad) cholesterol.  Most of the time you will need to take this medicine for the rest of your life. In some cases, changing your lifestyle and losing extra weight may allow you to stop taking this medicine.

Who Should Take Statins to Lower Cholesterol? : Having low LDL and total cholesterol reduces your risk of heart disease. But not everyone needs to take statins to lower cholesterol.  Your doctor will decide on your treatment based on:  - Your total, HDL (good), and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels  - Your age  - Your history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease  - Other health problems that may be caused by high cholesterol  - Whether or not you smoke  - Your risk of heart disease  - Your ethnicity    You should take statins if you are 75 or younger, and you have a history of:  - Heart problems due to narrowed arteries in the heart  - Stroke or TIA (mini stroke)  - Aortic aneurysm (a bulge in the main artery in your body)  - Narrowing of the arteries to your legs    If you are older than 75, your doctor may prescribe a lower dose of a statin. This may help lessen possible side effects.  You should take statins if your LDL cholesterol is 190 mg/dL or higher. You should also take statins if your LDL cholesterol is between 70 and 189 mg/dL and:  - You have diabetes and are between ages 40 and 75  - You have diabetes and a high risk of heart disease  - You have a high risk of heart disease    You and your doctor may want to consider statins if your LDL cholesterol is 70 to 189 mg/dL and:  - You have diabetes and a medium risk for heart disease  - You have a medium risk for heart disease

How low Should Your LDL Cholesterol be? : Doctors used to set a target level for your LDL cholesterol. But now the focus is reducing your risk for problems caused by narrowing of your arteries. Your doctor may monitor your cholesterol levels. But frequent testing is rarely needed.  Adding other drugs along with statins provides little to no benefit in most cases.  You and your doctor will decide what dose of a statin you should take. If you have risk factors, your doctor may prescribe higher doses. Factors that your doctor will consider when choosing the dose include:  - Your total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels before treatment  - Whether you have coronary artery disease (history of angina or heart attack), a history of stroke, or narrowed arteries in your legs  - Whether you have diabetes  - Whether you smoke or have high blood pressure    Higher doses may lead to side effects over time. So your doctor will also consider your age and risk factors for side effects.)

ADAM_0000824_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Choosing the best doctor
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002069.htm
Answer: Summary : When it is time to find a new doctor, you want to choose someone you can trust. How can you find out the truth about your doctor? While many doctors are caring, professional, and competent, some are not. Fortunately, there are ways to check a doctor's credentials and standing. Use the resources below to learn about your doctor before you start working together. Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB)  The FSMB has a list of state medical board websites -- www.fsmb.org/pdf/GRPOL_Physician_Profiling.pdf. You can look up your doctor on the state site to see if he or she is licensed to practice in your state. Not all states provide the same amount of information. Some only share state license and board actions against the doctor. Others include actions taken in other states, medical malpractice, disciplinary actions, awards, and more. If your state doesn't provide this information, you may be able to request it.  Other health care providers, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants are also licensed by states. Most states have a similar search for all licensed medical providers.  For a more complete picture, you can order a doctor profile from the FSMB -- www.docinfo.org for $9.95. The FSMB collects data on doctors, osteopaths, and most physician assistants who are licensed to practice in the U.S. The profile includes:  - Physician disciplinary sanctions  - Education: medical school name, year of graduation, and degree earned  - Medical specialty  - Location information   HealthGrades  HealthGrades -- www.healthgrades.com gathers data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and state medical boards. You can use this free website to get information about your doctor, as well as about local hospitals. You can get information on a doctor's:  - Experience  - Education and training  - Procedures performed  - Conditions treated  - Malpractice claims, sanctions, and board actions  - Awards  - Languages spoken    The site also collects patient satisfaction surveys from site users. NCQA Recognition Directory  The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) -- recognition.ncqa.org is a not-for-profit organization committed to improving health care quality. You can search their database of doctors to see who in your area participates in NCQA recognition programs. Participation means that the doctor is focused on providing quality care and follows the latest patient care methods. Prescriber Checkup and Dollars for Doctors  These pages are run by ProPublica, a nonprofit news organization. ProPublica produces investigative journalism in the public interest. Using Dollars for Doctors -- www.propublica.org/series/dollars-for-docs, you can check to see whether your doctor has received money from a drug company. With Prescriber Checkup -- projects.propublica.org/checkup, you can view your doctor's prescribing habits compared to the average doctor. These sites use prescribing data from Medicare Part D. This means that most of the information is based on prescriptions written for older adults and people with disabilities. These groups tend to use more prescription drugs. Some Things to Keep in Mind  While these sites can help you find out about your doctor, they are not foolproof. Most of the information you will find is from lawsuits that have been settled. If any complaints are still in process, you won't see them. Keep in mind that doctors in certain specialties may be more likely to be sued. And not all lawsuits mean that the doctor did something wrong.  Your health care provider may be a nurse practitioner or physician assistant. There are different sites to check on certification and specialization for these providers.  Use care when reviewing patient satisfaction scores. You are more likely to see telltale trends if a health care provider has been reviewed by 40 people rather than 4. Read the results closely. Poor scores for this office don't necessarily reflect on the health care provider, who may be one of many providers in a busy practice.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000016.htm
Answer: Many street drugs have no therapeutic benefits. Any use of these drugs is a form of drug abuse.  Legitimate medications can be abused by people who take more than the recommended dose or who intentionally take them with alcohol or other drugs.  Drug interactions may also produce adverse effects. Therefore, it is important to let your doctor know about all the drugs you are taking, including vitamins and other over-the-counter medications.  Many drugs are addictive. Sometimes the addiction is gradual. However, some drugs (such as cocaine) can cause addiction after only a few doses.  Someone who has become addicted to a drug usually will have withdrawal symptoms when the drug is suddenly stopped. Withdrawal is greatly assisted by professional help.  A drug dose that is large enough to be toxic is called an overdose. This may occur suddenly, when a large amount of the drug is taken at one time, or gradually, as a drug builds up in the body over a longer period of time. Prompt medical attention may save the life of someone who accidentally or deliberately takes an overdose.)

Answer: 1. Check the patient's airway, breathing, and pulse. If necessary, begin CPR. If the patient is unconscious but breathing, carefully place him or her in the recovery position. If the patient is conscious, loosen the clothing, keep the person warm, and provide reassurance. Try to keep the patient calm. If an overdose is suspected, try to prevent the patient from taking more drugs. Call for immediate medical assistance.  2. Treat the patient for signs of shock, if necessary. Signs include: weakness, bluish lips and fingernails, clammy skin, paleness, and decreasing alertness.  3. If the patient is having seizures, give convulsion first aid.  4. Keep monitoring the patient's vital signs (pulse, rate of breathing, blood pressure) until emergency medical help arrives.  5. If possible, try to determine which drug(s) were taken and when.

ADAM_0001284_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Drug allergies ? (Also called: Allergic reaction - drug (medication); Drug hypersensitivity; Medication hypersensitivity)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000819.htm
Answer: Adverse reactions to drugs are common. (adverse means unwanted or unexpected.) Almost any drug can cause an adverse reaction. Reactions range from irritating or mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting to life-threatening anaphylaxis.  A true drug allergy is caused by a series of chemical steps in the body that produce the allergic reaction to a medication.  The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. However, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) called IgE against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the IgE tells your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine, which causes your allergy symptoms. A drug allergy may also occur without your body producing IgE. Instead, it might produce other types of antibodies, or have other reactions that do not produce antibodies.  Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medication or vaccine.  Common allergy-causing drugs include:  -  Anticonvulsants   -  Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin)   -  Iodinated (containing iodine) x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions)   -  Penicillin and related antibiotics   -  Sulfa drugs    Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause nonallergic hives or trigger asthma. Some drug reactions are considered idiosyncratic. This means the reaction is an unusual effect of the medication. It is not due to a known chemical effect of the drug. Many people confuse an uncomfortable, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a true drug allergy.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000819.htm
Answer: The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction.  Treatment may include:  -  Antihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching   -  Bronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough)   -  Corticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously)   - Epinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis    The offending medication and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your health care providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have.  In some cases, a penicillin (or other drug) allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. The desensitization should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000819.htm
Answer: There is generally no way to prevent a drug allergy.  If you have a known drug allergy, avoiding the medication is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction. You may also be told to avoid similar medicines.  In some cases, a health care provider may approve the use of a drug that causes an allergy if you are first treated with corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine). Do not try this without a health care provider's supervision. Pretreatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines has been shown to prevent anaphylaxis in people who need to get x-ray contrast dye.  Your health care provider may also recommend densensitization.)

ADAM_0002026_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about How to choose the best hospital for surgery
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007497.htm
Answer: Summary : The quality of the health care you receive depends on many things besides the skill of your surgeon. Many health care providers at a hospital will be directly involved in your care before, during, and after surgery.  The work of all the hospital staff affects how well the hospital functions. This affects your safety and the quality of the care you will receive there.  CHOOSING THE BEST HOSPITAL FOR SURGERY  A hospital can offer many things to improve the quality of care you receive. For example, find out if your hospital has:  - A floor or unit that does only the type of surgery you are having (For example, for hip replacement surgery, do they have a floor or unit that is used only for joint-replacement surgeries?)  - Operating rooms that are used only for your type of surgery  - Specific guidelines so that everyone who has your type of surgery receives the kind of care they need  - Enough nurses    It can also be helpful to know how many surgeries like yours have been done at the hospital you have chosen or are considering for your surgery. People who have surgery at hospitals that do more of the same type of procedure often do better.  If you are having a surgery that involves newer techniques, find out how many of these procedures your hospital has already done.  HIGH-QUALITY MEASURES  Hospitals are asked to report events called ""quality measures."" These measures are reports of different things that affect patient care. Some common quality measures include:  - Patient injuries, such as falls  - Patients who receive the wrong medicine or the wrong dosage of a medicine  - Complications, such as infections, blood clots, and pressure ulcers (bedsores)  - Readmission and death (mortality) rates    Hospitals receive scores for their quality. These scores can give you an idea of how your hospital compares to other hospitals.  Find out if your hospital is accredited by The Joint Commission (a nonprofit organization that seeks to improve the quality and safety of health care).  Also see if your hospital is rated highly by state agencies or consumer or other groups. Some places to look for hospital ratings are:  - State reports -- some states require hospitals to report certain information to them, and some publish reports that compare hospitals in the state.  - Nonprofit groups in some areas or states work with businesses, doctors, and hospitals to gather information about quality. You can look for this information online.  - The government gathers and reports information about hospitals. You can find this information online at www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov. You can also find information about choosing the best doctor online.  - Your health insurance company may rate and compare how different hospitals perform on the surgery you are having. Ask your insurance company if it does these ratings.)

Answer: Common kinds of drugs that are misused include depressants, opioids, and stimulants.  DEPRESSANTS  These medicines are also known as tranquilizers and sedatives. They are prescribed to treat anxiety and sleep problems.   Types of drugs and their street names include:  - Barbiturates, such as Amytal, Nembutal, Phenobarbital, Seconal. Street names include barbs, phennies, reds, red birds, tooies, yellows, yellow jackets  - Benzodiazepines, such as Ativan, Halcion, Klonopin Librium, Valium, Xanax. Street names include benzos, blues, candy, chill pills, french fries, downers, sleeping pills, totem poles, tranks, z-bar  - Other sleep medicines, such as Ambien, Sonata, Lunesta. Street names include A- , zombie pills    When used to get high, they cause feelings of well-being, intense happiness, and excitement. As street drugs, depressants come in pills or capsules and are usually swallowed.  Harmful effects of depressants on the body include:  - Decreased attention span  - Impaired judgment  - Lack of coordination  - Lowered blood pressure  - Memory problems  - Slurred speech    Long-time users may have life-threatening withdrawal symptoms if they try to stop the drug abruptly.  OPIOIDS  Opioids are powerful painkillers. They are prescribed to treat pain after surgery or a dental procedure. Sometimes they are used to treat severe cough or diarrhea.  Types of opioids and their street names include:  -  Codeine: There are many medicinesthatcontaincodeine as an ingredient, especially ones for cough such as Robitussin A-C and Tylenol with codeine. Street names for codeine alone include captain cody, cody, little c, and school boy.For Tylenol with codeine, street names includeT1, T2, T3, T4, and dors and fours. Codeine syrup mixed with soda can have street namses such as purple drank, sizzup, or Texas tea.  -  Fentanyl: Drugs include Actiq, Duragesic, Onsolis, and Sublimaze. Street names include apache, china girl, china white, dance fever, friend, goodfella, jackpot, murder 8, percopop, tango and cash.  -  Hydrocodone: Drugs include Lorcet, Lortab, and Vicodin. Street names include fluff, hydros, v-itamin, vic, vike, Watson-387.  -  Morphine: Drugs include Avinza, Duramorph, Kadian, Ormorph, Roxanol. Street names include dreamer, first line, god's drug, M, miss emma, mister blue, monkey, morf, morpho, vitamin m, white stuff.  -  Oxycodone: Drugs include Oxycontin, Percocet, Percodan, Tylox. Street names include cotton, hillbilly heroin, o.c., ox, oxy, oxycet, oxycotton, percs, pills.    When used to get high, opioids cause a person to feel relaxed and intensely happy. As street drugs, they come as powder, pills or capsules, syrup. They can be swallowed, injected, smoked, put into the rectum, or inhaled through the nose (snorted).  Harmful effects of opioids on the body include:  - Constipation  - Dry mouth  - Confusion  - Lack of coordination  - Lowered blood pressure  - Weakness, dizziness, sleepiness    In high doses, opioid intoxication can result, which can cause breathing problems, coma, or death.  STIMULANTS  These are drugs that stimulate the brain and body. They make the messages between the brain and body move faster. As a result, the person is more alert and physically active. Stimulants such as amphetaminesare prescribed to treat health problems such asobesity, narcolepsy, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  Types of stimulants and their street names include:  - Amphetamines, such as Adderall, Biphetamine, and Dexedrine. Street names include bennies, black beauties, crosses, hearts, LA turnaround, speed, truck drivers, uppers.  - Methylphenidate, such as Concerta, Metadate, Quillivant, and Ritalin.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001975.htm
Answer: Summary : As a parent, it is natural to worry about your teenager. And, like many parents, you may be afraid that your teen may try drugs, or worse, become dependent on drugs.  While you cannot control everything your teen does, you can take steps to help your child stay away from drugs. Start by learning all you can about drugs and drug abuse. Learn the signs of drug use so that you can be alert. Then use these tips to help prevent drug use in your teen.

Information : First, learn about the different types of drugs that may be used. Older teens are more likely to use drugs than younger teens. Marijuana (pot) is still common. More and more teens are using prescription drugs.   WHY TEENS USE DRUGS   There are many reasons why teens might use drugs. Some common reasons include:  - To fit in. Social status is very important to teens. Your teen may do drugs in an attempt to fit in with friends or impress a new group of kids.  - To be social. Some teens use drugs because it lowers their inhibitions and makes them more comfortable socially.  - To deal with life changes. Change is not easy for anyone. Some teens turn to drugs to deal with situations such as moving, starting at a new school, puberty, or going through their parents' divorce.  - To ease pain and anxiety. Teens may use drugs to deal with problems with family, friends, school, mental health, or self-esteem.    TALKING WITH YOUR TEEN ABOUT DRUGS   It is not easy, but it is important to talk with your teen about drugs. It is one of the best ways to prevent teen drug use. Here are some tips:  - DO NOT make it one ""big talk."" Instead, have ongoing conversations about drugs with your teen. Use news stories, TV shows, or movies as a starting point for conversations.  - DO NOT lecture. Instead, ask open-ended questions like, ""Why do you think those kids were using drugs?"" or, ""Have you ever been offered drugs?"" Your teen may respond in a more positive way if you have a real conversation.  - Let your teen know how you feel. Make it clear to your teen that you do not approve of drug use.  - Give your teen time to talk and listen without interrupting. This will show that you care about your child's opinion.  - Spend some time every day talking about what is going on in your teen's life. This will make it easier to talk when tougher subjects come up, like alcohol, drugs, and sex.    HELP PREVENT DRUG USE   While there is no surefire way to make sure your teen never does drugs, you can steps to help prevent it.  - Stay involved. Build a strong relationship with your teen and show support for his or her interests.  - Be a good role model. Your own behaviors send a direct message to your teen, whether you know it or not. DO NOT use drugs, and use prescription medicines only as directed. If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation.  - Meet and get to know your teen's friends. If possible, meet their parents too. Encourage your teen to invite friends over so you can get to know them better. If you think a friend is a bad influence, do not hesitate to step in or encourage your child to make other friends.  - Set clear rules for your teen about drug use. This may include not riding in a car with kids who have been doing drugs and not staying at a party where anyone is doing drugs.  - Know what your teen is doing. Teens who are unsupervised are more likely to experiment with drugs. Keep tabs on where your teen is and who he or she is with. Ask your teen to check in with you at certain times of the day, such as after school.  - Encourage healthy activities. Hobbies, clubs, sports, and part-time jobs are all great ways to keep teens busy. By staying active, your teen will have less time to get involved with drug use.    KNOW THE SIGNS   There are many physical and behavioral signs that point to drug use. Learn them and be aware if your teen acts or looks different. The signs include:  - Slow or slurred speech (from using downers and depressants)  - Rapid, explosive speech (from using uppers)  - Bloodshot eyes  - Cough that does not go away  - Unusual odor on breath (from using inhalant drugs)  - Pupils that are extremely big (dilated) or extremely small (pinpoint)  - Rapid eye motion (nystagmus), a possible sign of PCP use  - Loss of appetite (occurs with amphetamine, methamphetamine, or cocaine use)  - Increased appetite (with marijuana use)  - Unsteady gait    You may notice changes in your teen's energy level, such as:  - Sluggishness, listlessness, or constant sleeping (from using opiate drugs, such as heroin or codeine, or when coming down off stimulant drugs)  - Hyperactivity (as seen with uppers such as cocaine and methamphetamine)    You also may notice changes in your teen's behavior:  - Poor grades in school and missing more school days  - Not taking part in usual activities  - Change in group of friends  - Secretive activities  - Lying or stealing    HOW TO GET HELP   If you think your teen is using drugs, start by talking with your family health care provider. Your provider can help treat your teen, or can refer you to a drug specialist or treatment center. You can also look for resources in your community or local hospitals. Look for a specialist who has experience working with teenagers.  DO NOT hesitate, get help right away. The sooner you get help, the less likely your teen's drug use will turn into drug abuse.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a688016.html
Answer: Taking ciprofloxacin increases the risk that you will develop tendinitis (swelling of a fibrous tissue that connects a bone to a muscle) or have a tendon rupture (tearing of a fibrous tissue that connects a bone to a muscle) during your treatment or for up to several months afterward. These problems may affect tendons in your shoulder, your hand, the back of your ankle, or in other parts of your body. Tendinitis or tendon rupture may happen to people of any age, but the risk is highest in people over 60 years of age. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a kidney, heart, or lung transplant; kidney disease; a joint or tendon disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis (a condition in which the body attacks its own joints, causing pain, swelling, and loss of function); or if you participate in regular physical activity. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking oral or injectable steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexpak), methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Sterapred). If you experience any of the following symptoms of tendinitis, stop taking ciprofloxacin, rest, and call your doctor immediately: pain, swelling, tenderness, stiffness, or difficulty in moving a muscle. If you experience any of the following symptoms of tendon rupture, stop taking ciprofloxacin and get emergency medical treatment: hearing or feeling a snap or pop in a tendon area, bruising after an injury to a tendon area, or inability to move or to bear weight on an affected area.  Taking ciprofloxacin may worsen muscle weakness in people with myasthenia gravis (a disorder of the nervous system that causes muscle weakness) and cause severe difficulty breathing or death. Tell your doctor if you have myasthenia gravis. Your doctor may tell you not to take ciprofloxacin. If you have myasthenia gravis and your doctor tells you that you should take ciprofloxacin, call your doctor immediately if you experience muscle weakness or difficulty breathing during your treatment.  Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking ciprofloxacin.  Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with ciprofloxacin. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a688016.html
Answer: Ciprofloxacin comes as a tablet, a suspension (liquid), and an extended-release tablet to take by mouth. The tablet and suspension are usually taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, with or without food. The extended-release tablets are usually taken once a day. Cipro XR brand extended-release tablets may be taken with or without food. Proquin XR brand extended-release tablets should be taken with a main meal of the day, preferably the evening meal. Take ciprofloxacin at around the same time(s) every day. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have. Your doctor will tell you how long to take ciprofloxacin. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ciprofloxacin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  One brand or type of ciprofloxacin cannot be substituted for another. Be sure that you receive only the brand or type of ciprofloxacin that was prescribed by your doctor. Ask your pharmacist if you have any questions about the type of ciprofloxacin you were given.  Do not take ciprofloxacin with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices alone. However, you may take ciprofloxacin with a meal that includes these foods or drinks.  Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, crush, or chew them. If you cannot swallow tablets whole, tell your doctor.  If you are taking the suspension, shake the bottle very well for 15 seconds before each use to mix the medication evenly. Swallow the correct dose without chewing the granules in the suspension. Close the bottle completely after each use. Do not give the suspension to a patient through a feeding tube.  You should begin feeling better during the first few days of your treatment with ciprofloxacin. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor. If you are being treated for a urinary tract infection, call your doctor if you develop fever or back pain during or after your treatment. These symptoms may be signs that your infection is worsening.  Take ciprofloxacin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. Do not stop taking ciprofloxacin without talking to your doctor unless you experience certain serious side effects listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING and SIDE EFFECTS sections If you stop taking ciprofloxacin too soon or if you skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007618.htm
Answer: Anemia caused by a low iron level is the most common form of anemia. The body gets iron through certain foods. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells.  A diet that does not have enough iron is the most common cause. During periods of rapid growth, even more iron is needed.  Babies are born with iron stored in their bodies. Because they grow rapidly, infants and toddlers need to absorb a lot of iron each day. Iron deficiency anemia most commonly affects babies 9 through 24 months old.   Breastfed babies need less iron because iron is absorbed better when it is in breast milk. Formula with iron added (iron fortified) also provides enough iron.  Infants younger than 12 months who drink cow's milk rather than breast milk or iron-fortified formula are more likely to have anemia. Cow's milk leads to anemia because it:  - Has less iron  - Causes small amounts of blood loss from the intestines  - Makes it harder for the body to absorb iron   Children older than 12 months who drink too much cow's milk may also have anemia if they do not eat enough other healthy foods that have iron.)

ADAM_0000424_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Benign positional vertigo ? (Also called: Vertigo - positional; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; BPPV: dizziness- positional)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001420.htm
Answer: Benign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It is caused by a problem in the inner ear.   The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. When you move, the fluid moves inside these tubes. The canals are very sensitive to any movement of the fluid. The sensation of the fluid moving in the tube tells your brain the position of your body. This helps you keep your balance.  BPPV occurs when a small piece of bone-like calcium breaks free and floats inside the tube. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position.  BPPV has no major risk factors. But, your risk for developing BPPV may increase if you have:  - Family members with BPPV  - Had a prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head)  - Had an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis)

ADAM_0001041_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Crying - excessive (0 to 6 months) (Also called: Excessive crying (infants 0 to 6 months))
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003023.htm
Answer: Summary : Infants normally cry about 1 to 3 hours a day. It is perfectly normal for an infant to cry when hungry, thirsty, tired, lonely, or in pain. It is also normal for a baby to have a fussy period in the evening.  But, if an infant cries too often, it may be a sign of something that needs treatment.

Causes : Infants may cry because of any of the following:  - Boredom or loneliness  - Colic  - Discomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or feeling cold  - Hunger or thirst  - Illness  - Infection (a likely cause if the crying is accompanied by irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, or fever. You should call your baby's health care provider)  - Medicines  - Normal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep  - Pain  - Teething

Home Care : Home care depends on the causes. Follow your provider's advice.   If the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.  If crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.  Take your baby's temperature to check for fever. Check your baby head-to-toe for any injuries. Pay particular attention to the fingers, toes, and genitalia. It is not uncommon for a hair to get wrapped around part of your baby, such as a toe, creating pain.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Call the provider if:  - A baby's excessive crying remains unexplained and does not go away in 1 day, despite attempts at home treatment  - The baby has other symptoms, such as fever, along with the excessive crying

What to Expect at Your Office Visit : The provider will examine your baby and ask about the child's medical history and symptoms. Questions may include:  - Is the child teething?  - Is the child bored, lonely, hungry, thirsty?  - Does the child seem to have a lot of gas?  - What other symptoms does the child have? Such as, difficulty waking up, fever, irritability, poor appetite, or vomiting?    The provider will check the infant's growth and development. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the baby has a bacterial infection.)

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Deafness, autosomal dominant nonsyndromic sensorineural 22. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Sensorineural hearing impairment - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/emanuel-syndrome
Answer: Emanuel syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that disrupts normal development and affects many parts of the body. Infants with Emanuel syndrome have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Their development is significantly delayed, and most affected individuals have severe to profound intellectual disability.  Other features of Emanuel syndrome include an unusually small head (microcephaly), distinctive facial features, and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). Ear abnormalities are common, including small holes in the skin just in front of the ears (preauricular pits or sinuses). About half of all affected infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) or a high arched palate. Males with Emanuel syndrome often have genital abnormalities. Additional signs of this condition can include heart defects and absent or unusually small (hypoplastic) kidneys; these problems can be life-threatening in infancy or childhood.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/emanuel-syndrome
Answer: Emanuel syndrome is caused by the presence of extra genetic material from chromosome 11 and chromosome 22 in each cell. In addition to the usual 46 chromosomes, people with Emanuel syndrome have an extra (supernumerary) chromosome consisting of a piece of chromosome 11 attached to a piece of chromosome 22. The extra chromosome is known as a derivative 22 or der(22) chromosome.  As a result of the extra chromosome, people with Emanuel syndrome have three copies of some genes in each cell instead of the usual two copies. The excess genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, leading to the characteristic signs and symptoms of this disorder. Researchers are working to determine which genes are included on the der(22) chromosome and what role these genes play in development.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/emanuel-syndrome
Answer: Almost everyone with Emanuel syndrome inherits the der(22) chromosome from an unaffected parent. The parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement between chromosomes 11 and 22 called a balanced translocation. No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. However, translocations can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Individuals with Emanuel syndrome inherit an unbalanced translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 that introduces extra genetic material in the form of the der(22) chromosome. This extra genetic material causes birth defects and the other health problems characteristic of this disorder.)

Answer: Questions your provider may ask may include:  - Is your back pain on one side only or both sides?  - What does the pain feel like? Is it dull, sharp, throbbing, or burning?  - Is this the first time you have had back pain?  - When did the pain begin? Did it start suddenly?  - Did you have an injury or accident?  - What were you doing just before the pain began? For example, were you lifting or bending? Sitting at your computer? Driving a long distance?  - If you have had back pain before, is this pain similar or different? In what way is it different?  - Do you know what caused your back pain in the past?  - How long does each episode of back pain usually last?  - Do you feel the pain anywhere else, such as in your hip, thigh, leg or feet?  - Do you have any numbness or tingling? Any weakness or loss of function in your leg or elsewhere?  - What makes the pain worse? Lifting, twisting, standing, or sitting for long periods?  - What makes you feel better?    You will also be asked if you have other symptoms, which may point to a more serious cause. Tell your provider if you have had weight loss, fever, a change in urination or bowel habits, or a history of cancer.  Your provider will perform a physical exam to try to find the exact location of your pain, and determine how it affects your movement. Your back will be pressed on in different spots to find where it hurts. You will also be asked to:  - Sit, stand, and walk  - Walk on your toes and then your heels  - Bend forward, backward, and sideways  - Lift your legs straight up while lying down    If the pain is worse when you lift your legs straight up while lying down, you may have sciatica, especially if you also feel numbness or tingling going down the same leg.  Your provider will also move your legs into different positions, including bending and straightening your knees.  A rubber hammer is used to check your reflexes and to see if your nerves are working properly. Your provider will touch your skin in many places, using a pin, cotton swab, or feather. This reveals how well you can feel or sense things.)

ADAM_0000787_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Child safety seats (Also called: Child car seats; Infant car seats; Car seats; Car safety seats)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000670.htm
Answer: Summary : Child safety seats are proven to save children's lives in accidents.  In the United States, all states require children to be secured in a car seat or booster seat until they are 4' 9"" tall. Most children grow to this height when they are between 8 and 12 years old.  To keep your child safe, keep these tips in mind when using a car safety seat.  - When your child is born, you must have a car seat to bring the baby home from the hospital.  - Always secure your child in a car seat whenever riding in a vehicle. Make sure the harness is fastened snugly.  - Read the car seat manufacturer's instructions for the proper way to use the seat. Read your vehicle owner's manual, too.  - Car seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. If there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. This can ONLY be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off.    When you are selecting a child safety seat for the first time:  - The seat must fit your child's size and be able to be properly installed in your vehicle.  - It is best to use a new car seat. Used car seats often do not have instructions. They may have cracks or other problems that make the seat unsafe. For example, the seat may have been damaged during a car accident.  - Try the seat before buying it. Install the seat in your vehicle. Put your child in the car seat. Secure the harness and buckle. Check that the seat fits your vehicle and child.  - DO NOT use a car seat past its expiration date. The seat frame may no longer be strong enough to support your child safely. The expiration date is usually on the bottom of the seat.  - DO NOT use a seat that has been recalled. Fill out and send in the registration card that comes with the new car seat. The manufacturer can contact you if the seat is recalled. You can find out about recalls by contacting the manufacturer, or by looking up safety complaints records on your child's safety seat at www.safercar.gov/parents/CarSeats/Car-Seat-Safety.htm.    The types of child safety seats and restraints include:  - Rear-facing seats  - Forward-facing seats  - Booster seats  - Car beds  - Built-in car seats  - Travel vests    REAR-FACING SEATS   A rear-facing seat is one in which your child faces the back of the vehicle. The seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle. The two types of rear-facing seats are the infant-only seat and the convertible seat.  Infant-only rear-facing seats. These seats are for babies who weigh up to 22 to 30 pounds, depending on the car seat. You will need a new seat when your child gets bigger. Infant-only seats have handles so you can carry the seat to and from the car. Some have a base you can leave installed in the car. This lets you click the car seat into place each time you use it. Follow manufacturer's instructions on how the seat should be reclined so your baby's head does not shift around while you are driving.  Convertible seats. These seats are to be placed in the rear-facing position and are for infants and toddlers. When your child is older and bigger, the seat can be switched to the forward-facing position. Experts recommend keeping your child rear-facing until at least age 2 and until your child outgrows the weight or height allowed by the seat.  FORWARD-FACING SEATS   A forward-facing seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle, although it allows your child to face the front of the car. These seats are used only after your child is too big for a rear-facing seat.  A combination forward-facing booster seat may also be used. For younger children, the booster seat's harness straps should be used. After your child reaches the upper height and weight limit for the harness (based on the seat's instructions), the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts can be used to keep your child strapped in.   BOOSTER SEATS  A booster seat raises your child up so the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts fit correctly. The lap belt should fall across your child's upper thighs. The shoulder belt should go across the middle of your child's shoulder and chest.  Use booster seats for older children until they are 4' 9"" tall and between 8 and 12 years old.  CAR BEDS  These seats are also called flat car seats. They are used for premature or other special-needs babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends having a health care provider look at how your preterm baby fits and breathes in a car seat before leaving the hospital.  BUILT-IN SEATS  Some vehicles have built-in car seats. Weight and height limits vary. You can get more details on these seats by reading the vehicle owner's manual or calling the vehicle manufacturer.  TRAVEL VESTS  Special vests can be worn by older children who have outgrown forward-facing safety seats. The vests can be used instead of booster seats. The vests are used with the vehicle's lap and seat belts. As with car seats, children should be sitting in the back seat when using the vest.)

ADAM_0003951_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Toddler development
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002010.htm
Answer: Summary : Toddlers are children ages 1 - 3.  CHILD DEVELOPMENT THEORIES  Cognitive (thought) development skills typical for toddlers include:  - Early use of instruments or tools  - Following visual (then later, invisible) displacement (moving from one place to another) of objects  - Understanding that objects and people are there, even if you can't see them (object and people permanence)    Personal-social development in the toddler stage focuses on the child learning to adjust to society's demands, while trying to maintain independence and a sense of self.   These milestones are typical of children in the toddler stages. Some variation is normal. Talk to your health care provider if you have questions about your child's development.   PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT  The following are signs of expected physical development in a toddler:  GROSS MOTOR SKILLS (use of large muscles in the legs and arms)  - Stands alone well by 12 months  - Walks well by 12 - 15 months (Ifa child is not walking by 18 months, he or she should be evaluated by a health care provider.)  - Learns to walk backwards and up steps with help at about 16 - 18 months  - Jumps in place by about 24 months  - Rides a tricycle and stands briefly on one foot by about 36 months    FINE MOTOR SKILLS (use of small muscles in hands and fingers)  - Makes tower of three cubes by around 15 months  - Scribbles by 15 - 18 months  - Can use spoon by 24 months  - Can copy a circle by 36 months    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT  - Uses 2 - 3 words (other than Mama or Dada) at 12 - 15 months  - Understands and follows simple commands (such as ""bring to Mommy"") at 14 - 16 months  - Names pictures of items and animals at 18 - 24 months  - Points to named body parts at 18 - 24 months  - Begins to say his or her own name at 22 - 24 months  - Combines 2 words at 16 to 24 months (There is a range of ages at which children are first able to combine words into sentences. Talk to your child's health care provider if the toddler cannot make sentences by 24 months.)  - Knows gender and age by 36 months    SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT  - Indicates some needs by pointing at 12 - 15 months  - Looks for help when in trouble by 18 months  - Helps to undress and put things away by 18 - 24 months  - Listens to stories when shown pictures and can tell aboutrecent experiences by 24 months  - Cantake partin pretend play and simple games by 24 - 36 months    BEHAVIOR  Toddlers are always trying to be more independent. This creates safety concerns as well as discipline challenges. The child must be consistently taught the limits of appropriate vs. inappropriate behavior.  When toddlers try out activities they haven't yet mastered, they can get frustrated and angry. Breath-holding, crying, screaming, and temper tantrums may often occur.  It is important for a child at this stage to:  - Learn from experiences  - Rely on boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors    SAFETY  Toddler safety is very important.  - Parents need to be aware that the child can now walk, run, climb, jump, and explore. This new stage of movement makes child-proofing the home very important. Window guards, gates on stairways, cabinet locks, toilet seat locks, electric outlet covers, and other safety features are needed to keep the child safe.  - Put the toddler in a safety restraint (toddler car seat) when riding in a car.  - Do not leave a toddler unattended for even short periods of time. Remember, more accidents occur during the toddler years than at any other stage of childhood.  - Make clear rules about not playing in streets or crossing without an adult.  - Falls are a major cause of injury. Keep gates or doors to stairways closed, and use guards for all windows above the ground floor. Do not leave chairs or ladders in areas that are likely to tempt the toddler into climbing up to explore new heights. Use corner guards on furniture in areas where the toddler is likely to walk, play, or run.  - Poisoning is a common cause of toddler illness and death. Keep all medicines in a locked cabinet. Keep all toxic household products (polishes, acids, cleaning solutions, chlorine bleach, lighter fluid, insecticides, or poisons) in a locked cabinet or closet. Many household and garden plants, such as toad stools, may cause serious illness or death if eaten. Ask your child's health care provider for a list of common poisonous plants.  - If someone in the household owns a firearm, make sure it is unloaded and locked in a secure place.  - Keep toddlers away from the kitchen with a safety gate, or place them in a playpen or high chair. This will eliminate the danger of burns from pulling hot foods off the stove or bumping into the hot oven door.  - Do not let toddlers play in water alone. A toddler may drown, even in shallow water in a bathtub. Parent-child swimming lessons can be another safe and enjoyable way for toddlers to play in water. Never leave a child unattended near a pool, open toilet, or bathtub. Toddlers cannot learn how to swim and cannot be independent near any body of water.    PARENTING TIPS  - The toddler years are for children to learn accepted rules of behavior. It is important for parents to be consistent both in modeling behavior (behaving the way you want your child to behave), and in pointing out inappropriate behavior in the child. Recognize and reward positive behavior. You can introduce time-outs for negative behavior, or for going beyond the limits you set for your child.  - The toddler's favorite word may seem to be ""NO!!!"" It is important for parents not to fall into a pattern of negative behaviorusing yelling, spanking, and threats.  - Teach children the proper names of body parts.  - Stress the unique, individual qualities of the child.  - Teach the concepts of please, thank you, and sharing with others.  - Read to the child regularly. This will help develop verbal skills.  - Toddlers thrive on regularity. Major changes in their routine are hard for them. Toddlers should have regular nap, bed, snack, and meal times.  - Toddlers should not be allowed to eat many snacks throughout the day. Too many snacks can take away the desire to eat regular meals, which tend to offer more balanced nutrition.   - Traveling with a toddler or having guests at the house can disrupt the childs routine. This may make the child more irritable. In these situations, reassure the child and try to get back to a routine in a calm way.)

MPlusHealthTopics_0000896_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Toddler Development
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/toddlerdevelopment.html
Answer: Summary : Mastering new skills such as how to walk, talk, and use the potty are developmental milestones. It is exciting to watch your toddler learn new skills. The normal development of children aged 1-3 can be broken down into the following areas:       - Gross motor - walking, running, climbing    - Fine motor - feeding themselves, drawing    - Sensory - seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, and smelling    - Language - saying single words, then sentences    - Social - playing with others, taking turns, doing fantasy play       Toddlers do not develop at the same rate. There is a wide range of what is considered ""normal."" Your child may be ahead in some areas and slightly behind in others. If you are worried about possible delays, talk to your child's health care provider.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003763.htm
Answer: Summary : An ear drainage culture is a lab test to check for infection-causing substances in a sample of fluid, pus, wax, or blood from the ear.

How the Test is Performed : A sample of ear drainage is needed. Your health care provider will use a cotton swab to collect the sample from inside the outer ear canal. In some cases, a sample is collected from the middle ear during ear surgery.  The sample is sent to a lab and placed on a special dish (culture media).  The lab team checks the dish every day to see if bacteria, fungi, or viruses have grown. More tests may be done to look for specific substances and determine the best treatment.

How to Prepare for the Test : You do not need to prepare for this test.

How the Test will Feel : Using a cotton swab to take a sample of drainage from the outer ear is not painful. However, ear pain may be present if the ear is infected.  Ear surgery is done using general anesthesia. You will be asleep and feel no pain.

Why the Test is Performed : The test may be done if you or your child has:  - An ear infection that is not getting better with treatment  - An infection of the outer ear (otitis externa)  - An ear infection with a ruptured eardrum and draining fluid    It may also be done as a routine part of myringotomy.  Note: Ear infections are diagnosed based on symptoms rather than using a culture.

Normal Results : The test is normal if there is no growth on the culture.  Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may be a sign of infection by bacteria, virus, or fungus.  The test results may show which organism is causing the infection. It will help your doctor decide on the right treatment.

Risks : No risks are involved with swabbing the ear canal. Ear surgery may involve some risks.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007010.htm
Answer: The Eustachian tube connects the inside of the ear to the back of the throat. This tube helps drain fluid to prevent it from building up in the ear. The fluid drains from the tube and is swallowed.  Otitis media with effusion (OME) and ear infections are connected in two ways:  - After most ear infections have been treated, fluid (an effusion) remains in the middle ear for a few days or weeks.  - When the Eustachian tube is partially blocked, fluid builds up in the middle ear. Bacteria inside the ear become trapped and begin to grow. This may lead to an ear infection.    The following can cause swelling of the Eustachian tube lining that leads to increased fluid:  - Allergies  - Irritants (especially cigarette smoke)  - Respiratory infections    The following can cause the Eustachian tube to close or become blocked:  - Drinking while lying on your back  - Sudden increases in air pressure (such as descending in an airplane or on a mountain road)    Getting water in a baby's ears will not lead to a blocked tube.  OME is most common in winter or early spring, but it can occur at any time of year. It can affect people of any age. It occurs most often in children under age 2, but is rare in newborns.  Younger children get OME more often than older children or adults for several reasons:  - The tube is shorter, more horizontal, and straighter, making it easier for bacteria to enter.  - The tube is floppier, with a tinier opening that's easy to block.  - Young children get more colds because it takes time for the immune system to be able to recognize and ward off cold viruses.    The fluid in OME is often thin and watery. In the past, it was thought that the fluid got thicker the longer it was present in the ear. (""Glue ear"" is a common name given to OME with thick fluid.) However, fluid thickness is now thought to berelated to the ear itself, rather than to how long the fluid is present.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007010.htm
Answer: Most health care providers will not treat OME at first, unless there are also signs of an infection. Instead, they will recheck the problem in 2 to 3 months.  Some children who have had repeat ear infections may receive a small, daily dose of antibiotics to prevent new infections.  You can make the following changes to help clear up the fluid behind the eardrum:  - Avoid cigarette smoke  - Encourage infants to breastfeed  - Treat allergies by staying away from triggers (such as dust). Adults and older children may be given allergy medications.    Most often the fluid will clear on its own. You doctor may suggest watching the condition for a while to see if it is getting worse before recommending treatment.  If the fluid is still present after 6 weeks, the doctor may recommend:  - Continuing to watch the problem  - A hearing test  - A single trial of antibiotics (if they were not given earlier)    If the fluid is still present at 8 to 12 weeks, antibiotics may be tried. These medicines are not always helpful.  At some point, the child's hearing should be tested.  If there is significant hearing loss (more than 20 decibels), antibiotics or ear tubes might be needed.  If the fluid is still present after 4 to 6 months, tubes are probably needed, even if there is no major hearing loss.  Sometimes the adenoids must be taken out for the Eustachian tube to work properly.)

Answer: The provider may prescribe antibiotics if the infection is caused by bacteria. These medicines may need to be taken for a long time.

MPlusHealthTopics_0000311_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Ear Infections ? (Also called: Otitis media)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/earinfections.html
Answer: Ear infections are the most common reason parents bring their child to a doctor. Three out of four children will have at least one ear infection by their third birthday. Adults can also get ear infections, but they are less common.    The infection usually affects the middle ear and is called otitis media. The tubes inside the ears become clogged with fluid and mucus. This can affect hearing, because sound cannot get through all that fluid.    If your child isn't old enough to say ""My ear hurts,"" here are a few things to look for       - Tugging at ears    - Crying more than usual    - Fluid draining from the ear    - Trouble sleeping    - Balance difficulties    - Hearing problems       Your health care provider will diagnose an ear infection by looking inside the ear with an instrument called an otoscope.    Often, ear infections go away on their own. Your health care provider may recommend pain relievers. Severe infections and infections in young babies may require antibiotics.     Children who get infections often may need surgery to place small tubes inside their ears. The tubes relieve pressure in the ears so that the child can hear again.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000819.htm
Answer: Adverse reactions to drugs are common. (adverse means unwanted or unexpected.) Almost any drug can cause an adverse reaction. Reactions range from irritating or mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting to life-threatening anaphylaxis.  A true drug allergy is caused by a series of chemical steps in the body that produce the allergic reaction to a medication.  The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. However, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) called IgE against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the IgE tells your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine, which causes your allergy symptoms. A drug allergy may also occur without your body producing IgE. Instead, it might produce other types of antibodies, or have other reactions that do not produce antibodies.  Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medication or vaccine.  Common allergy-causing drugs include:  -  Anticonvulsants   -  Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin)   -  Iodinated (containing iodine) x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions)   -  Penicillin and related antibiotics   -  Sulfa drugs    Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause nonallergic hives or trigger asthma. Some drug reactions are considered idiosyncratic. This means the reaction is an unusual effect of the medication. It is not due to a known chemical effect of the drug. Many people confuse an uncomfortable, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a true drug allergy.)

Answer: There is generally no way to prevent a drug allergy.  If you have a known drug allergy, avoiding the medication is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction. You may also be told to avoid similar medicines.  In some cases, a health care provider may approve the use of a drug that causes an allergy if you are first treated with corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine). Do not try this without a health care provider's supervision. Pretreatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines has been shown to prevent anaphylaxis in people who need to get x-ray contrast dye.

ADAM_0004363_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about 25-hydroxy vitamin D test (Also called: 25-OH vitamin D test; Calcidiol; 25-hydroxycholecalciferol test)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003569.htm
Answer: Summary : The 25-hydroxy vitamin D test is the most accurate way to measure how much vitamin D is in your body.  In the kidney, 25-hydroxy vitamin D changes into an active form of the vitamin. The active form of vitamin D helps control calcium and phosphate levels in the body.  This article discusses the blood test used to measure the amount of 25-hydroxy vitamin D.

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.

How to Prepare for the Test : Usually you will not need to fast. However, this depends on the laboratory and the testing method used.

How the Test Will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.

Why the Test is Performed : This test is done to determine if you have too much or too little vitamin D in your blood.

Normal Results : The normal range of vitamin D is measured as nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Many experts recommend a level between 20 and 40 ng/mL. Others recommend a level between 30 and 50 ng/mL.  The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some laboratories use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results, and whether you may need vitamin D supplements.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Lower-than-normal levels can be due to a vitamin D deficiency, which can result from:  - Lack of exposure to sunlight  - Lack of enough vitamin D in the diet  - Liver and kidney diseases  - Poor food absorption  - Use of certain medicines, including phenytoin, phenobarbital, and rifampin    Low vitamin D levels are more common in African-American children (especially in the winter), as well as in infants who are breastfed only. Low vitamin D levels have also been associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. For more information, see the article on vitamin D deficiency.  Higher-than-normal levelsmay be due to excess vitamin D, a condition called hypervitaminosis D.

Risks : Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.  Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling light-headed  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken))

Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Epileptic encephalopathy - Muscular hypotonia of the trunk - Status epilepticus - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.)

Answer: Most of the time, medicines make our lives better. They reduce aches and pains, fight infections, and control problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes. But medicines can also cause unwanted reactions.    One problem is interactions, which may occur between       - Two drugs, such as aspirin and blood thinners    - Drugs and food, such as statins and grapefruit    - Drugs and supplements, such as gingko and blood thinners    - Drugs and diseases, such as aspirin and peptic ulcers       Interactions can change the actions of one or both drugs. The drugs might not work, or you could get side effects.    Side effects are unwanted effects caused by the drugs. Most are mild, such as a stomach aches or drowsiness, and go away after you stop taking the drug. Others can be more serious.    Drug allergies are another type of reaction. They can be mild or life-threatening. Skin reactions, such as hives and rashes, are the most common type. Anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction, is more rare.    When you start a new prescription or over-the-counter medication, make sure you understand how to take it correctly. Know which other medications and foods you need to avoid. Ask your health care provider or pharmacist if you have questions.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a697042.html
Answer: Carvedilol is used to treat heart failure (condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to all parts of the body) and high blood pressure. It also is used to treat people who have had a heart attack. Carvedilol is often used in combination with other medications. Carvedilol is in a class of medications called beta-blockers. It works by relaxing blood vessels and slowing heart rate to improve blood flow and decrease blood pressure   High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure.

MPlusHealthTopics_0000301_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Drug Reactions ? (Also called: Side effects)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/drugreactions.html
Answer: Most of the time, medicines make our lives better. They reduce aches and pains, fight infections, and control problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes. But medicines can also cause unwanted reactions.    One problem is interactions, which may occur between       - Two drugs, such as aspirin and blood thinners    - Drugs and food, such as statins and grapefruit    - Drugs and supplements, such as gingko and blood thinners    - Drugs and diseases, such as aspirin and peptic ulcers       Interactions can change the actions of one or both drugs. The drugs might not work, or you could get side effects.    Side effects are unwanted effects caused by the drugs. Most are mild, such as a stomach aches or drowsiness, and go away after you stop taking the drug. Others can be more serious.    Drug allergies are another type of reaction. They can be mild or life-threatening. Skin reactions, such as hives and rashes, are the most common type. Anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction, is more rare.    When you start a new prescription or over-the-counter medication, make sure you understand how to take it correctly. Know which other medications and foods you need to avoid. Ask your health care provider or pharmacist if you have questions.)

MPlusDrugs_0000203_Sec2.txt,"Question: How should Carvedilol be used and what is the dosage ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a697042.html
Answer: Carvedilol comes as a tablet and an extended-release (long-acting) capsule to take by mouth. The tablet is usually taken twice a day with food. The extended-release capsule is usually taken once a day in the morning with food. Try to take carvedilol at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take carvedilol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Swallow the extended-release capsules whole. Do not chew or crush the capsules, and do not divide the beads inside a capsule into more than one dose. If you are unable to swallow the capsules, you may carefully open a capsule and sprinkle all of the beads it contains over a spoonful of cool or room temperature applesauce. Swallow the entire mixture immediately without chewing.  Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of carvedilol and gradually increase your dose to allow your body to adjust to the medication. Talk to your doctor about how you feel and about any symptoms you experience during this time.  Carvedilol may help to control your condition but will not cure it. Continue taking carvedilol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking carvedilol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking carvedilol, you may experience serious heart problems such as severe chest pain, a heart attack, or an irregular heartbeat. Your doctor will probably want to decrease your dose gradually over 1 to 2 weeks. Your doctor will watch you carefully and will probably tell you to avoid physical activity during this time.)

Your doctor may tell you not to take carvedilol.  - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had problems with blood flow in your feet or legs, diabetes or any other condition that causes you to have low blood sugar, hyperthyroidism (condition in which there is too much thyroid hormone in the body), low blood pressure, Prinzmetal's angina (chest pain that comes at rest with no obvious cause), or pheochromocytoma (a tumor that develops on a gland near the kidneys and may cause high blood pressure and fast heartbeat). Also tell your doctor if you have ever had a serious allergic reaction to a food or any other substance.  - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking carvedilol, call your doctor.  - if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking carvedilol.  - you should know that this medication may make you feel tired, dizzy, or lightheaded, especially when you start taking carvedilol and when your dose is increased. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you. Be especially careful during the first hour after you take the medication.  - do not drink any alcoholic drinks or take any prescription or nonprescription medications that contain alcohol for 2 hours before and 2 hours after you take carvedilol extended-release capsules. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not know if a medication that you plan to take contains alcohol.  - you should know that carvedilol may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting, especially when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is more common when you first start taking carvedilol. To avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up.  - if you wear contact lenses, your eyes may become dry during your treatment with carvedilol. Tell your doctor if this becomes bothersome.)

ADAM_0004299_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about When you feel like changing your medicine (Also called: Medication - non-compliance; Medication - nonadherence)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000616.htm
Answer: Summary : You may find a time when you want to stop or change your medicine. But changing or stopping your medicine on your own can be dangerous. It could make your condition worse.  Learn how to talk to your doctor and pharmacist about your medicine. You can make decisions together so you feel well with your medicines.

Common Reasons for Changing Medicine : You may think about stopping or changing your medicine when you:  - Feel better  - Think it is not working  - Are having side effects and feel bad  - Are worried about the costs

Do Not Stop Taking Your Medicine When You Feel Better : You often feel better quickly from taking some medicine. You may feel like you do not need to take it anymore.  If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you will not get its full effect, or your condition can get worse. Here are some examples:  - When you take antibiotics, you will feel better in 1 to 2 days. If you stop taking the medicine early, you may get sick again.  - If you are taking a steroid pack for your asthma, you will feel better quickly. You may think you can stop taking it because you feel so good. Suddenly stopping a steroid pack can make you feel very sick.

Do Not Stop Taking Your Medicine If You Think It Isn’t Working : If you do not feel better, you may think your medicine is not working. Talk to your doctor before you make any changes. Find out:  - What to expect from the medicine. Some medicines may take more time to make a difference.  - If you are taking the medicine correctly  - If there is another medicine that may work better

If Your Medicine Makes You Feel Sick, Talk to Your Doctor : Some medicines may make you feel sick. You may have a sick stomach, itchy skin, dry throat, or something else that does not feel right.  When your medicine makes you feel sick, you may want to stop taking it. Talk to your doctor before stopping any medicine. The doctor may:  - Change your dose so you do not feel sick from it.  - Change your medicine to a different kind.  - Give you suggestions on how to feel better when taking the medicine.

Talk to Your Doctor If You Can’t Afford Your Medicine : Medicines can cost a lot of money. If you are worried about money, you may want to cut costs.  DO NOT cut pills in half unless your doctor tells you to. DO NOT take fewer doses than prescribed or take your medicine only when you feel bad. Doing so can make your condition worse.  Talk to your doctor if you do not have enough money for your medicine. Your doctor may be able to change your medicine to a generic brand that costs less. Many pharmacies and drug companies have programs for reducing patient costs.

When to Call the Doctor : Call the doctor when you feel like changing your medicine. Know all the medicines that you take. Tell your doctor about your prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs, and any vitamins, supplements, or herbs. Together with your doctor, decide what medicines you will take.

Phenteramine is a controlled substance. Prescriptions may be refilled only a limited number of times; ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription.

MPlusHerbsSuppls_0000040_Sec5.txt,"Question: Are there interactions between Glucosamine hydrochloride and other medications ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/747.html
Answer: Major       Do not take this combination.       Warfarin (Coumadin)       Warfarin (Coumadin) is used to slow blood clotting. There are several reports showing that taking glucosamine hydrochloride with or without chondroitin increases the effect of warfarin (Coumadin) on blood clotting. This can cause bruising and bleeding that can be serious. Don't take glucosamine hydrochloride if you are taking warfarin (Coumadin).       Moderate       Be cautious with this combination.       Medications for cancer (Antimitotic chemotherapy)       Some medications for cancer work by decreasing how fast cancer cells can copy themselves. Some scientists think that glucosamine might increase how fast tumor cells can copy themselves. Taking glucosamine hydrochloride along with some medications for cancer might decrease the effectiveness of these medications.         Some medications used for cancer include etoposide (VP16, VePesid) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin).       Minor       Be watchful with this combination.       Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others)       There is some concern that taking glucosamine hydrochloride and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) together might affect how well each works. However, more information is needed to know if this interaction is a big concern.       Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)       There has been concern that glucosamine hydrochloride might increase blood sugar in people with diabetes. There has also been concern that glucosamine hydrochloride might decrease how well medications used for diabetes work. However, research now indicates that glucosamine hydrochloride probably does not increase blood sugar in people with diabetes. Therefore, glucosamine hydrochloride probably does not interfere with diabetes medications. To be cautious, if you take glucosamine hydrochloride and have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar closely.         Some medications used for diabetes include glimepiride (Amaryl), glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase PresTab, Micronase), insulin, pioglitazone (Actos), rosiglitazone (Avandia), chlorpropamide (Diabinese), glipizide (Glucotrol), tolbutamide (Orinase), and others.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a612037.html
Answer: Phentermine and topiramate come as extended-release capsules to take by mouth. The medication is usually taken with or without food once a day in the morning. This medication may cause difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep if it is taken in the evening. Take phentermine and topiramate at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take phentermine and topiramate exactly as directed.  Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of phentermine and topiramate and increase your dose after 14 days. After you take this dose for 12 weeks, your doctor will check to see how much weight you have lost. If you have not lost a certain amount of weight, your doctor may tell you to stop taking phentermine and topiramate or may increase your dose and then increase it again after 14 days. After you take the new dose for 12 weeks, your doctor will check to see how much weight you have lost. If you have not lost a certain amount of weight, it is not likely that you will benefit from taking phentermine and topiramate, so your doctor will probably tell you to stop taking the medication.  Phentermine and topiramate may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.  Phentermine and topiramate will help control your weight only as long as you continue to take the medication. Do not stop taking phentermine and topiramate without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking phentermine and topiramate, you may experience seizures. Your doctor will tell you how to decrease your dose gradually.  Phentermine and topiramate is not available at retail pharmacies. This medication is available only through specific mail order pharmacies. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how you will receive your medication.  Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with phentermine and topiramate and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007428.htm
Answer: A loved one with dementia will need support in the home as the disease gets worse. You can help by trying to understand how the person with dementia perceives his or her world. Give the person a chance to talk about any challenges and take part in his or her own daily care.  Start by talking with your loved one's health care provider. Ask how you can:  - Help the person stay calm and oriented  - Make dressing and grooming easier  - Talk to the person  - Help with memory loss  - Manage behavior and sleep problems   Tips for reducing confusion in people with dementia include:  - Have familiar objects and people around.  - Keep lights on at night.  - Use reminders, notes, lists of routine tasks, or directions for daily activities.  - Stick to a simple activity schedule.    Taking regular walks with a caregiver can help improve communication skills and prevent wandering.  Calming music may reduce wandering and restlessness, ease anxiety, and improve sleep and behavior.  People with dementia should have their eyes and ears checked. If problems are found, hearing aids, glasses, or cataract surgery may be needed.  People with dementia should also have regular driving tests. At some point, it won't be safe for them to continue to drive. This may not be an easy conversation, so seek help from their provider and other family members. State laws vary on the ability of a person with dementia to continue to drive.  Supervised meals can help with feeding. People with dementia often forget to eat and drink, and can become dehydrated as a result. Talk to the provider about the need for extra calories due to increased physical activity from restlessness and wandering.  Also talk to the provider about:  - Watching for risk of choking and what to do if choking occurs  - How to increase safety in the home  - How to prevent falls  - Ways to improve bathroom safety    The Alzheimer's Association's Safe Return Program requires people with dementia to wear an identification bracelet. If they wander, their caregiver can contact the police and the national Safe Return office, where information about them is stored and shared nationwide.  Eventually, people with dementia may need 24-hour monitoring and assistance to provide a safe environment, control aggressive or agitated behavior, and meet their needs.  LONG-TERM CARE  A person with dementia may need monitoring and help at home or in an institution. Possible options include:  - Adult day care  - Boarding homes  - Nursing homes  - In-home care    Many organizations are available to help you care for a person with dementia. They include:  - Adult protective services  - Community resources  - Local or state government departments of aging  - Visiting nurses or aides  - Volunteer services    In some communities, dementia-related support groups may be available. Family counseling can help family members cope with home care.  Advance directives, power of attorney, and other legal actions may make it easier to decide on care for the person with dementia. Seek legal advice early, before the person is unable to make these decisions.  There are support groups that can provide information and resources for people with Alzheimer disease and their caregivers.)

Answer: Acquired hemophilia is a bleeding disorder that interferes with the body's blood clotting process. Although the condition can affect people of all ages, it generally occurs in older people (the median age of diagnosis is between 60 and 67 years). Signs and symptoms include prolonged bleeding, frequent nosebleeds, bruising throughout the body, solid swellings of congealed blood (hematomas), hematuria, and gastrointestinal or urologic bleeding. Acquired hemophilia occurs when the body's immune system attacks and disables a certain protein that helps the blood clot. About half of the cases are associated with other conditions, such as pregnancy, autoimmune disease, cancer, skin diseases, or allergic reactions to medications. Treatment is aimed at controlling bleeding episodes and addressing the underlying cause of the condition.)

URL: https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10247/down-syndrome
Answer: Down syndrome is a chromosome disorder associated with intellectual disability, a characteristic facial appearance, and low muscle tone in infancy. The degree of intellectual disability varies from mild to moderate. People with Down syndrome may also be born with various health concerns such as heart defects or digestive abnormalities. They also have an increased risk to develop gastroesophageal reflux, celiac disease, hypothyroidism, hearing and vision problems, leukemia, and Alzheimer disease. Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of chromosome 21 (called trisomy 21) instead of the usual two copies and is typically not inherited. Treatment focuses on the specific symptoms in each person.)

URL: https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10247/down-syndrome
Answer: What are the signs and symptoms of Down syndrome? People with Down syndrome may develop the following medical problems:  Congenital hypothyroidism Hearing loss Congenital heart defects Seizures Vision disorders Decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) Children with Down syndrome are also more likely to develop chronic respiratory infections, middle ear infections, and recurrent tonsillitis. In addition, there is a higher incidence of pneumonia in children with Down syndrome than in the general population. Children with Down syndrome have developmental delay. They are often slow to turn over, sit, and stand. Developmental delay may be related to the child's weak muscle tone. Development of speech and language may also take longer than expected. Children with Down syndrome may take longer than other children to reach their developmental milestones, but many of these milestones will eventually be met. Adults with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease, a brain disorder that results in a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function. Although Alzheimer disease is usually a disorder that occurs in older adults, about half of adults with Down syndrome develop this condition by age 50. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Down syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Acute megakaryocytic leukemia - Aganglionic megacolon - Anal atresia - Atlantoaxial instability - Brachycephaly - Broad palm - Brushfield spots - Complete atrioventricular canal defect - Conductive hearing impairment - Duodenal stenosis - Epicanthus - Flat face - Hypoplastic iliac wing - Hypothyroidism - Intellectual disability - Joint laxity - Macroglossia - Malar flattening - Microtia - Muscular hypotonia - Myeloproliferative disorder - Protruding tongue - Shallow acetabular fossae - Short middle phalanx of the 5th finger - Short palm - Short stature - Single transverse palmar crease - Sporadic - Thickened nuchal skin fold - Upslanted palpebral fissure - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.)

GARD_0001914_Sec3.txt,"Question: What causes Down syndrome ? (Also called: Trisomy 21; Down's syndrome)
URL: https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10247/down-syndrome
Answer: What causes Down syndrome? There are 3 possible genetic causes of Down syndrome: Trisomy 21. Most often, Down syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome 21 in all cells of the affected person.  In these cases, the chromosome 21 pair fails to separate during the formation of an egg (or sperm); this is called ""nondisjunction."" When the egg with 2 copies of chromosome 21 unites with a normal sperm with one copy of chromosome 21 to form an embryo, the resulting embryo has 3 copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two. The extra chromosome is then copied in every cell of the baby's body, causing the features of Down syndrome. The cause of nondisjunction is unknown, but research has shown that it happens more often as women age. Nondisjunction is not known to be caused by anything in the environment or anything that parents do (or don't do) before or during pregnancy. Mosaic trisomy 21. In about 1-2% of cases, only some of the cells in a person's body have an extra chromosome 21; this is called ""mosaic trisomy 21"".  In this situation, the fertilized egg may have the right number of chromosomes, but due to a cell division error early in the development of the embryo, some cells ""acquire"" an extra chromosome 21. A person with mosaic trisomy 21 typically has 46 chromosomes in some cells, and 47 chromosomes (with the extra chromosome 21) in others. The features and severity in people with mosaic trisomy 21 may vary widely.  Translocation trisomy 21. About 3-4% of people with Down syndrome have cells that contain 46 chromosomes; however, there is extra chromosome 21 material attached (translocated ) onto another chromosome.  For parents of a child with Down syndrome due to a translocation, there may be an increased chance of Down syndrome in future pregnancies. This is because one of the two parents may be a carrier of a balanced translocation. However, not all parents of people with translocation trisomy 21 have a translocation. Regardless of the type of Down syndrome a person has, all people with Down syndrome have an extra, critical portion of chromosome 21 present in all or some of their cells. This extra genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of Down syndrome.)

GHR_0000303_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to Down syndrome ? (Also called: 47,XX,+21; 47,XY,+21; Down's syndrome; trisomy 21; trisomy G)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/down-syndrome
Answer: Most cases of Down syndrome result from trisomy 21, which means each cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two copies.  Less commonly, Down syndrome occurs when part of chromosome 21 becomes attached (translocated) to another chromosome during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) in a parent or very early in fetal development. Affected people have two normal copies of chromosome 21 plus extra material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome, resulting in three copies of genetic material from chromosome 21. Affected individuals with this genetic change are said to have translocation Down syndrome.  A very small percentage of people with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21 in only some of the body's cells. In these people, the condition is called mosaic Down syndrome.  Researchers believe that having extra copies of genes on chromosome 21 disrupts the course of normal development, causing the characteristic features of Down syndrome and the increased risk of health problems associated with this condition.)

GHR_0000303_Sec4.txt,"Question: Is Down syndrome inherited ? (Also called: 47,XX,+21; 47,XY,+21; Down's syndrome; trisomy 21; trisomy G)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/down-syndrome
Answer: Most cases of Down syndrome are not inherited. When the condition is caused by trisomy 21, the chromosomal abnormality occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells in a parent. The abnormality usually occurs in egg cells, but it occasionally occurs in sperm cells. An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of chromosome 21. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra chromosome 21 in each of the body's cells.  People with translocation Down syndrome can inherit the condition from an unaffected parent. The parent carries a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 21 and another chromosome. This rearrangement is called a balanced translocation. No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. However, as this translocation is passed to the next generation, it can become unbalanced. People who inherit an unbalanced translocation involving chromosome 21 may have extra genetic material from chromosome 21, which causes Down syndrome.  Like trisomy 21, mosaic Down syndrome is not inherited. It occurs as a random event during cell division early in fetal development. As a result, some of the body's cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 21, and other cells have three copies of this chromosome.)

GARD_0002450_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Frontotemporal dementia ? (Also called: Dementia, frontotemporal, with parkinsonism; Frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism; Frontotemporal lobe dementia (FLDEM); MSTD; Multiple system tauopathy with presenile dementia; Pick's disease; Primary progressive aphasia; Semantic dementia)
URL: https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/8436/frontotemporal-dementia
Answer: Frontotemporal dementia describes a group of conditions associated with shrinking of the frontal and temporal anterior lobes of the brain. Symptoms include either variable changes in behavior (e.g., impulsive, bored, listless, lack of social contact, lack of empathy, distractibility, blunted emotions, compulsive behavior, decreased energy and motivation) or problems with language (e.g., difficulty making or understanding speech). Spatial skills and memory remain intact. There is a strong genetic component to the disease; it often runs in families. There is no cure for frontotemporal dementia at this time, as a result treatment remains supportive. Although the name and classification of FTD has been a topic of discussion for over a century, the current classification of the syndrome groups together Picks disease, primary progressive aphasia, and semantic dementia as FTD. Some doctors propose adding corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy to FTD and calling the group Pick Complex.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000746.htm
Answer: Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer disease in people over age 65. MID usually affects people between ages 55 and 75. More men than women have vascular dementia.  Vascular dementia is caused by a series of small strokes.  - A stroke is an interruption in or blockage of the blood supply to any part of the brain. A stroke is also called an infarct. Multi-infarct means that more than one area in the brain has been injured due to a lack of blood.  - If blood flow is stopped for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get oxygen. Brain cells can die, causing permanent damage.  - When these strokes affect a small area, there may be no symptoms of a stroke. These are called silent strokes. Over time, as more areas of the brain are damaged, the symptoms of dementia appear.  - Not all strokes are silent. Larger strokes that affect strength, sensation, or other brain and nervous system (neurologic) function can also lead to dementia.    Risk factors for vascular dementia include:  - Diabetes  - Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis)  - High blood pressure (hypertension)  - Smoking  - Stroke   Symptoms of dementia may also be caused by other types of disorders of the brain. One such disorder is Alzheimer disease. Symptoms of Alzheimer disease can be similar to those of vascular dementia. Vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease are the most common causes of dementia, and may occur together.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/alzheimer-disease
Answer: The early-onset form of Alzheimer disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the altered gene from one affected parent.  The inheritance pattern of late-onset Alzheimer disease is uncertain. People who inherit one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing the disease; those who inherit two copies of the allele are at even greater risk. It is important to note that people with the APOE e4 allele inherit an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease, not the disease itself. Not all people with Alzheimer disease have the e4 allele, and not all people who have the e4 allele will develop the disease.)

NINDS_0000098_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Dementia ?
URL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dementias/dementia.htm
Answer: Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness. Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimers disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntingtons disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brains oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems. Although it is common in very elderly individuals, dementia is not a normal part of the aging process.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007660.htm
Answer: During sleep, all of the muscles in the body become more relaxed. This includes the muscles that help keep the throat open so air can flow into the lungs.  Normally, the throat remains open enough during sleep to let air pass by. However, some children have a narrow throat. This is often this is because of large tonsils or adenoids, which partially block the airflow. When the muscles in their upper throat relax during sleep, the tissues close in and block the airway. This stop in breathing is called apnea.  Other factors that also may increase the risk of sleep apnea in children include:  - A small jaw  - Certain shapes of the roof of the mouth (palate)   - Large tongue, which may fall back and block the airway  - Obesity  - Poor muscle tone due to conditions such as Down syndrome or cerebral palsy)

ADAM_0000730_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Central sleep apnea ? (Also called: Sleep apnea - central)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003997.htm
Answer: Central sleep apnea results when the brain temporarily stops sending signals to the muscles that control breathing.   The condition often occurs in people who have certain medical problems. For example, it can develop insomeone who hasa problem with the brainstem, which controls breathing.  Conditions that can cause or lead to central sleep apnea include:  - Problems that affect the brainstem (the brainstem controls breathing) including brain infection, stroke, or conditions of the cervical spine (neck)  - Parkinson disease  - Obesity  - Certain medicines,such as narcotic painkillers  - Heart failure   If the apnea is not associated with another disease, it is called idiopathic central sleep apnea.  A condition called Cheyne-Stokes respiration can mimic central sleep apnea. This involves breathing to a variable depth, usually while sleeping.  Central sleep apnea is not the same as obstructive sleep apnea. With obstructive sleep apnea, breathing stops and starts because the airway is narrowed or blocked. But a person can have both conditions, such as with a medical problem called obesity hypoventilation syndrome.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007660.htm
Answer: Surgery to remove the tonsils and adenoids often cures the condition in children.  If needed, surgery also may be used to:  - Remove extra tissue at the back of the throat  - Correct problems with the structures in the face  - Create an opening in the windpipe to bypass the blocked airway if there are physical problems    Sometimes, surgery is not recommended or does not help. In that case, your child my use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device.  - The child wears a mask over their nose during sleep.  - The mask is connected by a hose to a small machine that sits at the side of the bed.  - The machine pumps air under pressure through the hose and mask and into the airway during sleep. This helps keep the airway open.    It can take some time to get used to sleeping using CPAP therapy. Good follow-up and support from a sleep center can help your child overcome any problems using CPAP.  Other treatments may include:  - Inhaled nasal steroids.  - Dental device. This is inserted into the mouth during sleep to keep the jaw forward and the airway open.  - Weight loss, for overweight children.)

NHLBI_0000118_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Sleep Apnea ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sleepapnea
Answer: Espaol
                
Sleep apnea (AP-ne-ah) is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.
                
Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30times or more an hour. Typically, normal breathing then starts again, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound.
                
Sleep apnea usually is a chronic (ongoing) condition that disrupts your sleep. When your breathing pauses or becomes shallow, youll often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep.
                
As a result, the quality of your sleep is poor, which makes you tired during the day. Sleep apnea is a leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness.
                
Overview
                
Sleep apnea often goes undiagnosed. Doctors usually can't detect the condition during routine office visits. Also, no blood test can help diagnose the condition.
                
Most people who have sleep apnea don't know they have it because it only occurs during sleep. A family member or bed partner might be the first to notice signs of sleep apnea.
                
The most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea. In this condition, the airway collapses or becomes blocked during sleep. This causes shallow breathing or breathing pauses.
                
When you try to breathe, any air that squeezes past the blockage can cause loud snoring. Obstructive sleep apnea is more common in people who are overweight, but it can affect anyone. For example, small children who have enlarged tonsil tissues in their throats may have obstructive sleep apnea.
                
The animation below shows how obstructive sleep apnea occurs. Click the ""start"" button to play the animation. Written and spoken explanations are provided with each frame.

The animation shows how the airway can collapse and block air flow to the lungs, causing sleep apnea.
                
Central sleep apnea is a less common type of sleep apnea. This disorder occurs if the area of your brain that controls your breathing doesn't send the correct signals to your breathing muscles. As a result, you'll make no effort to breathe for brief periods.
                
Central sleep apnea can affect anyone. However, it's more common in people who have certain medical conditions or use certain medicines.
                
Central sleep apnea can occur with obstructive sleep apnea or alone. Snoring typically doesn't happen with central sleep apnea.
                
This article mainly focuses on obstructive sleep apnea.
                
Outlook
                
Untreated sleep apnea can:
                
Increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, obesity, and diabetes
                
Increase the risk of, or worsen, heart failure
                
Make arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), or irregular heartbeats, more likely
                
Increase the chance of having work-related or driving accidents
                
Sleep apnea is a chronic condition that requires long-term management. Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can successfully treat sleep apnea in many people.)

NINDS_0000254_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Sleep Apnea ?
URL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/sleep_apnea/sleep_apnea.htm
Answer: Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by brief interruptions of breathing during sleep. These episodes usually last 10 seconds or more and occur repeatedly throughout the night. People with sleep apnea will partially awaken as they struggle to breathe, but in the morning they will not be aware of the disturbances in their sleep. The most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), caused by relaxation of soft tissue in the back of the throat that blocks the passage of air. Central sleep apnea (CSA) is caused by irregularities in the brains normal signals to breathe. Most people with sleep apnea will have a combination of both types. The hallmark symptom of the disorder is excessive daytime sleepiness. Additional symptoms of sleep apnea include restless sleep, loud snoring (with periods of silence followed by gasps), falling asleep during the day, morning headaches, trouble concentrating, irritability, forgetfulness, mood or behavior changes, anxiety, and depression. Not everyone who has these symptoms will have sleep apnea, but it is recommended that people who are experiencing even a few of these symptoms visit their doctor for evaluation. Sleep apnea is more likely to occur in men than women, and in people who are overweight or obese.)

ADAM_0004167_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) (Also called: Palate surgery; Uvulopalatal flap procedure; UPPP; Laser-assisted uvulopalaplasty; Radiofrequency palatoplasty; Velopharyngeal insufficiency - UPPP; Obstructive sleep apnea - uvulopalaplasty; OSA - uvulopalaplasty)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007663.htm
Answer: Summary : Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is surgery to open the upper airways by taking out extra tissue in the throat. It may be done to treat mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or severe snoring.

Description : Surgery known as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) removes soft tissue at the back of the throat. This includes:  - All or part of the uvula (the soft flap of tissue that hangs down at the back of the mouth).  - Parts of the soft palate and tissue at the sides of the throat.  - Tonsils and adenoids, if they are still there.

Why the Procedure is Performed : Your doctor may recommend this surgery if you have mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  - Try lifestyle changes, such as weight loss or changing your sleep position.  - Most experts recommend trying to use CPAP or an oral device to treat OSA first.    Your doctor may recommend this surgery to treat severe snoring, even if you do not have OSA. Before you decide about this surgery:  - See if weight loss helps your snoring.  - Consider how important it is to you to treat snoring. The surgery does not work for everyone.  - Make sure your insurance will pay for this surgery. If you do not also have OSA, your insurance may not cover the surgery.    Sometimes, UPPP is done along with other more invasive surgeries to treat more severe OSA.

Risks : Risks for any surgery are:  - Allergic reactions to medicines  - Breathing problems  - Heart problems  - Bleeding  - Infection    Risks for this surgery are:  - Damage to the muscles in the throat and soft palate. You may have some problems keeping liquids from coming up through your nose when drinking (called velopharyngeal insufficiency). Most often, this is only a temporary side effect.  - Mucus in the throat  - Speech changes

Before the Procedure : Be sure to tell your doctor or nurse:  - If you are or could be pregnant  - What drugs you are taking, including drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription  - If you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day   During the days before the surgery:  - You may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other drugs that make it hard for your blood to clot.  - Ask your doctor which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery.   On the day of the surgery:  - You will usually be asked not to drink or eat anything for several hours before the surgery.  - Take any drugs your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to arrive at the hospital.

After the Procedure : This surgery most often requires an overnight stay in the hospital to make sure you can swallow. UPPP surgery can be painful and full recovery takes 2 or 3 weeks.  - Your throat will be very sore for up to several weeks. You will get liquid pain medicines to ease the soreness.  - You may have stitches in the back of your throat. These will dissolve or your doctor will remove them at the first follow-up visit.  - Eat only soft foods and liquids for the first 2 weeks after surgery. Avoid crunchy foods or foods that are hard to chew.  - You will need to rinse your mouth after meals with a salt-water solution for the first 7 to 10 days.  - Avoid heavy lifting or straining for the first 2 weeks. You may walk and do light activity after 24 hours.  - You will have a follow-up visit with your doctor 2 or 3 weeks after the surgery.

Outlook (Prognosis) : Sleep apnea improves at first for about half of the people who have this surgery. Over time, the benefit wears off for many people.  Some studies suggest that surgery is best suited only for people with abnormalities in the soft palate.)

ADAM_0000524_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Bowel transit time
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003887.htm
Answer: Summary : Bowel transit time refers to how long it takes for the food to move from the mouth to the end of the intestine (anus).  This article talks about the medical test used to determine bowel transit time.

How the Test is Performed : You will be asked to swallow two gelatin capsules filled with a colored food dye. You take these capsules with a meal.  Afterwards, you observe your bowel movements and write down how long it takes for the colored dye to first appear. You'll also need to note how long it takes for the color to disappear from the stools.

How to Prepare for the Test : In most cases, you do not need to prepare for this test. However, you should follow any diet or other directions from the health care provider.

How the Test will Feel : You will not feel the capsules move through your digestive system.

Why the Test is Performed : The test helps determine bowel function.  Your doctor may ask you to record transit times as you introduce fiber into your diet. Your diet affects the bowel transit time. For example, if you eat a lot of foods rich in fiber (whole grains, vegetables, and fruits), you will have a more rapid transit time and a heavier, bulkier stool.

Normal Results : The bowel transit time varies, even in the same person. The color should first appear in the stool about 12to 14 hours after it is taken. The last of the color will appear within 36to 48 hours.

What Abnormal Results Mean : If the transit time is 72 hours or more, you may have slowed bowel function.

Risks : There are no risks.

Considerations : The bowel transit time dye test is rarely done these days. Instead, bowel transit is often measured with small probes called manometry. Your health care provider can tell you if this is needed for your condition.)

ADAM_0001103_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Day to day with COPD (Also called: COPD - day to day; Chronic obstructive airways disease - day to day; Chronic obstructive lung disease - day to day; Chronic bronchitis - day to day; Emphysema - day to day; Bronchitis - chronic - day to day)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000697.htm
Answer: Summary : Your doctor gave you the news: you have COPD. There is no cure, but there are things you can do every day to keep COPD from getting worse, to protect your lungs, and to stay healthy.

Manage your days : Having COPD can sap your energy. These simple changes can make your days easier and preserve your strength.  - Ask for help when you need it.  - Give yourself more time for daily activities.  - Take breaks to catch your breath when you need to.  - Stay physically and mentally active.  - Set up your house so things you use every day are easily within reach.    Learn how to recognize and manage COPD flare-ups.

Clear the air : Your lungs need clean air. So if you smoke, the best thing you can do for your lungs is quit smoking. Talk with your doctor about ways to quit. Ask about support groups and other stop-smoking strategies.  Even second-hand smoke can cause further damage. So ask other people not to smoke around you.  You should also avoid other forms of pollution like car exhaust and dust. On days when air pollution is high, close the windows and stay inside if you can.

Eat well : Your diet affects COPD in several ways. Food gives you fuel to breathe. Moving air in and out of your lungs takes more work and burns more calories when you have COPD.  Your weight also affects COPD. Being overweight makes it harder to breathe. But if you are too thin, your body will have a hard time fighting illnesses.  Tips for eating well with COPD include:  - Eat small meals and snacks that give you energy, but don't leave you feeling stuffed. Large meals may make it harder for you to breathe.  - Drink water or other liquids throughout the day. Six to eight cups a day is a good goal. Drinking plenty of fluids helps thin mucus so its easier to get rid of it.  - Eat healthy proteins like low-fat milk and cheese, eggs, meat, fish, and nuts.  - Eat healthy fats like olive or canola oils and soft margarine. Ask your doctor how much fat you should eat a day.  - Limit sugary snacks like cakes, cookies, and soda.  - If needed, limit foods like beans, cabbage, and fizzy drinks if they make you feel gassy.    If you need to lose weight:  - Lose weight gradually.  - Replace 3 large meals a day with several smaller meals. That way you wont get too hungry.  - Talk with your doctor about an exercise plan that will help you burn calories.    If you need to gain weight, look for ways to add calories to your meals:  - Add a teaspoon of butter or olive oil to vegetables and soups.  - Stock your kitchen with high-energy snacks like walnuts, almonds, and string cheese.  - Add peanut butter or mayonnaise to your sandwiches.  - Drink milkshakes with high-fat ice cream. Add protein powder for an added boost of calories.

Exercise : Exercise is good for everyone, including people with COPD. Being active can build your strength so you can breathe easier. It can also help you stay healthier for longer.  Talk to your doctor about what kind of exercise is right for you. Then start slow. You may only be able to walk a short distance at first. Over time, you should be able to go longer.  Try to exercise for at least 15 minutes, 3 times a week.  If you become winded, slow down and rest.  Stop exercising and call your doctor if you feel:  - Pain in your chest, neck, arm or jaw  - Sick to your stomach  - Dizzy or lightheaded

Sleep : A good nights sleep can make you feel better and keep you healthier. But when you have COPD, certain things make it harder to get enough rest:  - You might wake up short of breath or coughing.  - Some COPD medicines make it hard to sleep.  - You might have to take a dose of medicine in the middle of the night.    Here are some safe ways to sleep better:  - Let your doctor know you are having trouble sleeping. A change in your treatment might help you sleep.  - Go to bed at the same time every night.  - Do something to relax before you go to bed. You might take a bath or read a book.  - Use window shades to block outside light.  - Ask your family to help keep the house quiet when its time for you to sleep.  - Don't use over-the-counter sleep aids. They can make it harder to breathe.

When to call your doctor : Call your doctor if your breathing is:  - Getting harder  - Faster than before  - Shallow, and you cannot get a deep breath    Also call your doctor if:  - You need to lean forward when sitting in order to breathe easily  - You are using muscles around your ribs to help you breathe  - You are having headaches more often  - You feel sleepy or confused  - You have a fever  - You are coughing up dark mucus  - You are coughing up more mucous than usual  - Your lips, fingertips, or the skin around your fingernails, are blue

ADAM_0003941_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Time out
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002207.htm
Answer: Summary : ""Time out"" is a technique some parents and teachers use when a child misbehaves. It involves the child leaving the environment and activities where the inappropriate behavior occurred, and going to a specific place for a set amount of time. During time out, the child is expected to be quiet and think about their behavior.  Time out is an effective disciplinary technique that does not use physical punishment. Professionals report that NOT physically punishing children may help them learn that physical violence or inflicting physical pain does NOT bring desired results.  Children learn to avoid time out by stopping the behaviors that have caused time outs, or warnings of time outs, in the past.

Information : HOW TO USE TIME OUT  - Find a place in your home that will be suitable for time out. A chair in the hallway or a corner will work. It should be a place that is not too closed-off, dark, or scary. It should also be a place that has no potential for fun, such as in front of a TV or in a play area.  - Get a timer that makes a loud noise, and establish the amount of time to be spent in time out. It is generally recommended to do 1 minute per year of age, but no more than 5 minutes.  - Once your child shows bad behavior, explain clearly what the unacceptable behavior is, and tell your child to stop it. Warn them what will happen if they don't stop the behavior -- sitting in the chair for a time out. Be ready with praise if your child stops the behavior.  - If the behavior does not stop, tell your child to go to time out. Tell them why -- make sure they understand the rules. Only say it once, and do not lose your temper. By yelling and nagging, you are giving your child (and the behavior) too much attention. You may guide your child to the time out spot with as much physical force as necessary (even picking your child up and placing them in the chair). Never spank or physically hurt your child. If your child will not stay in the chair, hold them from behind. Do not speak, as this is giving them attention.  - Set the timer. If your child makes noise or misbehaves, reset the timer. If they get off the time-out chair, lead them back to the chair and reset the timer. The child must be quiet and well-behaved until the timer goes off.  - After the timer rings, your child may get up and resume activities. Do not hold a grudge -- let the issue go. Since your child has done the time out, there is no need to continue to discuss the bad behavior.)

GHR_0000637_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ? (Also called: ACADM deficiency; MCAD deficiency; MCADD; MCADH deficiency; medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency; medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/medium-chain-acyl-coa-dehydrogenase-deficiency
Answer: Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is a condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy, particularly during periods without food (fasting).  Signs and symptoms of MCAD deficiency typically appear during infancy or early childhood and can include vomiting, lack of energy (lethargy), and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). In rare cases, symptoms of this disorder are not recognized early in life, and the condition is not diagnosed until adulthood. People with MCAD deficiency are at risk of serious complications such as seizures, breathing difficulties, liver problems, brain damage, coma, and sudden death.  Problems related to MCAD deficiency can be triggered by periods of fasting or by illnesses such as viral infections. This disorder is sometimes mistaken for Reye syndrome, a severe disorder that may develop in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/medium-chain-acyl-coa-dehydrogenase-deficiency
Answer: Mutations in the ACADM gene cause MCAD deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which is required to break down (metabolize) a group of fats called medium-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids are found in foods and the body's fat tissues. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods of fasting, fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.  Mutations in the ACADM gene lead to a shortage (deficiency) of the MCAD enzyme within cells. Without sufficient amounts of this enzyme, medium-chain fatty acids are not metabolized properly. As a result, these fats are not converted to energy, which can lead to the characteristic signs and symptoms of this disorder such as lethargy and hypoglycemia. Medium-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may also build up in tissues and damage the liver and brain. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of MCAD deficiency.)

Answer: This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.

Answer: Summary : A bowel movement is the last stop in the movement of food through your digestive tract. Your stool passes out of your body through the rectum and anus. Another name for stool is feces. It is made of what is left after your digestive system (stomach, small intestine, and colon) absorbs nutrients and fluids from what you eat and drink.    Sometimes a bowel movement isn't normal. Diarrhea happens when stool passes through the large intestine too quickly. Constipation occurs when stool passes through the large intestine too slowly.

Answer: The most common cause of diarrhea is the stomach flu (viral gastroenteritis). This mild viral infection goes away on its own within a few days.  Eating or drinking food or water that contains certain types of bacteria or parasites can also lead to diarrhea. This problem may be called food poisoning.  Certain medicines may also cause diarrhea, including:  - Some antibiotics  - Chemotherapy drugs for cancer  - Laxatives containing magnesium    Diarrhea may also be caused by medical disorders, such as:  - Celiac disease  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis)  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  - Lactose intolerance (which causes problems after drinking milk and eating other dairy products)  - Malabsorption syndromes   Less common causes of diarrhea include:  - Carcinoid syndrome  - Disorders of the nerves that supply the intestines  - Removal of part of the stomach (gastrectomy) or small intestine  - Radiation therapy    People who travel to third-world or developing countries can get diarrhea from unclean water or food that isn't handled safely.

Answer: Your doctor will perform a physical exam and ask you questions about your medical history and symptoms.  Lab tests may be done on your stools to determine the cause of your diarrhea.   This is also a good time to ask your doctor any questions you have about diarrhea.  Over-the-counter supplements that contain healthy bacteria may help prevent diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics. These are called probiotics. Yogurt with active or live cultures is also a good source of these healthy bacteria.  The following healthy steps can help you prevent illnesses that cause diarrhea:  - Wash your hands often, especially after going to the bathroom and before eating.  - Use alcohol-based hand gel frequently.  - Teach children to not put objects in their mouth.  - Take steps to avoid food poisoning.   When traveling to underdeveloped areas, follow the steps below to avoid diarrhea:  - Drink only bottled water and do not use ice, unless it is made from bottled or purified water.  - Do NOT eat uncooked vegetables or fruits that do not have peels.  - Do NOT eat raw shellfish or undercooked meat.  - Do NOT consume dairy products.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002118.htm
Answer: Children who have diarrhea may have less energy, dry eyes, or a dry, sticky mouth. They may also not wet their diaper as often as usual.  Give your child fluids for the first 4 to 6 hours. At first, try 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) of fluid every 30 to 60 minutes. You can use:  - An over-the-counter drink, such as Pedialyte or Infalyte -- do not water down these drinks  - Pedialyte frozen fruit pops   If you are nursing, keep breastfeeding your infant. If you are using formula, use it at half strength for 2 to 3 feedings after the diarrhea starts. Then begin regular formula feedings again.  If your child throws up, give only a little bit of fluid at a time. You can start with as little as 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of fluid every 10 to 15 minutes.  When your child is ready for regular foods, try:  - Bananas  - Chicken  - Crackers  - Pasta  - Rice cereal   Avoid:  - Apple juice  - Dairy  - Fried foods  - Full-strength fruit juice   The BRAT diet was recommended by somehealth care providersin the past. There is not a lot of evidence that it is better than a standard diet for upset stomach, but it probably can't hurt.

URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/diarrhea/Pages/diarrhea-in-children-facts.aspx
Answer: Diarrhea is loose, watery stools. Chronic, or long lasting, diarrhea typically lasts for more than 4 weeks. Children with chronic diarrhea may have loose, watery stools continually, or diarrhea may come and go. Chronic diarrhea may go away without treatment, or it may be a symptom of a chronic disease or disorder. Treating the disease or disorder can relieve chronic diarrhea.
                
Chronic diarrhea can affect children of any age:
                
- infantsages 0 to 12 months  - toddlersages 1 to 3 years  - preschool-age childrenages 3 to 5 years  - grade school-age childrenages 5 to 12 years  - adolescentsages 12 to 18 years
                
Diarrhea that lasts only a short time is called acute diarrhea. Acute diarrhea, a common problem, usually lasts a few days and goes away on its own. More information about acute diarrhea is provided in the NIDDK health topics:

NIDDK_0000089_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Chronic Diarrhea in Children ?
URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/diarrhea/Pages/diarrhea-in-children-facts.aspx
Answer: Many diseases and disorders can cause chronic diarrhea in children. Common causes include
                
- infections  - functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders  - food allergies and intolerances  - inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
                
Infections, food allergies and intolerances, and IBD may cause chronic diarrhea along with malabsorption, meaning the small intestine does not absorb nutrients from food. If children do not absorb enough nutrients from the food they eat, they may become malnourished. Functional GI disorders do not cause malabsorption.
                
Infections
                
Infections from viruses, bacteria, or parasites sometimes lead to chronic diarrhea. After an infection, some children have problems digesting carbohydrates, such as lactose, or proteins, such as milk or soy proteins. These problems can cause prolonged diarrheaoften for up to 6 weeksafter an infection. Also, some bacteria and parasite infections that cause diarrhea do not go away quickly without treatment.
                
More information about infections that cause diarrhea is provided in the NIDDK health topics:
                
- Viral Gastroenteritis  - Foodborne Illnesses
                
Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth may also cause chronic diarrhea. Normally, few bacteria live in the small intestine, and many bacteria live in the large intestine. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in the small intestine. These bacteria can cause diarrhea, gas, cramping, and weight loss. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is often related to diseases or disorders that damage the digestive system or affect how it works, such as Crohns disease or diabetes. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is also more common in people who have had abdominal surgery or who have slow-moving intestines.
                
Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders
                
In functional GI disorders, symptoms are caused by changes in how the GI tract works. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anusthe opening through which stool leaves the body. The GI tract digests, or breaks down, food and processes solid waste.
                
Children with a functional GI disorder have frequent symptoms, yet the GI tract does not become damaged. Functional GI disorders are not diseases; they are groups of symptoms that occur together.
                
Two functional GI disorders that cause chronic diarrhea in children are toddlers diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
                
Toddlers diarrhea. Toddlers diarrheaalso called functional diarrhea or chronic nonspecific diarrhea of childhoodis a common cause of chronic diarrhea in toddlers and preschool-age children. Children with this disorder pass three or more loose stools a day and do not have any other symptoms. They typically are growing well and gaining weight, and are healthy.
                
Toddlers diarrhea develops between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, and it usually goes away on its own by the time children begin grade school. Researchers think a diet with too much sugarsuch as the sugar found in fruit juicerelative to the amount of fat and fiber may cause toddlers diarrhea.
                
IBS. The most common symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea. The pain or discomfort of IBS typically gets better with the passage of stool or gas. IBS does not cause symptoms such as weight loss, vomiting, or blood in the stool.
                
Possible causes include problems with nerves in the intestines, problems with nerve signals between the brain and the intestines, changes in how food moves through the intestines, and hypersensitivity to pain. Psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression, or food sensitivity may also play a role.
                
IBS is a common cause of chronic diarrhea in grade school-age children and adolescents. Health care providers rarely diagnose IBS in younger children because younger children are not able to report symptoms of pain or discomfort. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topics:
                
- Irritable Bowel Syndrome  - Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Children
                
Food Allergies and Intolerances
                
Food allergies, celiac disease, lactose intolerance, and dietary fructose intolerance are common causes of chronic diarrhea.
                
Food allergies. A food allergy is a reaction by the immune system, the bodys natural defense system, to one or more proteins in certain foods. The immune system normally protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances that can cause illness. In food allergies, however, the immune system responds abnormally to certain foods.
                
Cows milk and soy allergies are the most common food allergies that affect the GI tract in children. Food allergies usually appear in the first year of life. Many children outgrow cows milk and soy allergies by age 3. Allergies to other foods, such as cereal grains, eggs, or seafood, may also affect the GI tract.
                
Symptoms of food allergies may include diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss or poor weight gain. Some children have mild symptoms, while others have severe or life-threatening symptoms. For example, some children have severe vomiting and diarrhea that lead to dehydration, which means the body lacks enough fluid and electrolytesminerals in salts, including sodium, potassium, and chlorideto function properly.
                
Celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease in which people cannot tolerate gluten. A chronic reaction to gluten damages the lining of their small intestine and prevents absorption of nutrients. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley and in vitamin and nutrient supplements, lip balms, communion wafers, and certain medications.
                
Children of any age can experience digestive symptoms of celiac disease or have symptoms in other parts of the body. Digestive symptoms can include
                
- chronic diarrhea  - abdominal bloating  - stomach pain  - gas  - vomiting  - constipation  - pale, foul-smelling, or fatty stool
                
Malabsorption of nutrients during the years when nutrition is critical to a childs normal growth and development can result in other health problems. These problems may include
                
- failure to thrive in infants  - slowed growth and short stature  - weight loss  - irritability or mood changes  - delayed puberty  - dental enamel defects of the permanent teeth  - anemia, a condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which prevents the bodys cells from getting enough oxygen  - low levels of important nutrients such as iron and calcium
                
More information is provided in the NIDDK health topics:
                
- Celiac Disease  - What I need to know about Celiac Disease
                
Lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance is a condition in which people have digestive symptomssuch as bloating, gas, and diarrheaafter consuming milk or milk products. Lactose is a sugar found in milk or milk products. Lactase, an enzyme produced by the small intestine, breaks down lactose into two simpler forms of sugar: glucose and galactose. The bloodstream then absorbs these simpler sugars.
                
Some children have a lactase deficiency, meaning the small intestine produces low levels of lactase and cannot digest much lactose. Lactase deficiency may cause lactose malabsorption. In children with lactose malabsorption, undigested lactose passes to the colon, where bacteria break down the lactose and create fluid and gas.
                
Not all children with lactase deficiency and lactose malabsorption have digestive symptoms. Experts use the term lactose intolerance when lactase deficiency and lactose malabsorption cause digestive symptoms.
                
The most common type of lactase deficiency develops over time, beginning after about age 2, when the body begins to produce less lactase. Children who have lactase deficiency may not experience symptoms of lactose intolerance until late adolescence or adulthood.
                
Infants rarely have lactose intolerance at birth. People sometimes mistake cows milk allergy, which can cause diarrhea in infants, for lactose intolerance. Congenital lactase deficiencyan extremely rare inherited genetic disorder in which the small intestine produces little or no lactase enzyme at birthcan cause lactose intolerance in infants. Premature infants may experience lactose intolerance for a short time after birth. Children of any age may develop temporary lactose intolerance after a viral diarrheal episode or other infection.

- Lactose Intolerance  - What I need to know about Lactose Intolerance
                
Dietary fructose intolerance. Dietary fructose intolerance is a condition in which people have digestive symptomssuch as bloating, gas, and diarrheaafter consuming foods that contain fructose. Fructose is a sugar found in fruits, fruit juices, and honey. Fructose is also added to many foods and soft drinks as a sweetener called high fructose corn syrup.
                
Fructose malabsorption causes dietary fructose intolerance. The small intestine absorbs fructose, and, when a person consumes more fructose than the small intestine can absorb, fructose malabsorption results. Unabsorbed fructose passes to the colon, where bacteria break down the fructose and create fluid and gas.
                
The amount of fructose that a childs small intestine can absorb varies. The capacity of the small intestine to absorb fructose increases with age. Some children may be able to tolerate more fructose as they get older.
                
Another type of fructose intolerance, hereditary fructose intolerance, is not related to fructose malabsorption. Hereditary fructose intolerance is an extremely rare inherited genetic disorder. Children with this disorder lack an enzyme needed to break down fructose. Symptoms of hereditary fructose intolerance may include abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. This disorder can also damage the liver and kidneys.
                
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
                
Inflammatory bowel disease causes irritation and inflammation in the intestines. The two main types of IBD are ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease. These disorders can affect children at any age; however, they commonly begin in the grade school years or in adolescence. The causes of IBD are unknown. Researchers believe they result from an abnormal immune system reaction.
                
Ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis is a disease that causes inflammation, or swelling, and ulcers in the inner lining of the large intestine. The large intestine includes the colon and the rectumthe lower end of the large intestine leading to the anus. Normally, the large intestine absorbs water from stool and changes it from a liquid to a solid. In ulcerative colitis, the inflammation causes loss of the lining of the large intestine, leading to bleeding, production of pus, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort.
                
More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Ulcerative Colitis.
                
Crohns disease. Crohns disease is a disease that causes inflammation and irritation of any part of the GI tract. The end part of the small intestine, called the ileum, is most commonly affected. In Crohns disease, inflammation can extend through the entire wall of the GI tract, leading to possible complications. Swelling can cause pain and can make the intestine empty frequently, resulting in diarrhea.

NIDDK_0000089_Sec4.txt,"Question: What causes Chronic Diarrhea in Children ?
URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/diarrhea/Pages/diarrhea-in-children-facts.aspx
Answer: To determine the cause of chronic diarrhea in children, the health care provider will take a complete medical and family history and conduct a physical exam, and may perform tests.
                
Medical and family history. Taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help determine the cause of chronic diarrhea. He or she will ask for information about symptoms, such as
                
- how long the child has had diarrhea  - the amount of stool passed  - the frequency of diarrhea  - the appearance of the stool  - the presence of other symptoms that accompany diarrhea
                
The health care provider will ask about the childs diet and may recommend keeping a diary of the childs diet and bowel habits. If the health care provider suspects a food allergy or intolerance, he or she may recommend changing the childs diet to see if symptoms improve.
                
The health care provider may also ask about family medical history. Some of the conditions that cause chronic diarrhea, such as celiac disease and lactose intolerance, run in families.
                
Physical exam. After taking a medical history, a health care provider will perform a physical exam, which may help determine the cause of chronic diarrhea. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually
                
- examines a childs body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to bodily sounds  - taps on specific areas of the childs body
                
Tests. The health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests:
                
- Stool test. A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the parent or caretaker a container for catching and storing the stool. The parent or caretaker returns the sample to the health care provider or a commercial facility that will send the sample to a lab for analysis. Stool tests can show the presence of blood, bacteria, or parasites or signs of diseases and disorders. The health care provider may also do a rectal exam, sometimes during the physical exam. For a rectal exam, the health care provider inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to check for blood in the stool.    - Blood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can show signs of certain diseases and disorders that can cause chronic diarrhea in children, including      - high levels of white blood cells, which may be a sign of inflammation or infection somewhere in the body    - anemia, which may be a sign of bleeding in the GI tract or of malabsorption    - the presence of certain antibodiesproteins that react against the bodys own cells or tissueswhich may be a sign of celiac disease      - Hydrogen breath test. This test measures the amount of hydrogen in a childs breath. Normally, only a small amount of hydrogen is detectable in the breath. However, bacteria break down sugarssuch as lactose and fructosethat are not digested by the small intestine and produce high levels of hydrogen. In small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, bacteria break down sugars in the small intestine and produce hydrogen.  For this test, the child breathes into a balloonlike container that measures hydrogen. Then, the child drinks a lactose-loaded beverage, and the childs breath is analyzed at regular intervals to measure the amount of hydrogen. In most cases, a health care provider performs this test at a hospital, on an outpatient basis. A health care provider may use a hydrogen breath test to check for signs of lactose intolerance, fructose intolerance, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.    - Upper GI endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A child may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. A health care provider will place an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given.  The health care provider may use instruments passed through the endoscope to perform a biopsy or collect fluid. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue for examination with a microscope. A pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the tissues in a lab. This test can show problems in the upper GI tract that may cause chronic diarrhea. For example, a biopsy of the small intestine can show signs of celiac disease. A health care provider may use a fluid sample from the small intestine to check for bacteria to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.    - Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. While these tests are similar, a health care provider uses a colonoscopy to view the rectum and entire colon and a flexible sigmoidoscopy to view just the rectum and lower colon. A gastroenterologist performs these tests at a hospital or an outpatient center. For both tests, the health care provider will give written bowel prep instructions for the child to follow at home. The health care provider may ask that the child follow a clear liquid diet the day before either test. The child may require a laxative for 4 days before either test or only the day before either test. The child may require an enema the day before either test. These medications cause diarrhea, so the child should stay close to a bathroom during the bowel prep.  In most cases, light anesthesia, and possibly pain medication, helps the child relax. For either test, the child will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the anus. A small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. The gastroenterologist may also perform a biopsy by taking a small piece of tissue from the intestinal lining. The child will not feel the biopsy. These tests can show problems in the rectum or colon, such as signs of IBD.  Cramping or bloating may occur during the first hour after these tests. The child should recover fully by the next day and be able to return to a normal diet.)

URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/diarrhea/Pages/diarrhea-in-children-facts.aspx
Answer: The treatment for chronic diarrhea will depend on the cause. Some common causes of chronic diarrhea are treated as follows:
                
- Infections. If a child has prolonged problems digesting certain carbohydrates or proteins after an acute infection, a health care provider may recommend changes in diet. A child may need antibiotics or medications that target parasites to treat infections that do not go away on their own. A health care provider may also prescribe antibiotics to treat small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.    - Functional GI disorders. For toddlers diarrhea, treatment is usually not needed. Most children outgrow toddlers diarrhea by the time they start school. In many children, limiting fruit juice intake and increasing the amount of fiber and fat in the diet may improve symptoms of toddlers diarrhea.  A health care provider may treat IBS with      - changes in diet.    - medication.    - probioticslive microorganisms, usually bacteria, that are similar to microorganisms normally found in the GI tract. Studies have found that probiotics, specifically Bifidobacteria and certain probiotic combinations, improve symptoms of IBS when taken in large enough amounts. However, researchers are still studying the use of probiotics to treat IBS.    - psychological therapy.
                
To help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of complementary and alternative medical practices, including their use of dietary supplements and probiotics, with their health care provider. Read more at www.nccam.nih.gov/health/probiotics.
                

                
- Food allergies and intolerances. A health care provider will recommend changes in diet to manage symptoms of food allergies and intolerances. To treat food allergies, the childs parent or caretaker should remove the food that triggers the allergy from the childs diet.  For children with celiac disease, following a gluten-free diet will stop symptoms, heal existing intestinal damage, and prevent further damage.  The childs parent or caretaker can manage the symptoms of lactose intolerance with changes in the childs diet and by using products that contain the lactase enzyme. Most children with lactose intolerance can tolerate some amount of lactose in their diet. The amount of change needed in the diet depends on how much lactose a child can consume without symptoms.  For children with dietary fructose intolerance, reducing the amount of fructose in the diet can relieve symptoms.    - IBD. A health care provider may use medications, surgery, and changes in diet to treat IBD.)

GHR_0000087_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) autoimmune Addison disease ? (Also called: autoimmune Addison's disease; autoimmune adrenalitis; classic Addison disease; primary Addison disease)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/autoimmune-addison-disease
Answer: Autoimmune Addison disease affects the function of the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. It is classified as an autoimmune disorder because it results from a malfunctioning immune system that attacks the adrenal glands. As a result, the production of several hormones is disrupted, which affects many body systems.  The signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease can begin at any time, although they most commonly begin between ages 30 and 50. Common features of this condition include extreme tiredness (fatigue), nausea, decreased appetite, and weight loss. In addition, many affected individuals have low blood pressure (hypotension), which can lead to dizziness when standing up quickly; muscle cramps; and a craving for salty foods. A characteristic feature of autoimmune Addison disease is abnormally dark areas of skin (hyperpigmentation), especially in regions that experience a lot of friction, such as the armpits, elbows, knuckles, and palm creases. The lips and the inside lining of the mouth can also be unusually dark. Because of an imbalance of hormones involved in development of sexual characteristics, women with this condition may lose their underarm and pubic hair.  Other signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease include low levels of sugar (hypoglycemia) and sodium (hyponatremia) and high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia) in the blood. Affected individuals may also have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and an increase in the number of white blood cells (lymphocytosis), particularly those known as eosinophils (eosinophilia).  Autoimmune Addison disease can lead to a life-threatening adrenal crisis, characterized by vomiting, abdominal pain, back or leg cramps, and severe hypotension leading to shock. The adrenal crisis is often triggered by a stressor, such as surgery, trauma, or infection.  Individuals with autoimmune Addison disease or their family members often have another autoimmune disorder, most commonly autoimmune thyroid disease or type 1 diabetes.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/autoimmune-addison-disease
Answer: The cause of autoimmune Addison disease is complex and not completely understood. A combination of environmental and genetic factors plays a role in the disorder, and changes in multiple genes are thought to affect the risk of developing the condition.  The genes that have been associated with autoimmune Addison disease participate in the body's immune response. The most commonly associated genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. The most well-known risk factor for autoimmune Addison disease is a variant of the HLA-DRB1 gene called HLA-DRB1*04:04. This and other disease-associated HLA gene variants likely contribute to an inappropriate immune response that leads to autoimmune Addison disease, although the mechanism is unknown.  Normally, the immune system responds only to proteins made by foreign invaders, not to the body's own proteins. In autoimmune Addison disease, however, an immune response is triggered by a normal adrenal gland protein, typically a protein called 21-hydroxylase. This protein plays a key role in producing certain hormones in the adrenal glands. The prolonged immune attack triggered by 21-hydroxylase damages the adrenal glands (specifically the outer layers of the glands known, collectively, as the adrenal cortex), preventing hormone production. A shortage of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency) disrupts several normal functions in the body, leading to hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypotension, muscle cramps, skin hyperpigmentation and other features of autoimmune Addison disease.  Rarely, Addison disease is not caused by an autoimmune reaction. Other causes include infections that damage the adrenal glands, such as tuberculosis, or tumors in the adrenal glands. Addison disease can also be one of several features of other genetic conditions, including X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and autoimmune polyglandular syndrome, type 1, which are caused by mutations in other genes.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/autoimmunediseases.html
Answer: Your body's immune system protects you from disease and infection. But if you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Autoimmune diseases can affect many parts of the body.    No one is sure what causes autoimmune diseases. They do tend to run in families. Women - particularly African-American, Hispanic-American, and Native-American women - have a higher risk for some autoimmune diseases.    There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases, and some have similar symptoms. This makes it hard for your health care provider to know if you really have one of these diseases, and if so, which one. Getting a diagnosis can be frustrating and stressful. Often, the first symptoms are fatigue, muscle aches and a low fever. The classic sign of an autoimmune disease is inflammation, which can cause redness, heat, pain and swelling.    The diseases may also have flare-ups, when they get worse, and remissions, when symptoms get better or disappear. Treatment depends on the disease, but in most cases one important goal is to reduce inflammation. Sometimes doctors prescribe corticosteroids or other drugs that reduce your immune response.)

Answer: Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. It can also be caused byinfection or exposure to toxins. In many cases, the cause is unknown.  The most common form of uveitis is anterior uveitis. This involves inflammation in the front part of the eye. It is often called iritis because it usually only affects the iris, the colored part of the eye. The inflammation may be linked with autoimmune diseases, but most cases occur in healthy people. The disorder may affect only one eye. It is most common in young and middle-aged people.  Posterior uveitis affects the back part of the uvea. It involves primarily the choroid, which is a layer of blood vessels and connective tissue in the middle part of the eye. This type of uveitis is called choroiditis. If the retina is also involved, it is called chorioretinitis. You may develop this condition if you have had a body-wide (systemic) infection or if you have an autoimmune disease.  Another form of uveitis is pars planitis. This inflammation affects the narrowed area (pars plana) between the colored part of the eye (iris) and the choroid. Pars planitis most often occurs in young men. It is generally not associated with any other disease. However, it may be linked to Crohn's disease and possibly multiple sclerosis.  Uveitis can be associated with any of the following:  - AIDS  - Ankylosing spondylitis  - Behcet syndrome  - CMV retinitis  - Herpes zoster infection  - Histoplasmosis  - Injury  - Kawasaki disease  - Psoriasis  - Reactive arthritis  - Rheumatoid arthritis  - Sarcoidosis  - Syphilis  - Toxoplasmosis  - Tuberculosis  - Ulcerative colitis)

ADAM_0000464_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Bladder biopsy (Also called: Biopsy - bladder)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003902.htm
Answer: Summary : Bladder biopsy is a procedure that involves removing a small piece of tissue from the bladder. The tissue is examined under a microscope.

How the Test is Performed : A bladder biopsy can be done as part of a cystoscopy (telescopic examination of the inside of the bladder). A small piece of tissue or the entire abnormal area is removed and sent to the lab to be tested if:  - Abnormalities of the bladder are found during this exam  - A tumor is seen

How to Prepare for the Test : You must sign an informed consent form before you have a bladder biopsy. In most cases, you are asked to urinate just before the procedure. You may also be asked to take an antibiotic before the procedure.  For infants and children, the preparation you can provide for this test depends on your child's age, previous experiences, and level of trust. For general information regarding how you can prepare your child, see the following topics:  - Infant test or procedure preparation (birth to 1 year)  - Toddler test or procedure preparation (1 to 3 years)  - Preschooler test or procedure preparation (3 to 6 years)  - School age test or procedure preparation (6 to 12 years)  - Adolescent test or procedure preparation (12 to 18 years)

How the Test will Feel : There may be slight discomfort as the cystoscope (a lighted instrument used to look at the bladder) is passed through your urethra into your bladder. You will feel discomfort that is similar to a strong urge to urinate when the fluid has filled your bladder.  You may feel a pinch during the biopsy. There may be a burning sensation when the blood vessels are sealed to stop bleeding (cauterized).  After the cystoscope is removed, your urethra may be sore. You may feel a burning sensation during urination for a day or two.  If the biopsy needs to be taken from a large area, you may need general or spinal anesthesia before the procedure.

Why the Test is Performed : This test is most often done to check for cancer of the bladder or urethra.

Normal Results : The bladder wall is smooth. The bladder is of a normal size, shape, and position. There are no blockages, growths, or stones.

What Abnormal Results Mean : The presence of cancer cells indicates bladder cancer. The type of cancer can be determined from the biopsy sample.  Other abnormalities may include:  - Bladder diverticula  - Cysts  - Infection  - Ulcers

Risks : There is some risk of urinary tract infection.  There is a slight risk of excessive bleeding or rupturing of the bladder wall with the cystoscope or during biopsy.  There is also a risk that the biopsy will fail to diagnose a serious condition.

Considerations : You will likely have a small amount of blood in your urine shortly after this procedure. If the bleeding continues after you urinate, contact your health care provider.  Also contact your health care provider if:  - You have pain, chills, or a fever.  - You are producing less urine than usual (oliguria).  - You cannot urinate despite a strong urge to do so.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002997.htm
Answer: Bladder exstrophy repair involves two surgeries. The first surgery is to repair the bladder and the second one is to attach the pelvic bones to each other.  The first surgery separates the exposed bladder from the abdomen wall and closes the bladder. The bladder neck and urethra are repaired. A flexible, hollow tube called a catheter is placed to drain urine from the bladder through the abdominal wall. A second catheter is left in the urethra to promote healing.  The second surgery, pelvic bone surgery, may be done along with the bladder repair, or it may be delayed for weeks or months.  A third surgery may be needed if there is a bowel defect.)

Answer: Breath holding spells most often occur when a child becomes suddenly upset or surprised. The child makes a short gasp, exhales, and stops breathing. The child's nervous system slows the heart rate or breathing for a short amount of time. Breath holding spells are not thought to be a willful act of defiance, even though they often occur with temper tantrums. Symptoms can include:  - Blue or pale skin  - Crying, then no breathing  - Fainting or loss of alertness (unconsciousness)  - Jerky movements (short, seizure-like movements)    Normal breathing starts again after a brief period of unconsciousness.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003619.htm
Answer: Summary : This type of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test measures the specific level of HCG in the urine. HCG is a hormone produced in the body during pregnancy.  Other HCG tests include:  - HCG in blood serum - qualitative  - HCG in blood serum - quantitative  - Pregnancy test

How the Test is Performed : To collect a urine sample, you urinate into a special (sterile) cup. Home pregnancy tests require the test strip to be dipped into the urine sample or passed through the urine stream while urinating. Carefully follow package directions.  Usually a urine sample taken the first time you urinate in the morning is best. This is when urine is the most concentrated and has enough HCG to be detected.

How to Prepare for the Test : No special preparation is needed.

How the Test will Feel : The test involves urinating into a cup or onto a test strip.

Why the Test is Performed : Urine HCG tests are a common method of determining if a woman is pregnant. The best time to test for pregnancy at home is after you miss your period.

Normal Results : - The test is negative if you are not pregnant.  - The test is positive if you are pregnant.    A pregnancy test, including a properly performed home pregnancy test, is considered to be very accurate. Positive results are more likely to be accurate than negative results. When the test is negative but pregnancy is still suspected, the test should be repeated in 1 week.

Risks : There are no risks, except for false positive or false negative results.)

Answer: Transplantation is a procedure that is done to replace one of your organs with a healthy one from someone else. The surgery is only one part of a complex, long-term process.  Several experts will help you prepare for the procedure, and make sure you are comfortable before, during, and after surgery.) 
"
ADAM_0004013_Sec2.txt,"Question: What is (are) Transplant services ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007457.htm
Answer: Transplant surgery is typically done to replace a diseased body part with a healthy one.  SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANTS  - Auto islet cell transplant is done after a person has their pancreas removed due to chronic pancreatitis. The procedure takes insulin-producing cells from the pancreas and returns them to the patient's body.  - Corneal transplant replaces a damaged or diseased cornea. The cornea is the clear tissue on the front of the eye that helps focus light on the retina. It is the part of the eye on which a contact lens rests.  - Heart transplant is an option for someone with congestive heart failure that has not responded to medical treatment.  - Intestinal transplant is an option for patients with short bowel or short gut syndrome or advanced liver disease, or who must receive all nutrients through a feeding line. See: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)  - Kidney transplant is an option for someone with chronic kidney failure. It may be donewith a kidney-pancreas transplant.  - Liver transplant may be the only option for someone with liver disease that has led to liver failure.  - Lung transplant may replace one or both lungs. It may be the only option for someone with lung disease who has not gotten better using other medicines and therapies, and is expected to survive for less than 2 years.    BLOOD/BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS (STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS)  You may need a stem cell transplant if you have a disease that damages the cells in bone marrow, or if you received high doses of chemotherapy or radiation.  Depending on the type of transplant, your procedure may be called a bone marrow transplant, a cord blood transplant, or a peripheral blood stem cell transplant. All three use stem cells, which are immature cells that give rise to all blood cells. Stem cell transplants are similar to blood transfusions and generally do not need surgery.  There are two different types of transplants:  - Autologous transplants use your own blood cells or bone marrow.  - Allogeneic transplants use a donor's blood cells or bone marrow. A syngeneic allogenic transplant uses cells or bone marrow from the patient's identical twin.    For more information, see: Bone marrow transplant  THE TRANSPLANT SERVICES TEAM  The transplant services team includes carefully selected experts, including:  - Surgeons who specialize in performing organ transplants  - Medical doctors  - Radiologists and medical imaging technologists  - Nurses  - Infectious disease experts  - Physical therapists  - Psychiatrists, psychologists, and other counselors  - Social workers  - Nutritionists and dietitians    BEFORE A TRANSPLANT  You will have a complete medical exam to identify and treat all medical problems, such as kidney and heart disease.  The transplant team will evaluate you and review your medical history to determine if you meet the criteria for organ transplantation. Most types of organ transplants have guidelines detailing what type of patient is most likely to benefit from a transplant and will be able to manage the challenging process.  If the transplant team believes you are a good candidate for a transplant, you will be put on a national waiting list. Your place on a waiting list is based on a number of factors, which depend on the type of transplant you are receiving.   Once you are on the waiting list, the search for a matching donor begins. Types of donors depend on your specific transplant, but include:  - A living related donor is related to you, such as a parent, sibling, or child.  - A living unrelated donor is a person, such as a friend or spouse.  - A deceased donor is someone who has recently died. The heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, intestines, and pancreas can be recovered from an organ donor.    After donating an organ, living donors can live a normal, healthy life.   You should identify family, friends, or other caregivers who can offer help and support during and after the transplant process.  You will also want to prepare your home to make it comfortable for when you return after being released from the hospital.  AFTER A TRANSPLANT  How long you stay in the hospital depends on the type of transplant that you have. During your time in the hospital, you will be seen daily by the transplant services team.  Your transplant services coordinators will arrange for your discharge. They will discuss with you plans for care at home, transportation to clinic visits, and housing, if needed.  You will be told how to take care of yourself after the transplant. This will include information about:  - Medications  - How often you need to visit the doctor or clinic  - What daily activities are allowed or off-limits    After leaving the hospital, you will return home.  You will have periodic follow-ups with the transplant team, as well as with your primary care doctor and any other specialists that may be recommended. The transplant services team will be available to answer any questions that you may have.)

ADAM_0004113_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Urinary incontinence ? (Also called: Loss of bladder control; Uncontrollable urination; Urination - uncontrollable; Incontinence - urinary)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003142.htm
Answer: Urinary (or bladder) incontinence happens when you are not able to keep urine from leaking out of your urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of your body from your bladder. You may leak urine from time to time. Or, you may not be able to hold any urine.  The three main types of urinary incontinence are:  - Stress incontinence -- occurs during activities like coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercise.  - Urge incontinence -- involves a strong, sudden need to urinate. Then the bladder squeezes and you lose urine. You don't have enough time after you feel the need to urinate to get to the bathroom before you do urinate.  - Overflow incontinence -- occurs when the bladder cannot empty. This leads to dribbling.    Mixed incontinence occurs when you have more than one type of urinary incontinence.  Bowel incontinence is when you are unable to control the passage of stool. It is not covered in this article.)

Answer: Causes of urinary incontinence include:  - Blockage in the urinary system  - Brain or nerve problems  - Dementia or other mental health problems that make it hard to feel and respond to the urge to urinate  - Problems with the urinary system  - Nerve and muscle problems    Incontinence may be sudden and go away after a short period of time. Or, it may continue long-term. Causes of sudden or temporary incontinence include:  - Bedrest -- for example, when recovering from surgery  - Certain medications (such as diuretics, antidepressants, tranquilizers, some cough and cold remedies, and antihistamines)  - Mental confusion  - Pregnancy  - Prostate infection or inflammation  - Stool impaction from severe constipation, which causes pressure on the bladder  - Urinary tract infection or inflammation  - Weight gain    Causes that may be more long-term:  - Alzheimer's disease  - Bladder cancer  - Bladder spasms  - Depression  - Large prostate in men  - Nervous system conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or stroke  - Nerve or muscle damage after radiation treatment to the pelvis  - Pelvic prolapse in women -- falling or sliding of the bladder, urethra, or rectum into the vagina. This may be caused by pregnancy and delivery.  - Problems with the urinary tract  - Spinal cord injuries  - Weakness of the sphincter, the circle-shaped muscles that open and close the bladder. This can be caused by prostate surgery in men, or surgery to the vagina in women.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003142.htm
Answer: If you have symptoms of incontinence, see your health care provider for tests and a treatment plan. Which treatment you get depends on what caused your incontinence and what type you have.  There are four main treatment approaches for urinary incontinence:  Lifestyle changes. These changes may help improve incontinence. You may need to make these changes along with other treatments.  - Keep your bowel movements regular to avoid constipation. Try increasing the fiber in your diet.  - Quit smoking to reduce coughing and bladder irritation. Smoking also increases your risk for bladder cancer.  - Avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks such as coffee, which can stimulate your bladder.  - Lose weight if you need to.  - Avoid foods and drinks that may irritate your bladder. These include spicy foods, carbonated drinks, and citrus fruits and juices.  - If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar under good control.    For urine leaks, wear absorbent pads or undergarments. There are many well-designed products no one else will notice.  Bladder training and pelvic floor exercises. Bladder retraining helps you gain better control over your bladder. Kegel exercises can help strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor. Your provider can show you how to do them. Many women do not do these exercises correctly, even if they believe they are doing them correctly. Often, people benefit from formal bladder strengthening and retraining with a pelvic floor specialist.  Medicines. Depending on the type of incontinence you have, your health care provider may prescribe one or more medicines. These drugs help prevent muscle spasms, relax the bladder, and improve bladder function. Your provider can help you learn how to take these medicines and manage their side effects.  Surgery. If other treatments do not work, or you have severe incontinence, your provider may recommend surgery. The type of surgery you have will depend on:  - The type of incontinence you have (such as urge, stress, or overflow)  - How severe your symptoms are  - The cause (such as pelvic prolapse, enlarged prostate, enlarged uterus, or other causes)    If you have overflow incontinence or you cannot fully empty your bladder, you may need to use a catheter. You may use a catheter that stays in long term, or one that you are taught to put in and take out yourself.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/bladder-cancer
Answer: Bladder cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the bladder become abnormal and multiply without control or order. The bladder is a hollow, muscular organ in the lower abdomen that stores urine until it is ready to be excreted from the body. The most common type of bladder cancer begins in cells lining the inside of the bladder and is called transitional cell carcinoma (TCC).  Bladder cancer may cause blood in the urine, pain during urination, frequent urination, or the feeling that one needs to urinate without results. These signs and symptoms are not specific to bladder cancer, however. They also can be caused by noncancerous conditions such as infections.)

GHR_0000128_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to bladder cancer ? (Also called: Cancer of the bladder; Malignant tumor of urinary bladder; Urinary bladder cancer)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/bladder-cancer
Answer: As with most cancers, the exact causes of bladder cancer are not known; however, many risk factors are associated with this disease. Many of the major risk factors are environmental, such as smoking and exposure to certain industrial chemicals. Studies suggest that chronic bladder inflammation, a parasitic infection called schistosomiasis, and some medications used to treat cancer are other environmental risk factors associated with bladder cancer.  Genetic factors are also likely to play an important role in determining bladder cancer risk. Researchers have studied the effects of mutations in several genes, including FGFR3, RB1, HRAS, TP53, and TSC1, on the formation and growth of bladder tumors. Each of these genes plays a critical role in regulating cell division by preventing cells from dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Alterations in these genes may help explain why some bladder cancers grow and spread more rapidly than others.  Deletions of part or all of chromosome 9 are common events in bladder tumors. Researchers believe that several genes that control cell growth and division are probably located on chromosome 9. They are working to determine whether a loss of these genes plays a role in the development and progression of bladder cancer.  Most of the genetic changes associated with bladder cancer develop in bladder tissue during a person's lifetime, rather than being inherited from a parent. Some people, however, appear to inherit a reduced ability to break down certain chemicals, which makes them more sensitive to the cancer-causing effects of tobacco smoke and industrial chemicals.)

Answer: If you get very sick or badly hurt and need help right away, you should use emergency medical services. These services use specially trained people and specially equipped facilities.    You may need care in the hospital emergency room (ER). Doctors and nurses there treat emergencies, such as heart attacks and injuries. For some emergencies, you need help where you are. Emergency medical technicians, or EMTs, do specific rescue jobs. They answer emergency calls and give basic medical care. Some EMTs are paramedics - they have training to do medical procedures on site. They usually take you to the ER for more care.

MPlusHealthTopics_0000933_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Urine and Urination
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/urineandurination.html
Answer: Summary : Your kidneys make urine by filtering wastes and extra water from your blood. The waste is called urea. Your blood carries it to the kidneys. From the kidneys, urine travels down two thin tubes called ureters to the bladder. The bladder stores urine until you are ready to urinate. It swells into a round shape when it is full and gets smaller when empty. If your urinary system is healthy, your bladder can hold up to 16 ounces (2 cups) of urine comfortably for 2 to 5 hours.    You may have problems with urination if you have       - Kidney failure    - Urinary tract infections     - An enlarged prostate    - Bladder control problems like incontinence, overactive bladder, or interstitial cystitis    - A blockage that prevents you from emptying your bladder        Some conditions may also cause you to have blood or protein in your urine. If you have a urinary problem, see your healthcare provider. Urinalysis and other urine tests can help to diagnose the problem. Treatment depends on the cause.

ADAM_0000179_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Am I in labor? (Also called: False labor; Braxton Hicks contractions; Prodromal labor; Latent labor; Pregnancy - labor)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000508.htm
Answer: Summary : If you've never given birth before, you may think you'll just know when the time comes. In reality, it isn't always easy to know when you're going into labor. The steps leading up to labor can drag on for days.  Keep in mind that your due date is just a general idea of when your labor may start. Normal term labor can start any time between 3 weeks before and 2 weeks after this date.

False labor (Braxton Hicks contractions) : Most pregnant women feel mild contractions before true labor begins. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions, which:  - Are typically short  - Are not painful  - Do not come at regular intervals  - Are not accompanied by bleeding, leaking fluid, or decreased fetal movement    This stage is called ""prodromal"" or ""latent"" labor.

Other signs that labor is near : Lightening: This happens when your baby's head ""drops"" down into your pelvis.   - Your belly will look lower. It will be easier for you to breathe because the baby is not putting pressure on your lungs.  - You may need to urinate more often because the baby is pressing on your bladder.  - For first-time mothers, lightening often happens a few weeks before birth. For women who have had babies before, it may not happen until labor has begun.    Bloody show: If you have bloody or brownish discharge from your vagina, it may mean your cervix has begun to dilate. The mucous plug that sealed your cervix for the last 9 months may be visible. This is a good sign. But active labor may still be days away.   Your baby moves less: If you feel less movement, call your doctor or midwife, as sometimes decreased movement can mean that the baby is in trouble.   Your water breaks: When the amniotic sac (bag of fluid around the baby) breaks, you will feel fluid leak from your vagina. It may come out in a trickle or a gush.   - For most women, contractions come within 24 hours after the bag of water breaks.  - Even if contractions don't begin, let your doctor or midwife know as soon as you think your water has broken.    Diarrhea: Some women have the urge to go to the bathroom often to empty their bowels. If this happens and your stools are looser than normal, you may be going into labor.   Nesting: There's no science behind the theory, but plenty of women feel the sudden urge to ""nest"" right before labor starts. If you feel the need to vacuum the entire house at 3 a.m., or finish your work in the baby's nursery, you may be getting ready for labor.

True labor : In real labor, your contractions will:   - Come regularly and get closer together  - Last from 30 to 70 seconds, and will get longer  - Not stop, no matter what you do  - Radiate (reach) into your lower back and upper belly  - Get stronger or become more intense as time goes on  - Make you unable to talk to other people or laugh at a joke

When to call the doctor or midwife : Call your doctor or midwife right away if you have:   - Leaking amniotic fluid  - Decreased fetal movement  - Any vaginal bleeding other than light spotting  - Regular, painful contractions every 5 to 10 minutes for 60 minutes   Call for any other reason if you are unsure what to do.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003021.htm
Answer: Constitutional growth delay refers to children who are small for their age but are growing at a normal rate. Puberty is often late in these children.  These children continue to grow after most of their peers have stopped. Most of the time, they will reach an adult height similar to their parents' height. However, other causes of growth delay must be ruled out.  Genetics may also play a role. One or both parents may be short. Short but healthy parents may have a healthy child who is in the shortest 5% for his or her age. These children are short, but they should reach the height of one or both of their parents.  Delayed or slower-than-expected growth can be caused by many different things, including:  - Chronic disease  - Endocrine disorders  - Emotional health  - Infection  - Poor nutrition    Many children with delayed growth also have delays in development.)

ADAM_0001462_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about ESR (Also called: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate; Sed rate; Sedimentation rate)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003638.htm
Answer: Summary : ESR stands for erythrocyte sedimentation rate. It is commonly called a ""sed rate.""  It is a test that indirectly measures how much inflammation is in the body.

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The blood sample is sent to a lab.  The test measures how fast red blood cells (called erythrocytes) fall to the bottom of a tall, thin tube.

How to Prepare for the Test : There are no special steps needed to prepare for this test.

How the Test will Feel : You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.

Why the Test is Performed : Reasons why a ""sed rate"" may be done include:  - Unexplained fevers  - Certain types of arthritis  - Muscle symptoms  - Other vague symptoms that cannot be explained   This test may also be used to monitor whether an illness is responding to treatment.   This test can be used to monitor inflammatory diseases or cancer. It is not used to diagnose a specific disorder.  However, the test is useful for detecting and monitoring:  - Autoimmune disorders  - Bone infections  - Certain forms of arthritis  - Inflammatory diseases that cause vague symptoms  - Tissue death

Normal Results : For adults (Westergren method):  - Men under 50 years old: less than 15 mm/hr  - Men over 50 years old: less than 20 mm/hr  - Women under 50 years old: less than 20 mm/hr  - Women over 50 years old: less than 30 mm/hr    For children (Westergren method):  - Newborn: 0 to 2 mm/hr  - Newborn to puberty: 3 to 13 mm/hr    Note: mm/hr = millimeters per hour  Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : An abnormal ESR may help with a diagnosis, but it does not prove that you have a certain condition. Other tests are almost always needed.  An increased ESR rate may be due to:  - Anemia  - Cancers such as lymphoma or multiple myeloma  - Kidney disease  - Pregnancy  - Thyroid disease    The immune system helps protect the body against harmful substances. An autoimmune disorder is when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. ESR is often higher than normal in people with an autoimmune disorder.  Common autoimmune disorders include:  - Lupus  - Rheumatoid arthritis in adults or children   Very high ESR levels occur with less common autoimmune disorders, including:  - Allergic vasculitis  - Giant cell arteritis  - Hyperfibrinogenemia (increased fibrinogen levels in the blood)  - Macroglobulinemia - primary  - Necrotizing vasculitis  - Polymyalgia rheumatica   An increased ESR rate may be due to some infections, including:  - Body-wide (systemic) infection  - Bone infections  - Infection of the heart or heart valves  - Rheumatic fever  - Severe skin infections, such as erysipelas  - Tuberculosis   Lower-than-normal levels occur with:  - Congestive heart failure  - Hyperviscosity  - Hypofibrinogenemia (decreased fibrinogen levels)  - Leukemia  - Low plasma protein (due to liver or kidney disease)  - Polycythemia  - Sickle cell anemia)

Answer: High foot arches are much less common than flat feet. They are more likely to be caused by a bone (orthopedic) or nerve (neurological) condition.  Unlike flat feet, highly arched feet tend to be painful because more stress is placed on the section of the foot between the ankle and toes (metatarsals). This condition can make it difficult to fit into shoes. People who have high arches most often need foot support. A high arch may cause disability.)

ADAM_0004364_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about 5'-nucleotidase (Also called: 5'-NT)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003575.htm
Answer: Summary : 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) is a protein produced by the liver. A test can be done to measure the amount of this protein in your blood.

How the Test is Performed : Blood is drawn from a vein. Most of the time, a vein on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand is used. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.  Next, the provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm.  Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.  In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.

How to Prepare for the Test : Your provider may tell you to stop taking some medicines that could interfere with the test. Drugs that may affect results include:  - Acetaminophen (Tylenol)  - Halothane  - Isoniazid  - Methyldopa  - Nitrofurantoin

How the Test Will Feel : You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.

Why the Test is Performed : Your doctor may order this test if you have signs of a liver problem. It is used mostly to tell if the high protein level is due to liver damage or skeletal muscle damage.

Normal Results : The normal value is 2 to 17 units per liter.  Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.  The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Greater than normal levels may indicate:  - Cholestasis (when bile, which is made by the liver to help digest fats, is blocked from flowing out of the liver  - Destruction of liver cells  - Hepatitis (liver inflammation)  - Liver ischemia (loss of blood and oxygen to the liver)  - Liver tumor  - Use of a liver-damaging drug

Risks : Slight from having blood drawn may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling light-headed  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  - Bruising)

Answer: Most of the time, medicines make our lives better. They reduce aches and pains, fight infections, and control problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes. But medicines can also cause unwanted reactions.    One problem is interactions, which may occur between       - Two drugs, such as aspirin and blood thinners    - Drugs and food, such as statins and grapefruit    - Drugs and supplements, such as gingko and blood thinners    - Drugs and diseases, such as aspirin and peptic ulcers       Interactions can change the actions of one or both drugs. The drugs might not work, or you could get side effects.    Side effects are unwanted effects caused by the drugs. Most are mild, such as a stomach aches or drowsiness, and go away after you stop taking the drug. Others can be more serious.    Drug allergies are another type of reaction. They can be mild or life-threatening. Skin reactions, such as hives and rashes, are the most common type. Anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction, is more rare.    When you start a new prescription or over-the-counter medication, make sure you understand how to take it correctly. Know which other medications and foods you need to avoid.

NHLBI_0000070_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes High Blood Cholesterol ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hbc
Answer: Many factors can affect the cholesterol levels in your blood. You can control some factors, but not others.
                
Factors You Can Control
                
Diet
                
Cholesterol is found in foods that come from animal sources, such as egg yolks, meat, and cheese. Some foods have fats that raise your cholesterol level.
                
For example, saturated fat raises your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level more than anything else in your diet. Saturated fat is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods.
                
Trans fatty acids (trans fats) raise your LDL cholesterol and lower your high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Trans fats are made when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil to harden it. Trans fats are found in some fried and processed foods.
                
Limiting foods with cholesterol, saturated fat, and trans fats can help you control your cholesterol levels.
                
Physical Activity and Weight
                
Lack of physical activity can lead to weight gain. Being overweight tends to raise your LDL level, lower your HDL level, and increase your total cholesterol level. (Total cholesterol is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood, including LDL and HDL.)
                
Routine physical activity can help you lose weight and lower your LDL cholesterol. Being physically active also can help you raise your HDL cholesterol level.
                
Factors You Cant Control
                
Heredity
                
High blood cholesterol can run in families. An inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolemia causes very high LDL cholesterol. (Inherited means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) This condition begins at birth, and it may cause a heart attack at an early age.
                
Age and Sex
                
Starting at puberty, men often have lower levels of HDL cholesterol than women. As women and men age, their LDL cholesterol levels often rise. Before age 55, women usually have lower LDL cholesterol levels than men. However, afterage 55, women can have higher LDL levels than men.)

NHLBI_0000071_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes High Blood Pressure ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hbp
Answer: Changes, either fromgenesor the environment, in the bodys normal functions may cause high blood pressure, including changes to kidney fluid and salt balances, therenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,sympathetic nervous systemactivity, and blood vessel structure and function.
                
Biology and High Blood Pressure
                
Researchers continue to study how various changes in normal body functions cause high blood pressure. The key functions affected in high blood pressure include:
                
Kidney fluid and salt balances
                
Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
                
Sympathetic nervous system activity
                
Blood vessel structure and function
                

                
Kidney Fluid and Salt Balances
                
The kidneys normally regulate the bodys salt balance by retaining sodium and water and excreting potassium. Imbalances in this kidney function can expand blood volumes, which can cause high blood pressure.
                

                
Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System
                
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system makes angiotensin and aldosterone hormones. Angiotensin narrows or constricts blood vessels, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Aldosterone controls how the kidneys balance fluid and salt levels. Increased aldosterone levels or activity may change this kidney function, leading to increased blood volumes and high blood pressure.
                

                
Sympathetic Nervous System Activity
                
The sympathetic nervous system has important functions in blood pressure regulation, including heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. Researchers are investigating whether imbalances in this system cause high blood pressure.
                

                
Blood Vessel Structure and Function
                
Changes in the structure and function of small and large arteries may contribute to high blood pressure. The angiotensin pathway and the immune system may stiffen small and large arteries, which can affect blood pressure.
                

                
Genetic Causes of High Blood Pressure
                
Much of the understanding of the body systems involved in high blood pressure has come from genetic studies. High blood pressure often runs in families. Years of research have identified many genes and other mutations associated with high blood pressure, some in the renal salt regulatory and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathways. However, these known genetic factors only account for 2 to 3percent of all cases. Emerging research suggests that certain DNA changes during fetal development also may cause the development of high blood pressure later in life.
                
Environmental Causes of High Blood Pressure
                
Environmental causes of high blood pressure include unhealthy lifestyle habits, being overweight or obese, and medicines.
                

                
Unhealthy Lifestyle Habits
                
Unhealthy lifestyle habits can cause high blood pressure, including:
                
High dietary sodium intake and sodium sensitivity
                
Drinking excess amounts of alcohol
                
Lack of physical activity
                

                
Overweight and Obesity
                
Research studies show that being overweight or obese can increase the resistance in the blood vessels, causing the heart to work harder and leading to high blood pressure.
                

                
Medicines
                
Prescription medicines such as asthma or hormone therapies, including birth control pills and estrogen, and over-the-counter medicines such as cold relief medicines may cause this form of high blood pressure. This happens because medicines can change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances, cause your blood vessels to constrict, or impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system leading to high blood pressure.
                
Other Medical Causes of High Blood Pressure
                
Other medical causes of high blood pressure include other medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea, thyroid problems, or certain tumors. This happens because these other conditions change the way your body controls fluids, sodium, and hormones in your blood, which leads to secondary high blood pressure.)

Answer: Atenolol is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. It also is used to prevent angina (chest pain) and improve survival after a heart attack. Atenolol is in a class of medications called beta blockers. It works by relaxing blood vessels and slowing heart rate to improve blood flow and decrease blood pressure.  High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.)

Answer: When your child complains of abdominal pain, see if they can describe it to you. Here are different kinds of pain:  - Generalized pain or pain over more than half of the belly. Your child can have this kind of pain when they have a stomach virus, indigestion, gas, or when they become constipated.  - Cramp-like pain is likely to be due to gas and bloating. It is often followed by diarrhea. It is usually not serious.  - Colicky pain is pain that comes in waves, usually starts and ends suddenly, and is often severe.  - Localized pain is pain in only one area of the belly. Your child may be having problems with their appendix, gallbladder, a hernia (twisted bowel), ovary, testicles, or stomach (ulcers).    If you have an infant or toddler, your child depends on you seeing that they are in pain. Suspect abdominal pain if your child is:  - More fussy than usual  - Drawing their legs up toward the belly  - Eating poorly)

Answer: Most of the time, you can use home care remedies and wait for your child to get better. If you are worried or your child's pain is getting worse, or the pain lasts longer than 24 hours, call your health care provider.   Have your child lie quietly to see if the abdominal pain goes away.   Offer sips of water or other clear fluids.   Suggest that your child try to pass stool.  Avoid solid foods for a few hours. Then try small amounts of mild foods such as rice, applesauce, or crackers.  Do not give your child foods or drinks that are irritating to the stomach. Avoid:  - Caffeine  - Carbonated beverages  - Citrus  - Dairy products  - Fried or greasy foods  - High-fat foods  - Tomato products   Do not give aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen (Tylenol), or similar medicines without first asking your child's provider.  To prevent many types of abdominal pain:  - Avoid fatty or greasy foods.  - Drink plenty of water each day.  - Eat small meals more often.  - Exercise regularly.  - Limit foods that produce gas.  - Make sure that meals are well-balanced and high in fiber. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.)

ADAM_0000123_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Aging changes in the heart and blood vessels (Also called: Heart disease - aging; Atherosclerosis - aging)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/004006.htm
Answer: Summary : Some changes in the heart and blood vessels normally occur with age, but many other changes that are common with aging are due to modifiable factors that, if not treated, can lead to heart disease.  BACKGROUND  The heart has two sides. The right side pumps blood to the lungs to receive oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. The left side pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body.  Blood flows out of the heart through arteries, which branch out and get smaller and smaller as they go into the tissues. In the tissues, they become tiny capillaries.  Capillaries are where the blood gives up oxygen and nutrients to the tissues, and receives carbon dioxide and wastes back from the tissues. Then, the vessels begin to collect together into larger and larger veins, which return blood to the heart.      Watch this video about:   Blood flow     AGING CHANGES  Heart:  - The heart has a natural pacemaker system that controls the heartbeat. Some of the pathways of this system may develop fibrous tissue and fat deposits. The natural pacemaker (the SA node) loses some of its cells. These changes may result in a slightly slower heart rate.  - A slight increase in the size of the heart, especially the left ventricle, is not uncommon. The heart wall thickens, so the amount of blood that the chamber can hold may actually decrease despite the increased overall heart size. The heart may fill more slowly.  - Heart changes cause the ECG of a normal, healthy older person to be slightly different than the ECG of a healthy younger adult. Abnormal rhythms (arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation, are more common in older people. They may be caused by heart disease.  - Normal changes in the heart include deposits of the ""aging pigment,"" lipofuscin. The heart muscle cells degenerate slightly. The valves inside the heart, which control the direction of blood flow, thicken and become stiffer. A heart murmur caused by valve stiffness is fairly common in the elderly.    Blood vessels:  - Receptors called baroreceptors monitor the blood pressure and make changes to help maintain a fairly constant blood pressure when a person changes positions or is doing other activities. The baroreceptors become less sensitive with aging. This may explain why many older people have orthostatic hypotension, a condition in which the blood pressure falls when a person goes from lying or sitting to standing. This causes dizziness because there is less blood flow to the brain.  - The capillary walls thicken slightly. This may cause a slightly slower rate of exchange of nutrients and wastes.  - The main artery from the heart (aorta) becomes thicker, stiffer, and less flexible. This is probably related to changes in the connective tissue of the blood vessel wall. This makes the blood pressure higher and makes the heart work harder, which may lead to thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophy). The other arteries also thicken and stiffen. In general, most elderly people have a moderate increase in blood pressure.    Blood:  - The blood itself changes slightly with age. Normal aging causes a reduction in total body water. As part of this, there is less fluid in the bloodstream, so blood volume decreases.  - The speed with which red blood cells are produced in response to stress or illness is reduced. This creates a slower response to blood loss and anemia.  - Most of the white blood cells stay at the same levels, although certain white blood cells important to immunity (neutrophils) decrease in their number and ability to fight off bacteria. This reduces the ability to resist infection.    EFFECT OF CHANGES  Normally, the heart continues to pump enough blood to supply all parts of the body. However, an older heart may not be able to pump blood as well when you make it work harder.  Some of the things that make your heart work harder are:  - Certain medicines  - Emotional stress  - Physical exertion  - Illness  - Infections  - Injuries    COMMON PROBLEMS  - Angina (chest pain caused by temporarily reduced blood flow to the heart muscle), shortness of breath with exertion, and heart attack can result from coronary artery disease.  - Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) of various types can occur.  - Anemia may occur, possibly related to malnutrition, chronic infections, blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, or as a complication of other diseases or medicines.  - Arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) is very common. Fatty plaque deposits inside the blood vessels cause them to narrow and totally block blood vessels.  - Congestive heart failure is also very common in the elderly. In people older than 75, congestive heart failure occurs 10 times more often than in younger adults.  - Coronary artery disease is fairly common. It is often a result of arteriosclerosis.  - High blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension are more common with older age. Elderly people on blood pressure medicines need to work with their doctor to find the best way to manage their high blood pressure. This is because too much medicine may cause low blood pressure and could lead to a fall.  - Heart valve diseases are fairly common. Aortic stenosis, or narrowing of the aortic valve, is the most common valve disease in the elderly.  - Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or strokes can occur if blood flow to the brain is disrupted.    Other problems with the heart and blood vessels include the following:  - Blood clots  - Deep vein thrombosis  - Thrombophlebitis  - Peripheral vascular disease, resulting in intermittent pain in the legs when walking (claudication)  - Varicose veins  - Aneurysms may develop in one of the major arteries from the heart or in the brain. Aneurysms are an abnormal widening or ballooning of a part of an artery due to weakness in the wall of the blood vessel. If an aneurysm bursts it may cause bleeding and death.    PREVENTION  - You can help your circulatory system (heart and blood vessels). Heart disease risk factors that you have some control over include high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes, obesity, and smoking.  - Eat a heart-healthy diet with reduced amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol, and control your weight. Follow your health care provider's recommendations for treating high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes. Reduce or stop smoking.  - Men between the ages of 65 to 75 who have ever smoked should be screened for aneurysms in their abdominal aorta.    Get more exercise:  - Exercise may help prevent obesity, and it helps people with diabetes control their blood sugar.  - Exercise may help you maintain your abilities as much as possible, and it reduces stress.  - Moderate exercise is one of the best things you can do to keep your heart, and the rest of your body, healthy. Consult with your provider before beginning a new exercise program. Exercise moderately and within your capabilities, but do it regularly.  - People who exercise usually have less body fat and smoke less than people who do not exercise. They also tend to have fewer blood pressure problems and less heart disease.    Have regular check-ups for your heart:  - Have your blood pressure checked every year. If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, your blood pressure may need to be monitored more closely.  - If your cholesterol level is normal, have it rechecked every 5 years. If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, your cholesterol may need to be monitored more closely.  - If you are an older man (between the ages of 65 to 75) and you have a history of smoking, you should be screened for aneurysms in one of the major arteries of the heart.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000768.htm
Answer: The cause of primary brain tumors is unknown. Primary brain tumors may be:  - Not cancerous (benign)  - Invasive (spread to nearby areas)  - Cancerous (malignant)    Brain tumors are classified based on:  - The exact site of the tumor  - The type of tissue involved  - Whether it is cancerous    Brain tumors can directly destroy brain cells. They can also indirectly damage cells by pushing on other parts of the brain. This leads to swelling and increased pressure inside the skull.  Tumors can occur at any age. Many tumors are more common at a certain age. In general, brain tumors in children are very rare.  COMMON TUMOR TYPES  Astrocytomas are usually noncancerous, slow-growing tumors. They commonly develop in children ages 5 to 8. Also called low-grade gliomas, these are the most common brain tumors in children.  Medulloblastomas are the most common type of childhood brain cancer. Most medulloblastomas occur before age 10.  Ependymomas are a type of childhood brain tumor that can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The location and type of ependymoma determine the type of therapy needed to control the tumor.  Brainstem gliomas are very rare tumors that occur almost only in children. The average age at which they develop is about 6. The tumor may grow very large before causing symptoms.)

ADAM_0001480_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Exercise and age (Also called: Age and exercise)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002080.htm
Answer: Summary : It is never too late to start exercising. Exercise has benefits at any age.  Don't worry if you have never exercised, or if you stopped exercising for some reason. Being physically active can help youto keep doingthe things you enjoy and stay independent as you age. The right kind of regular exercise can also reduce yourriskof heart disease, diabetes, and falls.  An effective exercise program needs to be fun and helps to keep you motivated. It helps to have a goal. Your goal might be to:  - Manage a health condition  - Reduce stress  - Improve your stamina  - Be able to buy clothes in a smaller size   Your exercise program mayalso be a way for you to socialize. Taking exercise classes or exercising with a friend are both good ways to be social.  You may have a hard time starting an exercise routine. Once you do start, though, you will begin to notice the benefits, including improved sleep and self-esteem.  Exercise and physical activity can also:  - Improve or maintain your strength and fitness  - Make it easier to do the things you want to do  - Help your balance and walking  - Help with feelings of depression or anxiety and improve your mood  - Maintain your thinking skills (cognitive function) as you get older  - Prevent or treat diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, breast and colon cancer, and osteoporosis   Always talk to your health care provider before starting an exercise program.Your provider can suggest exercises and activities that are right for you.  Exercises can be grouped into four main categories, although many exercises fit into more than one category:  AEROBIC EXERCISE   Aerobic exercise increases your breathing and heart rate. These exercises help your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. They may prevent or delay many diseases, such as diabetes, colon and breast cancers, and heart disease.  - Aerobic sports activities include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, biking, climbing, tennis, and basketball  - Aerobic activities you can do every day include dancing, yard work, pushing your grandchild on a swing, and vacuuming   MUSCLE STRENGTH  Improving your muscle strength can help you climb stairs, carry groceries, and stay independent. You can build muscle strength by:  - Lifting weights or using a resistance band  - Performing everyday activities, such as carrying a full laundry basket from the basement, carrying your smaller grandchildren, or lifting things in the garden    BALANCE EXERCISES  Balance exercises help prevent falls, which is a concern for older adults. Many exercises that strengthen the muscles in the legs, hips, and lower back will improve your balance. It is often best to learn balance exercises from a physical therapist before starting on your own.  Balance exercises may include:  - Standing on one foot  - Walking heel-to-toe  - Tai chi  - Standing on tiptoe to reach something on the top shelf  - Walking up and down the stairs    STRETCHING  Stretching can help your body stay flexible. To stay limber:  - Learn shoulder, upper arm, and calf stretches  - Take yoga classes  - Do everyday activities, such as making your bed or bending over to tie your shoes)

It is measured in weeks, from the first day of the woman's last menstrual cycle to the current date. A normal pregnancy can range from 38 to 42 weeks.  Infants born before 37 weeks are considered premature. Infants born after 42 weeks are considered postmature.

Information : Gestational age can be determined before or after birth.  Before birth, your doctor will use ultrasound to measure the size of the baby's head, abdomen, and thigh bone. This helps determine how well the baby is growing in the womb.   After birth, gestational age can be measured by looking at the baby's weight, length, head circumference, vital signs, reflexes, muscle tone, posture, and the condition of the skin and hair. The baby's developmental gestational age may not be the same as the calendar age. For example, an infant born at 36 weeks may actually have a developmental gestational age of 38 weeks. This baby may be more like a full-term infant than a baby born prematurely.  Determining a babys gestational age is important. It gives your doctor information that help set the babys medical treatment plan.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007465.htm
Answer: Summary : You should visit your health care provider regularly, even if you feel healthy. The purpose of these visits is to:  - Screen for medical issues  - Assess your risk of future medical problems  - Encourage a healthy lifestyle  - Update vaccinations  - Help you get to know your provider in case of an illness

Information : Even if you feel fine, you should still see your health care provider for regular checkups. These visits can help you avoid problems in the future. For example, the only way to find out if you have high blood pressure is to have it checked regularly. High blood sugar and high cholesterol levels also may not have any symptoms in the early stages. Simple blood tests can check for these conditions.   There are specific times when you should see your provider. Below are screening guidelines for men ages 40 to 64.  BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENING  - Have your blood pressure checked every 2 years. If the top number (systolic number) is between 120 and 139 or the bottom number (diastolic number) is between 80 and 89 mm Hg then have it checked every year.  - Watch for blood pressure screenings in your area. Ask your provider if you can stop in to have your blood pressure checked. Or check your blood pressure using the automated machines at local grocery stores and pharmacies.  - If the top number is greater than 140 or the bottom number is greater than 90, schedule an appointment with your provider.  - If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, you may need to have your blood pressure checked more often.     CHOLESTEROL SCREENING AND HEART DISEASE PREVENTION  - If you are age 35 or older, you should be checked every 5 years.  - If you have high cholesterol levels, diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, you may need to be checked more often.  - Some men should consider taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks. Ask your provider before you start aspirin because aspirin may increase your risk for bleeding.    DIABETES SCREENING  - If you are age 45 or older, you should be screened every 3 years.  - If you are overweight, ask your provider if you should be screened at a younger age. Asian Americans should be screened if their BMI is greater than 23.  - If your blood pressure is above 135/80 mm Hg, or you have other risk factors for diabetes, your provider may test your blood sugar level for diabetes.    COLON CANCER SCREENING  If you are under age 50, you should be screened if you have a strong family history of colon cancer or polyps. Screening may also be considered if you have risk factors such as a history of inflammatory bowel disease or polyps.  If you are between ages 50 to 75, you should be screened for colorectal cancer. There are several screening tests available. Some common screening tests include:  - A stool occult blood test done every year  - Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years along with a stool occult blood test every 3 years  - Colonoscopy every 10 years    You may need a colonoscopy more often if you have risk factors for colon cancer, such as:  - Ulcerative colitis  - A personal or family history of colorectal cancer  - A history of colorectal adenomas    DENTAL EXAM  - Go to the dentist once or twice every year for an exam and cleaning. Your dentist will evaluate if you have a need for more frequent visits    EYE EXAM  Have an eye exam every 2 to 4 years ages 40 to 54 and every 1 to 3 years ages 55 to 64. Your provider may recommend more frequent eye exams if you have vision problems or glaucoma risk.  IMMUNIZATIONS  - You should get a flu shot every year.  - Your doctor may recommend other vaccinations if you have certain medical conditions, such as diabetes.  - You should have a tetanus-diphtheria booster vaccination every 10 years. If you have not received a tetanus-diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine as one of your tetanus-diphtheria vaccines, you should have it once.  - You may get a shingles or herpes zoster vaccination once after age 60.    OSTEOPOROSIS SCREENING  - If you are between ages 50 to 70 and have risk factors for osteoporosis, you should discuss screening with your provider.  - Risk factors can include long-term steroid use, low body weight, smoking, heavy alcohol use, having a fracture after age 50, or a family history of osteoporosis.     PHYSICAL EXAM  - Your blood pressure should be checked at least every two years.  - Your height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) should be checked at every exam.    During your exam, your provider may ask you about:  - Depression  - Diet and exercise  - Alcohol and tobacco use  - Safety, such as use of seat belts and smoke detectors    PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING  - Most men age 50 or older should discuss screening for prostate cancer with their provider. African American men and those with a family history of prostate cancer in a first degree relative younger than age 65 should discuss screening at age 45.  - The potential benefits of PSA testing as a routine screening test have not been shown to outweigh the harms of testing and treatment. If you choose to be tested, the PSA blood test is most often done every year.  - Prostate examinations are no longer routinely done on men with no symptoms.     TESTICULAR EXAM  - The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) now recommends against performing testicular self-exams. Doing testicular self-exams has been shown to have little to no benefit.    LUNG CANCER SCREENING  The USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in adults aged 55 to 80 years who:  - Have a 30 pack-year smoking history AND  - Currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years)

ADAM_0003479_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about School-age children development
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002017.htm
Answer: Summary : School-age child development describes the expected physical, emotional, and mental abilities of children ages 6 to 12.

Information : PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT  School-age children usually have smooth and strong motor skills. However, their coordination (especially eye-hand), endurance, balance, and physical abilities vary.  Fine motor skills may also vary widely. These skills can affect a child's ability to write neatly, dress appropriately, and perform certain chores, such as making beds or doing dishes.  There will be big differences in height, weight, and build among children of this age range. It is important to remember that genetic background, as well as nutrition and exercise, may affect a child's growth.  A sense of body image begins developing around age 6. Sedentary habits in school-age children are linked to a risk for obesity and heart disease in adults. Children in this age group should get 1 hour of physical activity per day.  There can also be a big difference in the age at which children begin to develop secondary sexual characteristics. For girls, secondary sex characteristics include:  - Breast development  - Underarm and pubic hair growth    For boys, they include:  - Growth of underarm, chest, and pubic hair  - Growth of testicles and penis    SCHOOL  By age 5, most children are ready to start learning in a school setting. The first few years focus on learning the fundamentals.   In 3rd grade, the focus becomes more complex. Reading becomes more about the content than identifying letters and words.   An ability to pay attention is important for success both at school and at home. A 6-year-old should be able to focus on a task for at least 15 minutes. By age 9, a child should be able to focus attention for about an hour.  It is important for the child to learn how to deal with failure or frustration without losing self-esteem. There are many causes of school failure, including:   - Learning disabilities, such a reading disability  - Stressors, such as bullying  - Mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression    If you suspect any of these in your child, talk to your child's teacher or health care provider.  LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT  Early school-age children should be able to use simple, but complete, sentences that contain an average of 5 to 7 words. As the child goes through the elementary school years, grammar and pronunciation become normal. Children use more complex sentences as they grow.  Language delays may be due to hearing or intelligence problems. In addition, children who are unable to express themselves well may be more likely to have aggressive behavior or temper tantrums.  A 6-year-old child normally can follow a series of 3 commands in a row. By age 10, most children can follow 5 commands in a row. Children who have a problem in this area may try to cover it up with backtalk or clowning around. They will rarely ask for help because they are afraid of being teased.  BEHAVIOR  Frequent physical complaints (such as sore throats, tummy aches, or arm or leg pain) may simply be due to a child's increased body awareness. Although there is often no physical evidence for such complaints, the complaints should be investigated to rule out possible health conditions. This will also assure the child that the parent is concerned about their well-being.  Peer acceptance becomes more important during the school-age years. Children may take part in certain behaviors to be part of ""the group."" Talking about these behaviors with your child will allow the child to feel accepted in the group, without crossing the boundaries of the family's behavior standards.  Friendships at this age tend to be mainly with members of the same sex. In fact, younger school-age children often talk about members of the opposite sex as being ""strange"" or ""awful."" Children become less negative about the opposite sex as they get closer to adolescence.  Lying, cheating, and stealing are all examples of behaviors that school-age children may ""try on"" as they learn how to negotiate the expectations and rules placed on them by family, friends, school, and society. Parents should deal with these behaviors in private with their child (so that the child's friends don't tease them). Parents should show forgiveness, and punish in a way that is related to the behavior.  It is important for the child to learn how to deal with failure or frustration without losing self-esteem.  SAFETY  Safety is important for school-age children.  - School-age children are highly active. They need physical activity and peer approval, and want to try more daring and adventurous behaviors.  - Children should be taught to play sports in appropriate, safe, supervised areas, with proper equipment and rules. Bicycles, skateboards, in-line skates, and other types of recreational sports equipment should fit the child. They should be used only while following traffic and pedestrian rules, and while using safety equipment such as knee, elbow, and wrist pads or braces, and helmets. Sports equipment should not be used at night or in extreme weather conditions.  - Swimming and water safety lessons may help prevent drowning.  - Safety instruction regarding matches, lighters, barbecues, stoves, and open fires can prevent major burns.  - Wearing seat belts is the most important way to prevent major injury or death from a motor vehicle accident.    PARENTING TIPS  - If your child's physical development appears to be outside the norm, talk to your health care provider.  - If language skills appear to be lagging, request a speech and language evaluation.  - Keep close communication with teachers, other school employees, and parents of your child's friends so you are aware of possible problems.  - Encourage children to express themselves openly and talk about concerns without fear of punishment.  - While encouraging children to participate in a variety of social and physical experiences, be careful not to over-schedule free time. Free play or simple, quiet time is important so the child does not always feel pushed to perform.  - Children today are exposed, through the media and their peers, to many issues dealing with violence, sexuality, and substance abuse. Discuss these issues openly with your children to share concerns or correct misconceptions. You may need to set limits to ensure children will be exposed to certain issues only when they are ready.  - Encourage children to participate in constructive activities such as sports, clubs, arts, music, and scouts. Being inactive at this age increases the risk of lifetime obesity. However, it is important not to over-schedule your child. Try to find a balance between family time, school work, free play, and structured activities.  - School-age children should participate in family chores such as setting the table and cleaning up.  - Limit screen time (television and other media) to 2 hours a day.)

Answer: What are the signs and symptoms of Spinocerebellar ataxia 40? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Spinocerebellar ataxia 40. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Broad-based gait - Dysarthria - Dysdiadochokinesis - Hyperreflexia - Intention tremor - Pontocerebellar atrophy - Spastic paraparesis - Unsteady gait - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.)

ADAM_0000781_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Chickenpox ? (Also called: Varicella; Chicken pox)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001592.htm
Answer: Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is a member of the herpesvirus family. The same virus also causes shingles in adults.  Chickenpox can be spread very easily to others from 1 to 2 days before blisters appear until all the blisters have crusted over. You may get chickenpox:  - From touching the fluids from a chickenpox blister  - If someone with the disease coughs or sneezes near you   Most cases of chickenpox occur in children younger than age 10. The disease is most often mild, although serious complications may occur. Adults and older children get sicker than younger children in most cases.  Children whose mothers have had chickenpox or have received the chickenpox vaccine are not very likely to catch it before they are 1 year old. If they do catch chickenpox, they often have mild cases. This is because antibodies from their mothers' blood help protect them. Children under 1 year old whose mothers have not had chickenpox or the vaccine can get severe chickenpox.  Severe chickenpox symptoms are more common in children whose immune system does not work well.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001592.htm
Answer: Because chickenpox is airborne and spreads very easily even before the rash appears, it is hard to avoid.  A vaccine to prevent chickenpox is part of a child's routine vaccine schedule.  The vaccine often prevents the chickenpox disease completely or makes the illness very mild.  Talk to your provider if you think your child might be at high risk for complications and might have been exposed. Taking preventive steps right away may be important. Giving the vaccine early after exposure may still reduce the severity of the disease.)

ADAM_0003558_Sec2.txt,"Question: What is (are) Shingles vaccine - what you need to know ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007609.htm
Answer: What is shingles?  Shingles is a painful skin rash, often with blisters. It is also called Herpes Zoster, or just Zoster.  A shingles rash usually appears on one side of the face or body and lasts from 2 to 4 weeks. Its main symptom is pain, which can be quite severe. Other symptoms of shingles can include fever, headache, chills and upset stomach. Very rarely, a shingles infection can lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitits) or death.  For about 1 person in 5, severe pain can continue even long after the rash clears up. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia.  Shingles is caused by the Varicella Zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox.  Only someone who has had chickenpox -- or, rarely, has gotten chickenpox vaccine -- can get shingles. The virus stays in your body, and can cause shingles many years later.  You can't catch shingles from another person with shingles. However, a person who has never had chickenpox (or chickenpox vaccine) could get chickenpox from someone with shingles. This is not very common.  Shingles is far more common in people 50 years of age and older than in younger people. It is also more common in people whose immune systems are weakened because of a disease such as cancer, or drugs such as steroids or chemotherapy.  At least 1 million people a year in the United States get shingles. Shingles vaccine  A vaccine for shingles was licensed in 2006. In clinical trials, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by 50%. It can also reduce pain in people who still get shingles after being vaccinated.  A single dose of shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years of age and older. Some people should not get shingles vaccine or should wait.  A person should not get shingles vaccine who:  - Has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of shingles vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.  - Has a weakened immune system because of current:        - AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system,    - Treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as prolonged use of high-dose steroids,    - Cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy,    - Cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma.      - Is pregnant, or might be pregnant. Women should not become pregnant until at least 4 weeks after getting shingles vaccine.    Someone with a minor acute illness, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But anyone with a moderate or severe acute illness should usually wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. This includes anyone with a temperature of 101.3F or higher. What are the risks from shingles vaccine?  A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. However, the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.  No serious problems have been identified with shingles vaccine.  Mild problems  - Redness, soreness, swelling, or itching at the site of the injection (about 1 person in 3).  - Headache (about 1 person in 70).    Like all vaccines, shingles vaccine is being closely monitored for unusual or severe problems. What if there is a serious reaction?  What should I look for?  - Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.    Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.   What should I do?  - If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.  - Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS website or by calling 1-800-822-7967.    VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. How can I learn more?  - Ask your doctor.  - Contact your local or state health department.  - Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):        - Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO)    - Visit CDC's vaccines website)

NIHSeniorHealth_0000062_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Shingles ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/shingles/toc.html
Answer: Shingles is a painful rash that develops on one side of the face or body. The rash forms blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days and clear up within 2 to 4 weeks. Most commonly, the rash occurs in a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash occurs on one side of the face. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread and look similar to a chickenpox rash. Shingles is very common. Fifty percent of all Americans will have had shingles by the time they are 80. While shingles occurs in people of all ages, it is most common in 60- to 80-year-olds. In fact, one out of every three people 60 years or older will get shingles. (Watch the video to learn more about shingles. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) What Causes Shingles? Shingles is caused by a reactivation of the chickenpox virus. It is distinctive because it affects only one side of the body. The early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages: severe pain or tingling, possibly itchy rash, and blisters that look like chickenpox. The virus that causes shingles is a herpes virus, (Another name for shingles is herpes zoster.) Once you are infected with this kind of virus, it remains in your body for life. It stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. Shingles and Pain The most common complication of shingles is pain -- a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). People with PHN have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash, even after the rash clears up. In most patients, the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months, but some people can have pain from PHN for years. Persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. In fact, one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain. As people get older, they are more likely to develop long-term pain as a complication of shingles and the pain is likely to be more severe. Other Complications Shingles may also lead to other serious complications. - Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected.  -  Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring.  Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected. Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring. - In a very small number of cases, bacteria can cause more serious conditions, including toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection that destroys the soft tissue under the skin.  - The burning waves of pain, loss of sleep, and interference with even basic life activities can cause serious depression.  - In patients with immune deficiency, the rash can be much more extensive than usual and the illness can be complicated by pneumonia. These cases are more serious, but they are rarely fatal.  - Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death.

Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death. Shingles Usually Does Not Return People who develop shingles usually have only one episode in their lifetime. However, a person can have a second or even a third episode. The Shingles Vaccine Adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. The vaccine can reduce your risk of shingles and the long-term pain it can cause. If you have already had shingles or you have a chronic medical condition, you can receive the shingles vaccine. (See more about the shingles vaccine in the chapter Prevention.) Is Shingles Contagious? Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. If You Have Shingles If you have shingles, - keep the rash covered  - avoid touching or scratching the rash  - wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.  keep the rash covered avoid touching or scratching the rash wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus. Until your rash has developed crusts, avoid contact with - pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine  - premature or low birth weight infants  - people with weakened immune systems, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine premature or low birth weight infants people with weakened immune systems, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. If you have not had chickenpox and you come into contact with someone who has shingles, ask your healthcare provider whether you should get a chickenpox vaccination.

NINDS_0000148_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Shingles ?
URL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/shingles/shingles.htm
Answer: Shingles (herpes zoster) is an outbreak of rash or blisters on the skin that is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox  the varicella-zoster virus. The first sign of shingles is often burning or tingling pain (which can be severe), or sometimes numbness or itch,generally on one side of the body. After several days or a week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters, similar to chickenpox, appears in one area on one side of the body. Shingles pain can be mild or intense. Some people have mostly itching; some feel pain from the gentlest touch or breeze. The most common location for shingles is a band, called a dermatome, spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline. Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles. Scientists think that some of the virus particles from the original exposure to the varicella-zoster virus,leave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system. When the varicella-zoster virus reactivates, the virus moves back down the long nerve fibers that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin. The viruses multiply, the tell-tale rash erupts, and the person now has shingles.)

ADAM_0000787_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Child safety seats (Also called: Child car seats; Infant car seats; Car seats; Car safety seats)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000670.htm
Answer: Summary : Child safety seats are proven to save children's lives in accidents.  In the United States, all states require children to be secured in a car seat or booster seat until they are 4' 9"" tall. Most children grow to this height when they are between 8 and 12 years old.  To keep your child safe, keep these tips in mind when using a car safety seat.  - When your child is born, you must have a car seat to bring the baby home from the hospital.  - Always secure your child in a car seat whenever riding in a vehicle. Make sure the harness is fastened snugly.  - Read the car seat manufacturer's instructions for the proper way to use the seat. Read your vehicle owner's manual, too.  - Car seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. If there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. This can ONLY be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off.    When you are selecting a child safety seat for the first time:  - The seat must fit your child's size and be able to be properly installed in your vehicle.  - It is best to use a new car seat. Used car seats often do not have instructions. They may have cracks or other problems that make the seat unsafe. For example, the seat may have been damaged during a car accident.  - Try the seat before buying it. Install the seat in your vehicle. Put your child in the car seat. Secure the harness and buckle. Check that the seat fits your vehicle and child.  - DO NOT use a car seat past its expiration date. The seat frame may no longer be strong enough to support your child safely. The expiration date is usually on the bottom of the seat.  - DO NOT use a seat that has been recalled. Fill out and send in the registration card that comes with the new car seat. The manufacturer can contact you if the seat is recalled. You can find out about recalls by contacting the manufacturer, or by looking up safety complaints records on your child's safety seat at www.safercar.gov/parents/CarSeats/Car-Seat-Safety.htm.    The types of child safety seats and restraints include:  - Rear-facing seats  - Forward-facing seats  - Booster seats  - Car beds  - Built-in car seats  - Travel vests    REAR-FACING SEATS   A rear-facing seat is one in which your child faces the back of the vehicle. The seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle. The two types of rear-facing seats are the infant-only seat and the convertible seat.  Infant-only rear-facing seats. These seats are for babies who weigh up to 22 to 30 pounds, depending on the car seat. You will need a new seat when your child gets bigger. Infant-only seats have handles so you can carry the seat to and from the car. Some have a base you can leave installed in the car. This lets you click the car seat into place each time you use it. Follow manufacturer's instructions on how the seat should be reclined so your baby's head does not shift around while you are driving.  Convertible seats. These seats are to be placed in the rear-facing position and are for infants and toddlers. When your child is older and bigger, the seat can be switched to the forward-facing position. Experts recommend keeping your child rear-facing until at least age 2 and until your child outgrows the weight or height allowed by the seat.  FORWARD-FACING SEATS   A forward-facing seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle, although it allows your child to face the front of the car. These seats are used only after your child is too big for a rear-facing seat.  A combination forward-facing booster seat may also be used. For younger children, the booster seat's harness straps should be used. After your child reaches the upper height and weight limit for the harness (based on the seat's instructions), the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts can be used to keep your child strapped in.   BOOSTER SEATS  A booster seat raises your child up so the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts fit correctly. The lap belt should fall across your child's upper thighs. The shoulder belt should go across the middle of your child's shoulder and chest.  Use booster seats for older children until they are 4' 9"" tall and between 8 and 12 years old.  CAR BEDS  These seats are also called flat car seats. They are used for premature or other special-needs babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends having a health care provider look at how your preterm baby fits and breathes in a car seat before leaving the hospital.  BUILT-IN SEATS  Some vehicles have built-in car seats. Weight and height limits vary. You can get more details on these seats by reading the vehicle owner's manual or calling the vehicle manufacturer.  TRAVEL VESTS  Special vests can be worn by older children who have outgrown forward-facing safety seats. The vests can be used instead of booster seats. The vests are used with the vehicle's lap and seat belts. As with car seats, children should be sitting in the back seat when using the vest.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000869.htm
Answer: There are 2 types of contact dermatitis.  Irritant dermatitis: This is the most common type. It can be by contact with acids, alkaline materials such as soaps and detergents, fabric softeners, solvents, or other chemicals. The reaction most often looks like a burn. It is not caused by an allergy, but rather the skin's reaction to a very irritating substance.  Other materials that may irritate your skin include:  - Cement  - Hair dyes  - Long-term exposure to wet diapers  - Pesticides or weed killers  - Rubber gloves  - Shampoos    Allergic contact dermatitis: This form of the condition occurs when your skin comes in contact with a substance that causes you to have an allergic reaction.   Common allergens include:  - Adhesives, including those used for false eyelashes or toupees  - Antibiotics, such as neomycin rubbed on the surface of the skin  - Balsam of Peru (used in many personal products and cosmetics, as well as in many foods and drinks)  - Fabrics and clothing  - Fragrances in perfumes, cosmetics, soaps, and moisturizers  - Nail polish, hair dyes, and permanent wave solutions  - Nickel or other metals (found in jewelry, watch straps, metal zips, bra hooks, buttons, pocketknives, lipstick holders, and powder compacts)  - Poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and other plants  - Rubber or latex gloves or shoes    You will not have a reaction to a substance when you are first exposed to the substance. However, you will form a reaction after future exposures. You may become more sensitive and develop a reaction if you use it regularly. The reaction most often occurs 24 to 48 hours after the exposure.   Some products cause a reaction only when the skin is also exposed to sunlight (photosensitivity). These include:  - Shaving lotions  - Sunscreens  - Sulfa ointments  - Some perfumes  - Coal tar products  - Oil from the skin of a lime    A few airborne allergens, such as ragweed or insecticide spray, can also cause contact dermatitis.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000869.htm
Answer: Symptoms vary depending on the cause and whether the dermatitis is due to an allergic reaction or an irritant. The same person may also have different symptoms over time.  Allergic reactions may occur suddenly, or develop after months of exposure.   Contact dermatitis often occurs on the hands. Hair products, cosmetics, and perfumes can lead to skin reactions on the face, head, and neck. Jewelry can also cause skin problems in the area under it.  Itching is a common symptom. In the case of an allergic dermatitis, itching can be severe.   You may have red, streaky, or patchy rash where the substance touched the skin. The allergic reaction is often delayed so that the rash may not appear until 24 to 48 hours after exposure.   The rash may:  - Have red bumps that may form moist, weeping blisters  - Feel warm and tender  - Ooze, drain, or crust  - Become scaly, raw, or thickened    Dermatitis caused by an irritant may also cause burning or pain as well as itching. Irritant dermatitis often shows as dry, red, and rough skin. Cuts (fissures) may form on the hands. Skin may become inflamed with long-term exposure.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000869.htm
Answer: Your health care provider will make the diagnosis based on how the skin looks and by asking questions about substances you may have come in contact with.  Allergy testing with skin patches (called patch testing) may determine what is causing the reaction. Patch testing is used for certain people who have long-term or repeated contact dermatitis. It requires 3 office visits and must be done by a provider with the skill to interpret the results correctly.   - On the first visit, small patches of possible allergens are applied to the skin. These patches are removed 48 hours later to see if a reaction has occurred.  - A third visit, about 2 days later, is done to look for any delayed reaction.  - If you have already tested a material on a small area of your skin and noticed a reaction, you should bring the material with you.    Other tests may be used to rule out other possible causes, including skin lesion biopsy or culture of the skin lesion.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000869.htm
Answer: Your doctor will recommend treatment based on what is causing the problem. In some cases, the best treatment is to do nothing to the area.  Often, treatment includes washing the area with a lot of water to get rid of any traces of the irritant that are still on the skin. You should avoid further exposure to the substance.  Emollients or moisturizers help keep the skin moist, and also help skin repair itself. They protect the skin from becoming inflamed again. They are a key part of preventing and treating contact dermatitis.  Topical corticosteroids are medicines used to treat eczema.  - Topical means you place it on the skin. You will be prescribed a cream or ointment. Topical corticosteroids may also be called topical steroids or topical cortisones.  - DO NOT use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor advises you to use it.    Your provider may also prescribe other creams or ointments, such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus, to use on the skin.  In severe cases, you may need to take corticosteroid pills. Your provider will start you on a high dose and your dose will be slowly reduced over about 12 days. You may also receive a corticosteroid shot.  Wet dressings and soothing anti-itch (antipruritic) lotions may be recommended to reduce other symptoms.)

ADAM_0001041_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Crying - excessive (0 to 6 months) (Also called: Excessive crying (infants 0 to 6 months))
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003023.htm
Answer: Summary : Infants normally cry about 1 to 3 hours a day. It is perfectly normal for an infant to cry when hungry, thirsty, tired, lonely, or in pain. It is also normal for a baby to have a fussy period in the evening.  But, if an infant cries too often, it may be a sign of something that needs treatment.

Causes : Infants may cry because of any of the following:  - Boredom or loneliness  - Colic  - Discomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or feeling cold  - Hunger or thirst  - Illness  - Infection (a likely cause if the crying is accompanied by irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, or fever. You should call your baby's health care provider)  - Medicines  - Normal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep  - Pain  - Teething

Home Care : Home care depends on the causes. Follow your provider's advice.   If the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.  If crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.  Take your baby's temperature to check for fever. Check your baby head-to-toe for any injuries. Pay particular attention to the fingers, toes, and genitalia. It is not uncommon for a hair to get wrapped around part of your baby, such as a toe, creating pain.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Call the provider if:  - A baby's excessive crying remains unexplained and does not go away in 1 day, despite attempts at home treatment  - The baby has other symptoms, such as fever, along with the excessive crying

What to Expect at Your Office Visit : The provider will examine your baby and ask about the child's medical history and symptoms. Questions may include:  - Is the child teething?  - Is the child bored, lonely, hungry, thirsty?  - Does the child seem to have a lot of gas?  - What other symptoms does the child have? Such as, difficulty waking up, fever, irritability, poor appetite, or vomiting?    The provider will check the infant's growth and development. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the baby has a bacterial infection.)

ADAM_0001562_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Feeding patterns and diet - children 6 months to 2 years
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000713.htm
Answer: Summary : An age-appropriate diet:  - Gives your child proper nutrition  - Is right for your child's state of development  - Can help prevent childhood obesity

Recommendations : 6 to 8 MONTHS  At this age, your baby will probably eat about 4 to 6 times per day, but will eat more at each feeding than the first 6 months.  - If you feed formula, your baby will eat about 6 to 8 ounces per feeding, but should not have more than 32 ounces in 24 hours.  - You can start to introduce solid foods at age 6 months. Most of your baby's calories should still come from breast milk or formula.  - Breast milk is not a good source of iron. So after 6 months, your baby will start to need more iron in their diet. Start solid feedings with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula. Mix it with enough milk so that the texture is very thin. Start by offering the cereal 2 times a day, in just a few spoonfuls.  - You can make the mixture thicker as your baby learns to control it in her mouth.  - You can also introduce iron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables. Try green peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, pears, bananas, and peaches.  - Some dietitians recommend introducing a few vegetables before fruits. The sweetness of fruit may make some vegetables less appealing.  - The amount your child eats will vary between 2 tablespoons and 2 cups of fruits and vegetables per day. How much your child eats depends on their size and how well they eat fruits and vegetables.    There are several ways you can tell that your baby is ready to eat solid foods:  - Your baby's birth weight has doubled.  - Your baby can control their head and neck movements.  - Your baby can sit up with some support.  - Your baby can show you they are full by turning their head away or by not opening their mouth.  - Your baby begins showing interest in food when others are eating.    You should also know:  - Never give honey to your baby. It may contain bacteria that can cause botulism, a rare but serious illness.  - DO NOT give your baby cow's milk until they are 1 year old. Babies under age 1 have a difficult time digesting cow's milk.  - Never put your child to bed with a bottle. This can cause tooth decay. If your baby wants to suck, give them a pacifier.  - Use a small spoon when feeding your baby.  - It is fine to start to give your baby water between feedings.  - DO NOT give your baby cereal in a bottle unless your pediatrician or dietitian recommends it, for example, for reflux.  - Only offer your child new foods when they are hungry.  - Introduce new foods one at a time, waiting 2 to 3 days between. That way you can watch for allergic reactions. Signs of an allergy include diarrhea, rash, or vomiting.  - Avoid foods with added salt or sugar.  - Feed your baby directly from the jar only if you use the entire jar contents. Otherwise, use a dish to prevent food-borne illness.  - Opened containers of baby's food should be covered and stored in a refrigerator for no longer than 2 days.    8 to 12 MONTHS OF AGE  At this age, you can offer finger foods in small amounts. Your baby will probably let you know they are ready to start feeding themselves by grabbing the food or spoon with their hand.  Good finger foods include:  - Soft cooked vegetables  - Washed and peeled fruits  - Graham crackers  - Melba toast  - Noodles    You can also introduce teething foods, such as:  - Toast strips  - Unsalted crackers and bagels  - Teething biscuits    Continue to offer your baby breast milk or formula 3 to 4 times per day at this age.  You should also know:  - Avoid foods that may cause choking, such as apple chunks or slices, grapes, berries, raisins, dry flake cereals, hot dogs, sausages, peanut butter, popcorn, nuts, seeds, round candies, and raw vegetables.  - You can give your child egg yolks 3 to 4 times per week. Some babies are sensitive to egg whites. So DO NOT offer them until after age 1.  - You can offer small amounts of cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt, but no cow's milk.  - By age 1, most children are off the bottle. If your child still uses a bottle, it should contain water only.    1 YEARof AGE  - At this age, you may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula.  - Most mothers in the U.S. wean their babies by this age. But it is also fine to continue to nurse if you and your baby want to.  - DO NOT give your child low-fat milk (2%, 1%, or skim) until after age 2. Your baby needs the extra calories from fat to grow and develop.  - At this age, your baby will get most of their nutrition from proteins, fruits and vegetables, breads and grains, and dairy. You can make sure your baby gets all the vitamins and minerals they need by offering a variety of foods.  - Your child will start to crawl and walk and be much more active. They will eat smaller amounts at a time, but will eat more often (4 to 6 times a day). Having snacks on hand is a good idea.  - At this age, their growing slows. They will not double in size like they did when they were an infant.    You should also know:  - If your child dislikes a new food, try giving it again later. Often it takes several tries for children to take to new foods.  - DO NOT give your child sweets or sweetened beverages. They can spoil their appetite and cause tooth decay.  - Avoid salt, strong spices, and caffeine products, including soft drinks, coffee, tea, and chocolate.  - If your baby is fussy, they may need attention, rather than food.    2 YEARS of AGE  - After your child turns 2, your child's diet should be moderately low in fat. A high-fat diet can lead to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems later in life.  - Your child should eat a variety of foods from each of the food groups: breads and grains, proteins, fruits and vegetables, and dairy.  - If your water is not fluoridated, it is a good idea to use toothpaste or mouthwash with fluoride added.    All children need plenty of calcium to support their growing bones. But not all kids get enough. Good sources of calcium include:  - Low-fat or nonfat milk, yogurt, and cheese  - Cooked greens  - Canned salmon (with bones)    If your child's diet is balanced and healthy, they should not need a vitamin supplement. Some kids are picky eaters, but usually they still get all the nutrients they need. If you are concerned, ask your health care provider whether your child needs a children's multivitamin.

When to Call Your Child's Health Care Provider : Call the provider if you are concerned your child:  - Is not eating enough  - Is eating too much  - Is gaining too much or too little weight  - Has an allergic reaction to food)

ADAM_0003454_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Saline nasal washes (Also called: Salt water washes; Nasal irrigation; Nasal lavage; Sinusitis - nasal wash)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000801.htm
Answer: Summary : A saline nasal wash helps flush pollen, dust, and other debris from your nasal passages. It also helps remove excess mucus (snot) and adds moisture. Your nasal passages are open spaces behind your nose. Air passes through your nasal passages before entering your lungs.   Nasal washes can help relieve nasal allergy symptoms and help prevent sinus infections (sinusitis).

How to use Saline Nasal Washes : You can buy a device such as a neti pot, squeeze bottle, or rubber nasal bulb at your drug store. You can also buy saline solution made specifically for nasal rinses. Or, you can make your own rinse by mixing:  - 3 teaspoons (tsp) canning or pickling salt (no iodine)  - 1 tsp baking soda  - 1 cup warm distilled, filtered, or boiled water    To use the wash:  - Fill the device with half the saline solution.  - Keeping your head over a sink or in the shower, tilt your head sideways to the left. Breathe through your open mouth.  - Gently pour or squeeze the solution into your right nostril. The water should come out the left nostril.  - You can adjust the tilt of your head to keep the solution from going into your throat or into your ears.  - Repeat on the other side.  - Gently blow your nose to remove remaining water and mucus.

Important Tips : You should:  - Be sure you only use distilled, boiled, or filtered water. While rare, some tap water may contain small germs that can cause infection.  - Always clean the neti pot or nasal bulb with distilled, boiled, or filtered water after every use and let it dry.  - Use the nasal wash before using other medicines, such as a nasal spray. This will help your nasal passages better absorb the medicine.  - It may take a few attempts to learn the technique of washing your nasal passages. You also may feel a slight burn at first, which should go away. If needed, use a little less salt in your saline solution.  - DO NOT use if your nasal passages are completely blocked.

When to Call the Doctor : Be sure to call your health care provider if you notice:  - Nosebleeds  - Fever  - Pain  - Headaches)

GHR_0000531_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome ? (Also called: duplication/inversion 15q11; idic(15); inv dup(15); inverted duplication 15; isodicentric chromosome 15; non-distal tetrasomy 15q)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/isodicentric-chromosome-15-syndrome
Answer: Isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome is a developmental disorder with a broad spectrum of features. The signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals.  Poor muscle tone is commonly seen in individuals with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome and contributes to delayed development and impairment of motor skills, including sitting and walking.  Babies with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome often have trouble feeding due to weak facial muscles that impair sucking and swallowing; many also have backflow of acidic stomach contents into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux). These feeding problems may make it difficult for them to gain weight.  Intellectual disability in isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome can range from mild to profound. Speech is usually delayed and often remains absent or impaired. Behavioral difficulties often associated with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome include hyperactivity, anxiety, and frustration leading to tantrums. Other behaviors resemble features of autistic spectrum disorders, such as repeating the words of others (echolalia), difficulty with changes in routine, and problems with social interaction.  About two-thirds of people with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome have seizures. In more than half of affected individuals, the seizures begin in the first year of life.  About 40 percent of individuals with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome are born with eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Hearing loss in childhood is common and is usually caused by fluid buildup in the middle ear. This hearing loss is often temporary. However, if left untreated during early childhood, the hearing loss can interfere with language development and worsen the speech problems associated with this disorder.  Other problems associated with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome in some affected individuals include minor genital abnormalities in males such as undescended testes (cryptorchidism) and a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis).)

ADAM_0000346_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Asymptomatic HIV infection ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000682.htm
Answer: Asymptomatic HIV infection is a phase of HIV/AIDS during which there are no symptoms of HIV infection.   During this phase, the immune system in someone with HIV slowly deteriorates, but the person has no symptoms. How long this phase lasts depends on how quickly the HIV virus copies itself, and how the person's genes affect the way the body handles the virus.  Some people can go 10 years or longer without symptoms. Others may have symptoms and worsening immune function within a few years after the original infection.)

ADAM_0003494_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Screening and diagnosis for HIV ? (Also called: HIV testing; HIV screening; HIV screening test; HIV confirmatory test)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003538.htm
Answer: In general, testing for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a 2-step process that involves a screening test and follow-up tests.  SCREENING TESTS  These are tests that check if you've been infected with HIV. The most common tests are described below.  An antibody test (also called immunoassay) checks for antibodiesto the HIV virus. Your health care provider may order the test for you to have done at a lab. Or, you may have it done at a testing center or use a home kit. These tests can detect antibodies starting a few weeks after youre infected with the virus. Antibody tests can be done using:  - Blood -- This test is done by drawing blood from a vein, or by a finger prick. A blood test is the most accurate because blood has a higher level of antibodies than other body fluids.  - Oral fluid -- This test checks for antibodies in the cells of the mouth. It is done by swabbing the gums and inside cheeks. This test is less accurate than the blood test.  - Urine -- This test checks for antibodies in the urine. This test is also less accurate than the blood test.   An antigen test checks your blood for an HIV antigen, called p24. When you're first infected with HIV, and before your body has a chance to make antibodies to the virus, your blood has a high level of p24. The p24 antigen test is accurate 11 days to 1 month after getting infected. This test is usually not used by itself to screen for HIV infection.  An antibody-antigen blood test checks for levels of both HIV antibodies and the p24 antigen. This test can detect the virus as early as 3 weeks after getting infected.  FOLLOW-UP TESTS  A follow-up test is also called a confirmatory test. It is usually done when the screening test is positive. Several kinds of tests may be used to:  - Detect the virus itself  - Detect antibodies more accurately than screening tests  - Tell the difference between the 2 types of virus, HIV-1 and HIV-2)

Answer: With the blood test, veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling lightheaded  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)   There are no risks with the oral swab and urine tests.)

ADAM_0000140_Sec2.txt,"Question: What is (are) Alcohol use and safe drinking ? (Also called: Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001944.htm
Answer: Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.  TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50 -- coma  - 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death    You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.  HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL  Alcohol increases the risk of:  - Alcoholism  - Falls, drownings, and other accidents  - Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers  - Motor vehicle accidents  - Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  - Suicide and homicide    Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.  RESPONSIBLE DRINKING  If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.  Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:  - Never drink alcohol and drive a car.  - If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.  - Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.    If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.  If alcohol use runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.  CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:  - You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member  - You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use or support groups  - You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking    Other resources include:  - Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups  - Local hospitals  - Public or private mental health agencies  - School or work counselors  - Student or employee health centers)

ADAM_0001279_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Drinking water safely during cancer treatment
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000060.htm
Answer: Summary : During and right after your cancer treatment, your body cannot protect itself against infections. Tiny germs can be in water, even when it looks clean. You need to be careful where you get your water from. This includes water for drinking, cooking, and brushing your teeth. Ask your doctor or nurse about special care you should take.

Tap water : Tap water is water from your faucet. It should be safe when it comes from:  - A city water supply  - A city well that supplies many people with water    If you live in a small city or town, check with your local water department. Ask if they test the water every day for the kind of germs that can give you an infection -- germs are called coliforms.

Well water : Boil water from a private well or a small community well before you drink it or use it for cooking or brushing your teeth.  Running well water through a filter or adding chlorine to it does not make it safe to use. Test your well water at least once a year for coliform germs that may cause an infection. Test your water more often if coliforms are found in it or if there is any question about the safety of your water.  To boil water and store it:  - Heat the water to a rolling boil.  - Keep the water boiling for at least 1 minute.  - After boiling the water, store it in the refrigerator in a clean and covered container.  - Use all this water within 3 days (72 hours). If you do not use it in this time, pour it down the drain or use it to water your plants or your garden.

Bottled water : The label on any bottled water you drink should say how it was cleaned. Look for these words:  - Reverse osmosis filtration  - Distillation or distilled

Water filters : Tap water should be safe when it comes from a city water supply or a city well that supplies many people with water. It does not need to be filtered.  You should boil water that comes from a private well or a small local well, even if you have a filter.  Many sink filters, filters in refrigerators, pitchers that use filters, and some filters for camping do not remove germs.  If you have a home water-filtering system (such as a filter under your sink), change the filter as often as the manufacturer recommends.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001930.htm
Answer: Summary : Learning to drive is an exciting time for teenagers and their parents. It opens up many options for a young person, but it also carries risks. Young people between ages 15 and 24 have the highest rate of auto-related deaths. The rate is the highest for young men.   Parents and teens should be aware of problem areas and take steps to avoid hazards.

Information : Make a Commitment to Safety  Teens also need to commit to being safe and responsible drivers in order to improve the odds in their favor.  - Reckless driving is still a danger to teens -- even with automobile safety features.  - All new drivers should take a driver's education course. These courses can reduce risk for crashes.    Drivers and passengers should use automobile safety features at all times. These include: seat belts, shoulder straps, and headrests. Only drive cars that have air bags, padded dashes, safety glass, collapsible steering columns, and anti-lock brakes.  Auto accidents are also a leading cause of death in infants and children. Infants and young children should be properly buckled into a child safety seat of the right size that is correctly installed in the vehicle.  Avoid Distracted Driving   Distractions are a problem for all drivers. Do not use cell phones for talking, texting, or email when you are driving.   - Mobile phones should be turned off when driving so you are not tempted to make calls, send or read texts, or answer the phone.  - If phones are left on for emergency use, pull off of the road before answering or texting.    Other tips include:  - Avoid putting on makeup while driving, even when stopped at a light or stop sign, it can be dangerous.  - Finish eating before starting your car and driving.    Driving with friends can lead to accidents.  - Teens are safer driving alone or with family. For the first 6 months, teens should drive with an adult driver who can help them learn good driving habits.  - New drivers should wait at least 3 to 6 months before taking friends as passengers.    Teenage-related driving deaths occur more often in certain conditions.  Other safety tips for teens  - Reckless driving is still a danger, even when using seatbelts. Do not rush. It is safer to be late.  - Avoid driving at nighttime. Your driving skills and reflexes are just developing during the first months of driving. Darkness adds an extra factor to cope with.  - When drowsy, stop driving until fully alert. Sleepiness may cause more accidents than alcohol.  - Never drink and drive. Drinking slows reflexes and hurts judgment. These effects happen to anyone who drinks. So, NEVER drink and drive. ALWAYS find someone to drive who has not been drinking -- even if this means making an uncomfortable phone call.  - Drugs can be just as dangerous as alcohol. Do not mix driving with marijuana, other illegal drugs or any prescribedmedicine that makes you sleepy.   Parents should talk with their teens about ""household driving rules.""  - Make a written ""driving contract"" that both parents and teens sign.  - The contract should include a list of driving rules and what teens can expect if the rules are broken.  - The contract should state that parents have the final say about the driving rules.  - When writing the contract, take into account all of the driving issues that are likely to come up.    Parents can do the following to help prevent teens from drinking and driving:  - Tell their teens to call rather than get in a car with a driver who has been drinking or when they have been drinking. Promise no punishment if they call first.    Some children continue to mix driving and drinking. In many states, the parent must sign for a teenager under 18 to get a driver's license. At any time before the 18th birthday a parent can refuse responsibility and the state will take the license.)

ADAM_0003451_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Safe eating during cancer treatment
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000061.htm
Answer: Summary : When you have cancer, you need good nutrition to help keep your body strong. To do this you need to watch the foods you eat and how you prepare them.  Some raw foods can contain germs that can hurt you when cancer or treatment weakens your immune system. Ask your doctor or nurse about how to eat well but safely.  When you eat eggs:  - Yolks and whites should be cooked solid. Do not eat runny eggs.  - Do not eat foods that may have raw eggs in them (such as Caesar salad dressing, cookie dough, cake batter, and hollandaise sauce).    Be careful when you have dairy products:  - All milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy should have the word pasteurized on their containers.  - Do not eat soft cheeses or cheeses with blue veins (such as Brie, Camembert, Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola, and Bleu).  - Do not eat Mexican-style cheeses (such as queso blanco fresco and cojita).    Fruits and vegetables:  - Wash all raw fruits, vegetables, and fresh herbs with cold running water.  - Do not eat raw vegetable sprouts (such as alfalfa and mung bean).  - Do not use fresh salsa or salad dressings that are kept in the refrigerated cases of the grocery store.  - Drink only juice that says pasteurized on the container.    Do not eat raw honey. Eat only heat-treated honey. Avoid sweets that have creamy fillings.

Cook foods safely : When you cook, make sure you cook your food long enough.  Do not eat uncooked tofu. Cook tofu for at least 5 minutes.  When eating chicken and other poultry:  - Cook whole pieces of poultry to 180 F.  - Cook ground poultry to 165 F.    If you cook beef, lamb, pork, or venison:  - Do not eat raw mean, such as Japanese sashimi.  - Make sure meat is not red or pink before you eat it.  - Cook meat to 160 F.    When eating fish, oysters, and other shellfish:  - Do not eat raw fish (such as sushi), raw oysters, or any other raw shellfish.  - Make sure all fish and shellfish you eat is cooked thoroughly.    Heat all casseroles to 165 F. Warm hot dogs and lunch meats to steaming before you eat them.

Be careful when you eat out : When you dine out, stay away from:  - Raw fruits and vegetables  - Salad bars, buffets, sidewalk vendors, potlucks, and delis    Ask if all fruit juices are pasteurized.  Use only salad dressings, sauces, and salsas from single-serving packages. Eat out at times when restaurants are less crowded. Always ask for your food to be prepared fresh, even at fast food restaurants.)

ADAM_0003452_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Safe sex
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001949.htm
Answer: Summary : Safe sex means taking steps before and during sex that can prevent you from getting an infection, or from giving an infection to your partner.

Information : A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that can be spread to another person through sexual contact. STIs include:  - Chlamydia  - Genital herpes  - Genital warts  - Gonorrhea  - Hepatitis  - HIV  - HPV  - Syphilis    STIs are also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  These infections are spread by direct contact with a sore on the genitals or mouth, body fluids, or sometimes the skin around the genital area.  Before having sex:  - Get to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories  - Don't feel forced into having sex  - Don't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner    Your sexual partner should be someone who you know does not have any STI. Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs and share the test results with each other.  If you know you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know this before you have sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.  Use condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.  - The condom should be in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.  - Keep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with skin areas around the genitals. A condom reduces but does not eliminate your risk of getting an STI.    Other tips include:   - Use lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.  - Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.  - Polyurethane condoms are less likely to break than latex condoms, but they cost more.  - Using condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may increase the chance of HIV transmission.  - Stay sober. Alcohol and drugs impair your judgment. When you are not sober, you might not choose your partner as carefully. You may also forget to use condoms, or use them incorrectly.    Get tested regularly for STIs if you have new sexual partners. Most STIs have no symptoms, so you need to be tested often if there is any chance you have been exposed. You will have the best outcome and will be less likely to spread the infection if you are diagnosed early.  Women should consider getting the HPV vaccine to keep from getting the human papillomavirus. This virus can put you at risk for vaginal warts and cervical cancer.)

ADAM_0003804_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Swan-Ganz - right heart catheterization (Also called: Right heart catheterization; Catheterization - right heart)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003870.htm
Answer: Summary : Swan-Ganz catheterization is the passing of a thin tube (catheter) into the right side of the heart and the arteries leading to the lungs. It is done to monitor the heart's function and blood flow. This test is most often done in persons who are very ill.

How the Test is Performed : The test can be done while you are in bed in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital or in special procedure areas such as a cardiac catheterization laboratory.  Before the test starts, you may be given medicine (sedative) to help you relax.  You will lie on a padded table. Your doctor will make a small surgical cut near the groin or in your neck. A flexible tube (catheter or sheath) is placed through the cut into a vein. Sometimes, it will be placed in your arm. You will be awake during the procedure.  A larger catheter is inserted and carefully moved into the upper chamber of the right side of the heart. X-ray images may be used to help the health care provider see where the catheter should be placed.  Blood may be removed from the catheter to measure the amount of oxygen in the blood.  During the procedure, your heart's rhythm will be constantly watched using an electrocardiogram (ECG).

How to Prepare for the Test : You should not eat or drink anything for 8 hours before the test starts. You may need to stay in the hospital the night before the test. Otherwise, you will check in to the hospital the morning of the test.   You will wear a hospital gown. You must sign a consent form before the test. Your health care provider will explain the procedure and its risks.

How the Test will Feel : You may be given medicine to help you relax before the procedure. You will be awake and able to follow instructions during the test.  You may feel some discomfort when the IV is placed into your arm. You may also feel some pressure at the site when the catheter is inserted. In people who are critically ill, the catheter may stay in place for several days.  You may feel discomfort when the area of the vein is numbed with anesthetic.

Why the Test is Performed : The procedure is done to evaluate how the blood moves (circulates) in people who have:  - Abnormal pressures in the heart arteries  - Burns  - Congenital heart disease  - Heart failure  - Kidney disease  - Leaky heart valves (valvular regurgitation)  - Shock   It may also be done to monitor for complications of heart attack and to see how well certain heart medicines are working.  Swan-Ganz catheterization can also be used to detect abnormal blood flow between two areas of the heart that are not normally connected.   Conditions that can also be diagnosed or evaluated with Swan-Ganz catheterization include:  - Cardiac tamponade  - Pulmonary hypertension  - Restrictive cardiomyopathy

Normal Results : - Cardiac index is 2.8 to 4.2 liters per minute per square meter (of body surface area)  - Pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 17 to 32 millimeters of mercury (mmHg)  - Pulmonary artery mean pressure is 9 to 19 mmHg  - Pulmonary diastolic pressure is 4 to 13 mmHg  - Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is 4 to 12 mmHg  - Right atrial pressure is 0 to 7 mmHg

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may be due to:  - Blood flow problems, such as heart failure or shock  - Heart valve disease  - Lung disease  - Structural problems with the heart, such as a septal defect

Risks : Risks of the procedure include:  - Bruising around the area where the catheter was inserted  - Injury to the vein  - Puncture to the lung if the neck or chest veins are used, causing lung collapse (pneumothorax)   Very rare complications include:  - Cardiac arrhythmias requiring treatment   - Cardiac tamponade  - Embolism caused by blood clots at the tip of the catheter  - Infection  - Low blood pressure)

ADAM_0003842_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Taking multiple medicines safely
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000883.htm
Answer: Summary : If you take more than one medicine, it is important to take them carefully and safely. Some medicines can interact and cause side effects. It can also be hard to keep track of when and how to take each medicine.  Here are tips to help you keep track of your medicines and take them as directed.

Why you may Need More Than one Medicine : You may take more than one medicine to treat a single condition. Or you may take different medicines to treat more than one health problem. For example, you may take a statin to lower your cholesterol, and a beta-blocker to control your blood pressure.   Older adults often have more than one health condition. So they are more likely to take several medicines.

Risks of Taking Multiple Medicines : The more medicines you take, the more you need to use them carefully. There are several risks when taking multiple medicines.  - You may be more likely to have side effects. Because most medicines can have side effects, the more medicines you take, the more likely you will have side effects. Taking certain medicines can also increase the risk of falls.  - You are at higher risk for drug interactions. An interaction is when one medicine affects how another medicine works. For example, taken together, one medicine may make the other medicine stronger. Medicines can also interact with alcohol and even some foods. Some interactions can be serious, even life threatening.  - You may find it hard to keep track of when to take each medicine. You even may forget which medicine you have taken at a certain time.  - You may take a medicine you do not need. This may be more likely to happen if you see more than one health care provider. You may be prescribed different medicines for the same problem.

People at Higher Risk : Certain people are more likely to have problems from taking multiple medicines:  - People who are prescribed 5 or more medicines. The more medicines you take, the higher the chance of interactions or side effects. You may also find it hard to remember all possible drug interactions.  - People who take medicines prescribed by more than one provider. One provider may not know that you are taking medicines another provider has given you.  - Older adults. As you age, your body processes medicines differently. For instance, your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. This can mean that more medicine stays in your body for longer. This can lead to dangerous levels of medicines in your system.  - People in the hospital. When you are in the hospital, you will likely see new providers who are not familiar with your health history. Without this knowledge, they may prescribe a medicine that may interact with medicines you already take.

What you can do : These suggestions can help you take all of your medicines safely:  - Keep a list of all medicines you take. Your list should include all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. OTC medicines include vitamins, supplements, and herbal products. Keep a copy of the list in your wallet and at home.  - Review your medicine list with your health care providers and pharmacists. Discuss the list with your provider each time you have an appointment. Ask your provider if you still need to take all of the medicines on your list. Also ask if any of the dosages should be changed. Make sure you give all of your providers a copy of your medicine list.  - Ask questions about any new drugs you are prescribed. Make sure you understand how to take them. Also ask if a new medicine could interact with any of the medicines or supplements you are already taking.  - Take your medicines exactly as your provider tells you. If you have questions about how or why to take your medicine, ask your provider. DO NOT skip doses, or stop taking your medicines.  - If you notice side effects, tell your health care provider. DO NOT stop taking your medicines unless your provider tells you to.  - Keep your medicines organized. There are many ways to keep track of your medicines. A pill organizer may help. Try one or more methods and see what works for you.  - If you have a hospital stay, bring your medicine list with you. Talk with your provider about medicine safety while you are in the hospital.

When to Call the Doctor : Call if you have questions or you are confused about the directions for your medicine. Call if you have any side effects from your medicines. DO NOT stop taking any medicine unless your health care provider tells you to stop.)

ADAM_0004154_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Using over-the-counter medicines safely
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm
Answer: Summary : Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are drugs you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using OTC the medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.  Here is what you need to know about OTC drugs.

About OTC Medicines : You can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:  - Drug stores  - Grocery stores  - Discount and department stores  - Convenience stores  - Some gas stations    When used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:  - Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea  - Preventing problems like heartburn or motion sickness  - Treating conditions such as athletes foot, allergies, or migraine headaches  - Providing first aid

When Should you Use OTC Medicines : It is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:  - Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition  - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take  - What side effects or problems to watch for    Your pharmacist can answer questions such as:  - What the medicine will do  - How it should be stored  - Whether another medicine might work as well or better

What the Label can Tell you : You can also get information about OTC drugs on the medicine label.  Most OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.  Here is what the label will show you:  - Active Ingredient. This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose.  - Uses. The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, DO NOT use the medicine for any condition not listed.  - Warnings. Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. Some medicines you should not take when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose.  - Directions. The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Fully read the directions, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages.  - Other information. This includes such things as how to store the medicine.  - Inactive ingredients. Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.    The label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.

Other Ways to Use OTC Medicines Safely : You should:  - Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with.  - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place you bought it.  - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container.  - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.    Also be sure to take steps to keep kids safe. You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight.)

ADAM_0002064_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Hydrogen peroxide poisoning
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002652.htm
Answer: Summary : Hydrogen peroxide is a liquid commonly used to fight germs. Hydrogen peroxide poisoning occurs when large amounts of the liquid are swallowed or get in the lungs or eyes.  This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual overdose. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poisonous Ingredient : Hydrogen peroxide can be poisonous if it is not used correctly.

Where Found : Hydrogen peroxide is used in these products:  - Hydrogen peroxide  - Hair bleach  - Some contact lens cleaners   Note: Household hydrogen peroxide has a 3% concentration. That means it contains 97% water and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Hair bleaches are stronger. They usually have a concentration of more than 6%. Some industrial-strength solutions contain more than 10% hydrogen peroxide.

Symptoms : Symptoms of a hydrogen peroxide poisoning include:  - Abdominal pain and cramping  - Breathing difficulty (if large concentrations are swallowed)  - Body aches  - Burns in the mouth and throat (if swallowed)  - Chest pain  - Eye burns (if it gets in the eyes)  - Seizures (rare)  - Stomach swelling  - Temporary white color to the skin  - Vomiting (sometimes with blood)

Home Care : Seek medical help right away. Do NOT make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to do so. If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.

Before Calling Emergency : Have this information ready:  - Person's age, weight, and condition  - Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)  - Time it was swallowed or got into eyes or on skin  - Amount swallowed, in eyes, or on skin

Poison Control : Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room : Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.  The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.  The person may receive:  - Blood and urine tests  - Chest x-ray  - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)  - Fluids through a vein (by IV)  - Medicines to treat symptoms  - Tube down the throat into the stomach (gastric tube) to relieve gas pressure

Outlook (Prognosis) : Most contact with household-strength hydrogen peroxide is fairly harmless. Exposure to industrial-strength hydrogen peroxide can be dangerous. Passing a tube with a camera through the mouth into the stomach (endoscopy) may be required to stop internal bleeding.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001135.htm
Answer: Severe breathing problems almost always develop shortly after the baby is born. This is due in part to poor movement of the diaphragm muscle and crowding of the lung tissue. Problems with breathing and oxygen levels are often due to underdeveloped lung tissue and blood vessels as well.  Other symptoms include:  - Bluish colored skin due to lack of oxygen  - Rapid breathing (tachypnea)  - Fast heart rate (tachycardia))

ADAM_0001206_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Diaphragmatic hernia repair - congenital
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002936.htm
Answer: Summary : Diaphragmatic hernia repair is surgery to correct an opening or space in a baby's diaphragm. This opening is called a hernia. It is a rare type of birth defect. (Congenital means the problem is present at birth.)

Description : Before this surgery, nearly all infants need a breathing device to improve their oxygen levels.  The surgery is done while your child is under general anesthesia (asleep and not able to feel pain). The surgeon makes a cut (incision) in the belly under the upper ribs. This allows the organs in the area to be reached. The surgeon gently pulls these organs down into place through the opening in the diaphragm and into the abdominal cavity.  The surgeon repairs the hole in the diaphragm. If the hole is small, it may be repaired with stitches. In most cases, a piece of plastic patch is used to cover the hole.

Why the Procedure is Performed : The diaphragm is a muscle. It is important for breathing. It separates the chest cavity (where the heart and lungs are) from the belly area.   In a child born with a diaphragmatic hernia, the diaphragm muscle is not completely formed. So, organs from the belly (stomach, spleen, liver, and intestines) may go up into the chest cavity where the lungs are. This prevents the lung(s) from growing normally. The lungs stay too small for babies to breathe on their own when they are born.   A diaphragmatic hernia can be life-threatening. Surgery to repair it must be done in the first few days or weeks of a child's life.

Risks : Risks for this surgery include:   - Breathing problems, which may be severe  - Bleeding  - Collapsed lung  - Lung problems that do not go away  - Infection  - Reactions to medicines

Before the Procedure : Infants with a diaphragmatic hernia are admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). It may be days or weeks before the baby is stable enough for surgery.  - In the NICU, your baby will probably need a breathing machine (mechanical ventilator) before the surgery. This helps the baby breathe.  - If your child is very sick, a heart-lung bypass machine (ECMO) may be needed to do the work of the heart and lungs.  - Before surgery, your baby will have x-rays and regular blood tests to see how well the lungs are working. A light sensor (called a pulse oximeter) is taped to baby's skin to monitor the oxygen level in the blood.  - Your baby may be given medicines to control blood pressure and keep him or her comfortable.    Your baby will have tubes placed:  - From the mouth or nose to the stomach to keep air out of the stomach  - In an artery to monitor blood pressure  - In a vein to deliver nutrients and medicines

After the Procedure : Your baby will be on a breathing machine after the surgery and will stay in the hospital for several weeks. Once the baby is taken off the breathing machine, they may still need oxygen and some medicine for a while.  Feedings will start after your baby's bowels start working. Feedings are usually given through a small, soft feeding tube from the mouth or nose into the stomach or small intestines until your baby can take all the milk they need by mouth.  Most infants with diaphragmatic hernias have reflux when they eat. This means the food or acid in their stomach moves up into their esophagus, the tube that leads from the throat to the stomach. This can be uncomfortable for your baby. It also leads to frequent spitting up, vomiting, and pneumonia, which makes feedings more difficult once your baby is taking food by mouth.  The nurses and feeding specialists will teach you ways to hold and feed your baby to prevent reflux. Some babies need to be on a feeding tube for a long time to get enough food to grow.

Outlook (Prognosis) : The outcome of this surgery depends on how well your baby's lungs have developed. Some babies have other medical problems, including problems with the brain, muscles, and joints, which may slow recovery.   Usually, the outlook is good for infants who have well-developed lung tissue. Most babies who are born with a diaphragmatic hernia are very ill and will stay in the hospital for a long time. With advances in medicine, the outlook for these infants is gradually improving.  All babies who have had diaphragmatic hernia repairs will need to be watched closely to make sure the hole in their diaphragm does not open up again as they grow.  Babies who had a large opening or defect in the diaphragm, or who had more problems with their lungs after birth, may have lung disease after they leave the hospital. They may need oxygen, medicines, and a feeding tube for months or years.  Some babies will have problems crawling, walking, talking, and eating. They will need to see physical or occupational therapists to help them develop muscles and strength.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001135.htm
Answer: A diaphragmatic hernia is a rare defect. It occurs while the baby is developing in the womb. Because the diaphragm is not fully developed, organs, such as the stomach, small intestine, spleen, part of the liver, and the kidney, may take up part of the chest cavity.  CDH most often involves only one side of the diaphragm. It is more common on the left side. Often, the lung tissue and blood vessels in the area do not develop normally either. It is not clear if the diaphragmatic hernia causes the underdeveloped lung tissue and blood vessels, or the other way around.  40% of babies with this condition have other problems as well. Having a parent or sibling with the condition increases the risk.)

GHR_0000222_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) congenital diaphragmatic hernia ? (Also called: congenital diaphragmatic defect)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia
Answer: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm. The diaphragm, which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest. Abnormal development of the diaphragm before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to its complete absence. An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in an abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth.  In 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or abdominal pain from protrusion of the intestine into the chest cavity. In about 1 percent of cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia has no symptoms; it may be detected incidentally when medical imaging is done for other reasons.  Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. A Bochdalek hernia is a defect in the side or back of the diaphragm. Between 80 and 90 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are of this type. A Morgnani hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm. This type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which accounts for approximately 2 percent of cases, is less likely to cause severe symptoms at birth. Other types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, such as those affecting the central region of the diaphragm, or those in which the diaphragm muscle is absent with only a thin membrane in its place, are rare.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia
Answer: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes.  About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear.  Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations.  More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). Others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement (migration) of cells in the embryo. Environmental factors that influence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identified.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002054.htm
Answer: There are many ways to help an adolescent prepare for a medical test or procedure.  First, provide detailed information and explain the reasons for the procedure. Let your adolescent take part and make as many decisions as possible.  PREPARING BEFORE THE PROCEDURE  Explain the procedure in correct medical terms. Tell your adolescent why the test is being done. (Ask your health care provider to explain it if you are not sure.) Understanding the need for the procedure may reduce your adolescent's anxiety.  To the best of your ability, describe how the test will feel. Allow your adolescent to practice the positions or movements that will be required for the test, such as the fetal position for a lumbar puncture.  Be honest about discomfort your adolescent may feel, but don't dwell on it. It may help to stress the benefits of the test, and to say that the test results may provide more information. Talk about things that your adolescent may enjoy after the test, such as feeling better or going home. Rewards such as shopping trips or movies may be helpful if the adolescent is able to do them.  Tell your adolescent as much as you can about the equipment that will be used for the test. If the procedure will take place in a new location, it may help to tour the facility with your adolescent before the test.  Suggest ways for your adolescent to stay calm, such as:  - Blowing bubbles  - Breathing deeply  - Counting  - Creating a quiet, peaceful environment  - Doing relaxation techniques (thinking pleasant thoughts)  - Holding the hand of a calm parent (or someone else) during the procedure  - Playing hand-held video games  - Using guided imagery  - Trying other distractions, such as listening to music through headphones, if allowed    When possible, let your adolescent make some decisions, such as deciding the time of day or the date of the procedure. The more control a person has over a procedure, the less painful and anxiety-producing it is likely to be.  Allow your adolescent to participate in simple tasks during the procedure, such as holding an instrument, if allowed.  Discuss possible risks. Adolescents are often concerned about risks, particularly about any effects on their appearance, mental function, and sexuality. Address these fears honestly and openly if at all possible. Provide information about any appearance changes or other possible side effects the test may cause.  Older adolescents may benefit from videos that show adolescents of the same age explaining and through the procedure. Ask your health care provider if such films are available for your adolescent to view. It may also be helpful for your adolescent to discuss any concerns with peers who have managed similar stressful situations. Ask your health care provider if they know any teens who are interested in doing peer counseling, or if they can recommend a local support group.  DURING THE PROCEDURE  If the procedure is done at a hospital or your health care provider's office, ask if you can stay with your adolescent. However, if your adolescent does not want you to be there, honor this wish. Out of respect for your adolescent's growing need for privacy and independence, do not allow peers or siblings to watch the procedure unless adolescent asks them to be there.  Do not show your own anxiety. Looking anxious will make your adolescent more upset and worried. Research suggests that children are more cooperative if their parents take measures (such as acupuncture) to reduce their own anxiety.  Other considerations:  - Ask your health care provider to limit the number of strangers entering and leaving the room during the procedure. This can raise anxiety.  - Ask that the provider who has spent the most time with your adolescent be present during the procedure, if possible.  - Your adolescent may have a hard time with a new authority figure entering the situation. This complication can be reduced if someone he or she knows performs the test. Otherwise, your adolescent may show some resistance. Prepare your adolescent in advance for the possibility that the test will be done by someone he or she doesn't know.  - Ask that anesthesia be used, if appropriate, to reduce any discomfort.  - Assure your adolescent that his or her reactions are normal.)

ADAM_0001810_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Handling sharps and needles
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000444.htm
Answer: Summary : Sharps are medical devices like needles, scalpels, and other tools that cut or go into the skin. Learning how to safely handle sharps is important to prevent accidental needlesticks and cuts.

Preventing Injuries : Before you use a sharp object, such as a needle or scalpel, make sure you have all the items you need close by. This includes items like alcohol swabs, gauze, and bandages.  Also, know where the sharps disposal container is. Check to make sure there is enough room in the container for your object to fit. It should not be more than two-thirds full.  Some needles have a protective device, such as a needle shield, sheath, or blunting, that you activate after you remove the needle from the person. This allows you to handle the needle safely, without the risk of exposing yourself to blood or body fluids. If you are using this kind of needle, make sure you know how it works before you use it.  Follow these guidelines when you work with sharps.  - DO NOT uncover or unwrap the sharp object until it is time to use it.  - Keep the object pointed away from yourself and other people at all times.  - Never recap or bend a sharp object.  - Keep your fingers away from the tip of the object.  - If the object is reusable, put it in a secure, closed container after you use it.  - Never hand a sharp object to someone else or put it on a tray for another person to pick up.  - Tell the people you are working with when you plan to set the object down or pick it up.

Sharps Disposal : Make sure the disposal container is made for disposing of sharp objects. Replace containers when they are two-thirds full.  Other important tips include:  - Never put your fingers into the sharps container.  - If the needle has tubing attached to it, hold the needle and the tubing when you put it in the sharps container.  - Sharps containers should be at eye level and within your reach.  - If a needle is sticking out of the container, do not push it in with your hands. Call to have the container removed. Or, a trained person may use tongs to push the needle back into the container.  - If you find an uncovered sharp object outside of a disposal container, it is safe to pick it up only if you can grasp the non-sharp end. If you cannot, use tongs to pick it up and dispose of it.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002055.htm
Answer: Be aware that your child will likely cry, and restraints may be used. The most important way you can help your infant through this procedure is by being there and showing you care.  Crying is a normal response to the strange environment, unfamiliar people, restraints, and separation from you. Your infant will cry more for these reasons than because the test or procedure is uncomfortable.  WHY RESTRAINTS?  Infants lack the physical control, coordination, and ability to follow commands that older children usually have. Restraints may be used during a procedure or other situation to ensure your infant's safety. For example, in order to get clear test results on an x-ray, there cannot be any movement. Your infant may be restrained by hand or with physical devices.  If blood needs to be taken or an IV started, restraints are important in preventing injury to your infant. If your infant moves while the needle is being inserted, the needle could damage a blood vessel, bone, tissue, or nerves.  Your provider will use every means to ensure the safety and comfort of your baby. Beside restraints, other measures include medications, observation, and monitors.  DURING THE PROCEDURE  Your presence helps your infant during the procedure, especially if the procedure allows you to maintain physical contact. If the procedure is performed at the hospital or your health care provider's office, you will likely be able to be present.  If you are not asked to be by your infant's side and would like to be, ask your provider if this is possible. If you think you may become ill or anxious, consider keeping your distance, but staying in your infant's line of vision. If you are not able to be present, leaving a familiar object with your infant may be comforting.  OTHER CONSIDERATIONS  - Ask your provider to limit the number of strangers entering and leaving the room during the procedure, since this can raise anxiety.  - Ask that the provider who has spent the most time with your child perform the procedure.  - Ask that anesthetics be used if appropriate to reduce your child's discomfort.  - Ask that painful procedures not be done in the hospital crib, so that the infant does not come to associate pain with the crib. Many hospitals have special treatment rooms where procedures are done.  - Imitate the behavior you or your health care provider need the infant to do, such as opening the mouth.  - Many children's hospitals have child life specialists who are specially trained to educate patients and families and advocate for them during procedures. Ask if such a person is available.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002057.htm
Answer: Preparing children for medical tests can reduce their distress. It can also make them less likely to cry and resist the procedure. Research shows that lowering anxiety can decrease the sensation of pain people feel during uncomfortable procedures. Even so, being prepared may not change the fact that your child will feel some discomfort or pain.  Before the test, understand that your child will probably cry. Demonstrate in advance what will happen during the test to learn about your child's fears and concerns. Using a doll or other object to act out the test may reveal worries your child may not be able to talk about, and may reduce your child's anxiety.  Most people are frightened of the unknown. It helps if your child knows what to expect. If your child's fears are not realistic, explaining what will actually happen can help. If your child is worried about a part of the test, do not minimize this concern. Reassure your child that you will be there to help as much as you can.  Make sure your child understands that the procedure is not a punishment. Preschool-age children may believe that the pain they feel is a punishment for something they did.  The most important way you can help your child is to prepare properly, and provide support and comfort around the time of the procedure. Ask if the hospital has a child life specialist who can help you before and after the procedure.  PREPARING BEFORE THE PROCEDURE:  Keep your explanations about the procedure to 10 or 15 minutes. Preschoolers have a limited attention span. Explain the test or procedure right before it takes place so that your child doesn't worry about it for days or weeks in advance.  Here are some general guidelines for preparing your child for a test or procedure:  - Explain the procedure in language your child understands, using plain words and avoiding abstract terms.  - Use play preparation to demonstrate the procedure to your child and identify concerns (see the next section).  - Make sure your child understands the body part involved in the test, and that the procedure will be limited to that area.  - Describe as best as you can how the test will feel.  - Be honest with your child about any discomfort or pain the test may cause.  - If the procedure affects a part of the body that your child needs for a certain function (such as speaking, hearing, or urinating), explain what changes will occur afterwards.  - Give your child permission to yell, cry, or express pain in another way using sounds or words.  - Ask if your child has questions about something you have explained.  - Allow your child to practice the positions or movements that will be required for the particular procedure, such as the fetal position for a lumbar puncture.  - Stress the benefits of the procedure and talk about things the child may enjoy after the test, such as feeling better or going home. You may want to take your child for ice cream or some other treat afterwards, but do not make the treat a condition of ""being good"" for the test.  - Practice deep breathing and other comforting activities with your child. If possible, have your child hold your hand and squeeze it when feeling pain.  - Ask the health care provider if your child can make some decisions, when appropriate, such as which arm should have the IV or what color bandage to use.  - Distract your child during and after the procedure with books, songs, counting, deep breathing, or blowing bubbles.    PLAY PREPARATION  Play can be a wonderful way to demonstrate the procedure for your child and identify any anxiety your child may have. Tailor this technique to your child. Most health care facilities for children use play to prepare children for procedures.  Many young children have a favorite toy or other important object that can be a tool for a process called third-party communication. It may be less threatening for your child to express concerns through the toy or object instead of directly. For example, a child who is about to have blood drawn may be better able to understand if you discuss how the ""doll might feel"" during the test.  Toys or dolls can help you explain the procedure to your preschooler. Once you are familiar with the procedure, briefly demonstrate on the toy what your child will experience. Using the toy, show your child:  - Bandages  - How injections are given  - How IVs are inserted  - How surgical cuts are made  - Stethoscopes  - What positions your child will be in    After your demonstration, allow your child to play with some of the items (except for needles and other sharp items). Watch your child for clues about concerns or fears.  No matter what test is performed, your child will probably cry. This is a normal response to a strange environment, unfamiliar people, and separation from you. Knowing this from the beginning may help relieve some of your anxiety about what to expect.  WHY RESTRAINTS?  Your child may be restrained by hand or with physical devices. Young children lack the physical control, coordination, and ability to follow commands that older children and adults usually have. Most tests and procedures require limited or no movement to ensure their accuracy. For example, to get clear results with x-rays there must not be any movement.   Restraints may also be used during a procedure or other situation to ensure your child's safety. Restraints may be used to keep your child safe when staff temporarily have to leave the room during x-ray and nuclear studies. They may also be used when a puncture is done to get a blood sample or start an IV. If your child moves, the needle could cause an injury.  Your child's health care provider will use every method to make sure your child is safe and comfortable. Besides restraints, other measures include medications, monitors, and observation.  Your job as a parent is to comfort your child.  DURING THE PROCEDURE:  Your presence may help your child during the procedure, especially if the procedure allows you to maintain physical contact. If the procedure is performed at the hospital or at your child's health care provider's office, you may be able to be there. If you are not sure, ask if you can be there.  If you think you may become ill or anxious, consider keeping your distance, but stay were your child can see you. If youcannot be present, leave a familiar object with your child for comfort.  Avoid showing your anxiety. This will only make your child feel more upset. Research suggests that children are more cooperative if their parents take measures (such as acupuncture) to reduce their own anxiety. If you are feeling stressed and anxious, consider asking friends and family members for help. They can provide child care for other siblings or meals for the family so you can focus on supporting your child.   Other considerations:  - Ask your child's health care provider to limit the number of strangers entering and leaving the room during the procedure, because this can raise anxiety.  - Ask if the provider who has spent the most time with your child can be present during the procedure.  - Ask if anesthesia can be used, if appropriate, to reduce your child's discomfort.  - Ask that painful procedures not be performed in the hospital bed, so that the child does not link pain with the hospital room.  - If your child can see you during the procedure, do what your child is told to do, such as opening your mouth.  - Ask if a low sensory environment can be created.)

ADAM_0003558_Sec2.txt,"Question: What is (are) Shingles vaccine - what you need to know ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007609.htm
Answer: What is shingles?  Shingles is a painful skin rash, often with blisters. It is also called Herpes Zoster, or just Zoster.  A shingles rash usually appears on one side of the face or body and lasts from 2 to 4 weeks. Its main symptom is pain, which can be quite severe. Other symptoms of shingles can include fever, headache, chills and upset stomach. Very rarely, a shingles infection can lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitits) or death.  For about 1 person in 5, severe pain can continue even long after the rash clears up. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia.  Shingles is caused by the Varicella Zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox.  Only someone who has had chickenpox -- or, rarely, has gotten chickenpox vaccine -- can get shingles. The virus stays in your body, and can cause shingles many years later.  You can't catch shingles from another person with shingles. However, a person who has never had chickenpox (or chickenpox vaccine) could get chickenpox from someone with shingles. This is not very common.  Shingles is far more common in people 50 years of age and older than in younger people. It is also more common in people whose immune systems are weakened because of a disease such as cancer, or drugs such as steroids or chemotherapy.  At least 1 million people a year in the United States get shingles. Shingles vaccine  A vaccine for shingles was licensed in 2006. In clinical trials, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by 50%. It can also reduce pain in people who still get shingles after being vaccinated.  A single dose of shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years of age and older. Some people should not get shingles vaccine or should wait.  A person should not get shingles vaccine who:  - Has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of shingles vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.  - Has a weakened immune system because of current:        - AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system,    - Treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as prolonged use of high-dose steroids,    - Cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy,    - Cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma.      - Is pregnant, or might be pregnant. Women should not become pregnant until at least 4 weeks after getting shingles vaccine.    Someone with a minor acute illness, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But anyone with a moderate or severe acute illness should usually wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. This includes anyone with a temperature of 101.3F or higher. What are the risks from shingles vaccine?  A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. However, the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.  No serious problems have been identified with shingles vaccine.  Mild problems  - Redness, soreness, swelling, or itching at the site of the injection (about 1 person in 3).  - Headache (about 1 person in 70).    Like all vaccines, shingles vaccine is being closely monitored for unusual or severe problems. What if there is a serious reaction?  What should I look for?  - Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.    Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.   What should I do?  - If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.  - Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS website or by calling 1-800-822-7967.    VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. How can I learn more?  - Ask your doctor.  - Contact your local or state health department.  - Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):        - Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO)    - Visit CDC's vaccines website)

ADAM_0003952_Sec2.txt,"Question: What is (are) Toddler test or procedure preparation ? (Also called: Preparing toddler for test/procedure; Test/procedure preparation - toddler; Preparing for a medical test or procedure - toddler)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002056.htm
Answer: Before the test, know that your child will probably cry. Even if you prepare, your child may feel some discomfort or pain. Try using play to show your child what will happen during the test. Doing so may help you learn your child's concerns. The most important way you can help your child is by preparing ahead of time and providing support at the time of the test.  PREPARING BEFORE THE PROCEDURE  Limit your explanations about the procedure to 5 or 10 minutes. Toddlers have a short attention span. Any preparation should take place right before the test or procedure.  Some general guidelines for preparing your child for a test or procedure:  - Explain the procedure in language your child understands, using plain words. Avoid abstract terms.  - Make sure your child understands the exact body part involved in the test, and that the procedure will be limited to that area.  - Try to describe how the test will feel.  - If the procedure affects a part of the body that your child needs for a certain function (such as speaking, hearing, or urinating), explain what changes will occur afterwards.  - Give your child permission to yell, cry, or express pain in another way using sounds or words. Encourage your child to tell you where the pain is located.  - Allow your child to practice the positions or movements that will be needed for the procedure, such as the fetal position for a lumbar puncture.  - Stress the benefits of the procedure. Talk about things that the child may find pleasurable after the test, such as feeling better or going home. You may want to take your child for ice cream or some other treat afterwards, but do not make the treat a condition of ""being good"" for the test.  - Allow your child to make simple choices, such as what color bandage to use after the procedure.  - Distract your child with books, songs, or a simple activity such as blowing bubbles.    PLAY PREPARATION  Play can be a wonderful way to demonstratethe procedure for your child and identify any anxiety your child may have. Tailor this technique to your child. Most health care facilities for children use play to prepare children for procedures.  Many young children have a favorite toy or important object that can be used to explain the test. It may be less threatening for your child to express concerns through the object. For example, a child may be able to understand a blood test if you discuss how the ""doll might feel"" during the test.  Toys or dolls can also help you explain the procedure to your toddler. These visual examples can take the place of unfamiliar words for younger children with a limited vocabulary.  Once you know how the procedure will be done, briefly demonstrate what your child will experience on the toy. Show the body positions the child will be in, where bandages and stethoscopes will be placed, how incisions are made, how injections are given, and how IVs are inserted. After your demonstration, allow your child to play with some of the items (except for needles and other sharp objects). Watch your child for clues about concerns and fears.  No matter which test is performed, your child will probably cry. This is a normal response to a strange environment, unfamiliar people, and separation from you. Knowing this from the beginning may help relieve some of your anxiety about what to expect.  WHY RESTRAINTS?  Your child may be restrained by hand or with physical devices. Young children do not have the physical control, coordination, and ability to follow commands that older children and adults usually have. Most tests and procedures require limited or no movement to ensure their accuracy. For example, to get clear x-ray results, the child cannot move.   Restraints may also be used to make sure your child is safe during a procedure or other situation. For example, restraints may be used to keep your child safe when staff have to temporarily leave the room during x-ray and nuclear studies. Restraints may also be used to hold your child still while the skin is punctured to obtain a blood sample or start an IV. If your child moves, the needle could cause an injury.  Your child's health care provider will to everything possible to make sure your child is safe and comfortable. Besides restraints, other measures include medications, monitors, and observation.  Your job as a parent is to comfort your child.  DURING THE PROCEDURE  Your presence helps your child during the procedure, especially if the procedure allows you to maintain physical contact. If the procedure is performed at a hospital or at your child's health care provider's office, you will most likely be allowed to be there. If you are not sure, ask if you can be there.  If you think you may become ill or anxious, consider keeping your distance, but stay where your child can still see you. If you cannot be there, leave a familiar object with your child for comfort.  Avoid showing your anxiety. This will only make your child more nervous. Research suggests that children are more cooperative if their parents take measures (such as acupuncture) to reduce their own anxiety.   If you are feeling stressed and anxious, consider asking friends and family members for help. They can provide child care for other siblings or meals for the family so you can focus on supporting your child.   Other considerations:  - Your child will probably resist the procedure and may even try to run away. A firm, direct approach from you and the health care staff may be helpful.  - Give one direction at a time during the procedure, using 1- or 2-word commands.  - Avoid covering your child's face.  - Ask your child's health care provider to limit the number of strangers entering and leaving the room during the procedure, because this can raise anxiety.  - Ask if the provider who has spent the most time with your child can be present during the procedure.  - Ask if anesthesia can be used, if appropriate, to reduce your child's discomfort.  - Ask that painful procedures not be performed in the crib, so that your child does not link pain with the crib.  - If your child can see you during the procedure, do what your child is told to do, such as opening your mouth.  - Use your child's normal sense of curiosity as a distraction during the procedure.  - Ask if a low sensory environment can be created.)

NIHSeniorHealth_0000062_Sec15.txt,"Question: How to prevent Shingles ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/shingles/toc.html
Answer: Yes. In May 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a vaccine to prevent shingles in people age 60 and older. The vaccine, called Zostavax, is designed to boost the immune system and protect older adults from getting shingles later on. Even if you have had shingles, you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. There is no maximum age for getting the vaccine, and only a single dose is recommended. The shingles vaccine is NOT recommended if you have active shingles or pain that continues after the rash is gone. (Watch the video to learn more about shingles treatments.

NIHSeniorHealth_0000062_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Shingles ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/shingles/toc.html
Answer: Caused By A Virus Shingles is caused by a virus called varicella-zoster virus -- the one that gave you chickenpox when you were a child. As you recovered from chickenpox, the sores healed and the other symptoms went away, but the virus remained. It is with you for life. The virus hides out in nerve cells, usually in the spine. But it can become active again. Somehow, the virus gets a signal that your immunity has become weakened. This triggers the reactivation. When the virus becomes active again, it follows a nerve path called a dermatome. The nerve path begins at specific points in the spine, continues around one side of the body, and surfaces at the nerve endings in the skin. The pattern of the rash reflects the location of that nerve path. Risk Factors The leading risk factor for shingles is a history of having had chickenpox. One out of every five people who have had chickenpox is likely to get shingles. Another risk factor is aging. As we age, our natural immunity gradually loses its ability to protect against infection. The shingles virus can take advantage of this and become active again. Conditions that weaken the immune system can also put people at risk for shingles. Shingles is especially dangerous for anyone who has had cancer, radiation treatments for cancer, HIV/AIDS, or a transplant operation. Stress is another factor that may contribute to outbreaks. While stress alone does not cause the outbreaks, shingles often occurs in people who have recently had a stressful event in their lives. Most cases of shingles occur in adults. Only about 5 percent of cases occur in children. With children, immune deficiency is the primary risk factor, but children who had chickenpox before they were one year old may also get shingles before they become adults. There have been studies of adults who had chickenpox as children and were later exposed to children who had chickenpox. Interestingly, that exposure apparently boosted the adult's immunity, which actually helped them avoid getting shingles later in life.)

Answer: Shingles is caused by a virus called the varicella-zoster virus -- the one that gave you chickenpox when you were a child. As you recovered from chickenpox, the sores and other symptoms healed, but the virus remained. It is with you for life. Researchers know that the varicella-zoster virus behaves differently from other viruses, such as the flu virus. Our immune system usually kills off invading germs, but it cannot completely knock out this type of virus. The virus just becomes inactive. The virus can become active again, especially in the later years of your life when your immune system doesn't protect you as well from infections. The virus travels from the spinal nerve cells and follows a nerve path out to the skin. Nerve endings in the skin become inflamed and erupt in a very painful rash. Healthcare providers cannot always be sure what the trigger is in each case. They don't know why the virus reactivates in one person with these risk factors, while in another person with the same risk factors, it does not.)

Answer: Shingles (herpes zoster) is an outbreak of rash or blisters on the skin that is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox  the varicella-zoster virus. The first sign of shingles is often burning or tingling pain (which can be severe), or sometimes numbness or itch,generally on one side of the body. After several days or a week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters, similar to chickenpox, appears in one area on one side of the body. Shingles pain can be mild or intense. Some people have mostly itching; some feel pain from the gentlest touch or breeze. The most common location for shingles is a band, called a dermatome, spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline. Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles. Scientists think that some of the virus particles from the original exposure to the varicella-zoster virus,leave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system. When the varicella-zoster virus reactivates, the virus moves back down the long nerve fibers that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin. The viruses multiply, the tell-tale rash erupts, and the person now has shingles.)

Answer: Shingles is a painful rash that develops on one side of the face or body. The rash forms blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days and clear up within 2 to 4 weeks. Most commonly, the rash occurs in a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash occurs on one side of the face. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread and look similar to a chickenpox rash. Shingles is very common. Fifty percent of all Americans will have had shingles by the time they are 80. While shingles occurs in people of all ages, it is most common in 60- to 80-year-olds.

It is distinctive because it affects only one side of the body. The early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages: severe pain or tingling, possibly itchy rash, and blisters that look like chickenpox. The virus that causes shingles is a herpes virus, (Another name for shingles is herpes zoster.) Once you are infected with this kind of virus, it remains in your body for life. It stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. Shingles and Pain The most common complication of shingles is pain -- a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). People with PHN have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash, even after the rash clears up. In most patients, the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months, but some people can have pain from PHN for years. Persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. In fact, one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain. As people get older, they are more likely to develop long-term pain as a complication of shingles and the pain is likely to be more severe. Other Complications Shingles may also lead to other serious complications. - Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected.  -  Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring.  Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected. Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring. - In a very small number of cases, bacteria can cause more serious conditions, including toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection that destroys the soft tissue under the skin.  - The burning waves of pain, loss of sleep, and interference with even basic life activities can cause serious depression.  - In patients with immune deficiency, the rash can be much more extensive than usual and the illness can be complicated by pneumonia. These cases are more serious, but they are rarely fatal.  - Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death.

Shingles Usually Does Not Return People who develop shingles usually have only one episode in their lifetime. However, a person can have a second or even a third episode. The Shingles Vaccine Adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. The vaccine can reduce your risk of shingles and the long-term pain it can cause. If you have already had shingles or you have a chronic medical condition, you can receive the shingles vaccine. (See more about the shingles vaccine in the chapter Prevention.) Is Shingles Contagious? Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister phase.

ADAM_0000357_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ? (Also called: ADD; ADHD; Childhood hyperkinesis)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001551.htm
Answer: ADHD usually begins in childhood, but may continue into the adult years.It is the most commonly diagnosed behavioral disorder in children. ADHD is diagnosed much more often in boys than in girls.  It is not clear what causes ADHD. A combination of genes and environmental factors likely plays a role in the development of the condition. Imaging studies suggest that the brains of children with ADHD are different from those ofchildren without ADHD.)

ADAM_0000445_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Bilirubin blood test (Also called: Total bilirubin - blood; Unconjugated bilirubin - blood; Indirect bilirubin - blood; Conjugated bilirubin - blood; Direct bilirubin - blood)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003479.htm
Answer: Summary : The bilirubin blood test measures the level of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment found in bile, a fluid made by the liver.  Bilirubin can also be measured with a urine test.

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.

How to Prepare for the Test : You should not eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the test. Your health care provider may instruct you to stop taking medicines that affect the test.  Many drugs may change the bilirubin level in your blood. Make sure your provider knows which medicines you are taking.

Why the Test is Performed : A small amount of older red blood cells are replaced by new blood cells every day. Bilirubin is left after these older blood cells are removed. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed from the body in the stool.  A high level of bilirubin in the blood can lead to jaundice. Jaundice is a yellow color in the skin, mucus membranes, or eyes.  Jaundice is the most common reason to check bilirubin level. The test will likely be ordered when:  - The provider is concerned about a newborn's jaundice (most newborns have some jaundice)  - Jaundice develops in older infants, children, and adults   A bilirubin test is also ordered when the provider suspects a person has liver or gallbladder problems.

Normal Results : It is normal to have some bilirubin in the blood. A normal level is:  - Direct (also called conjugated) bilirubin: 0 to 0.3 mg/dL  - Total bilirubin: 0.3 to 1.9 mg/dL   Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : In newborns, bilirubin level is higher for the first few days of life. Your child's provider must consider the following when deciding whether your baby's bilirubin level is too high:  - How fast the level has been rising  - Whether the baby was born early  - The baby's age   Jaundice can also occur when more red blood cells than normal are broken down. This can be caused by:  - A blood disorder called erythroblastosis fetalis  - A red blood cell disorder called hemolytic anemia  - Transfusion reaction in which red blood cells that were given in a transfusion are destroyed by the person's immune system   The following liver problems may also cause jaundice or a high bilirubin level:  - Scarring of the liver (cirrhosis)  - Swollen and inflamed liver (hepatitis)  - Other liver disease  - Disorder in which bilirubin is not processed normally by the liver (Gilbert disease)   The following problems with gallbladder or bile ducts may cause higher bilirubin levels:  - Abnormal narrowing of the common bile duct (biliary stricture)  - Cancer of the pancreas or gallbladder  - Gallstones)

ADAM_0001011_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about CPR - adult and child 9 years and older (Also called: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation - adult; Rescue breathing and chest compressions - adult; Resuscitation - cardiopulmonary - adult; Cardiopulmonary resuscitation - child 9 years and older; Rescue breathing and chest compressions - child 9 years and older; Resuscitation - cardiopulmonary - child 9 years and older)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000013.htm
Answer: Summary : CPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Itis a lifesaving procedure that is done when someone's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This may happen after anelectric shock, drowning, or heart attack. CPR involves:  - Rescue breathing, which provides oxygen to a person's lungs.  - Chest compressions, which keep the person's blood circulating.   Permanent brain damage or death can occur within minutes if a person's blood flow stops. Therefore, you must continue CPR until the person's heartbeat and breathing return, or trained medical help arrives.

Considerations : CPR is best done by someone trained in an accredited CPR course. The procedures described here are NOT a substitute for CPR training. The newest techniques emphasize compression over rescue breathing and airway management, reversing a long-standing practice. See www.americanheart.org for classes near you.  Time is very important when an unconscious person is not breathing. Permanent brain damage begins after only 4 minutes without oxygen, and death can occur as soon as 4 to 6 minutes later.  Machines called automated external defibrillators (AEDs) can be found in many public places, and are available for home use. These machines have pads or paddles to place on the chest during a life-threatening emergency. They automatically check the heart rhythm and give a sudden shock if, and only if, that shock is needed to get the heart back into the right rhythm. When using an AED, follow the instructions exactly.

Causes : In adults, major reasons that heartbeat and breathing stop include:  - Drug overdose   - Excessive bleeding   - Heart problem (heart attack or abnormal heart rhythm, fluid in the lungs or compressing the heart)   - Infection in the bloodstream (sepsis)   - Injuries and accidents  - Drowning  - Stroke There are many things that cause an older child or teen's heartbeat and breathing to stop, including:  - Choking  - Drowning  - Electrical shock  - Excessive bleeding  - Head trauma or serious injury  - Lung disease  - Poisoning  - Suffocation

Symptoms : CPR should be done if a person has any of the following symptoms:  - No breathing or difficulty breathing (gasping)  - No pulse  - Unconsciousness

First Aid : 1. Check for responsiveness. Shake or tap the person gently. See if the person moves or makes a noise. Shout, ""Are you okay?""  2. Call 911 if there is no response. Shout for help and send someone to call 911. If you are alone, call 911 and retrieve an AED (if available), even if you have to leave the person.  3. Carefully place the person on the back.  If there is a chance the person has a spinal injury, two people should move the person to prevent the head and neck from twisting.  4. Perform chest compressions:  - Place the heel of one hand on the breastbone -- right between the nipples.  - Place the heel of your other hand on top of the first hand.  - Position your body directly over your hands.  - Give 30 chest compressions. These compressions should be fast and hard. Press down about 2 inches into the chest. Each time, let the chest rise completely. Count the 30 compressions quickly: ""1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30, off"".   5. Open the airway. Lift up the chin with two fingers. At the same time, tilt the head by pushing down on the forehead with the other hand.  6. Look, listen, and feel for breathing. Place your ear close to the person's mouth and nose. Watch for chest movement. Feel for breath on your cheek.  7. If the person is not breathing or has trouble breathing:  - Cover their mouth tightly with your mouth.  - Pinch the nose closed.  - Keep the chin lifted and head tilted.  - Give two rescue breaths. Each breath should take about a second and make the chest rise.   8. Repeat chest compressions and rescue breathing until the person recovers or help arrives. If an AED for adults is available, use it as soon as possible.  If the person starts breathing again, place him or her in the recovery position. Keep checking for breathing until help arrives.

DO NOT : - If the person has normal breathing, coughing, or movement,do NOT begin chest compressions. Doing so may cause the heart to stop beating.   - Unless you are a health professional,do NOT check for a pulse. Only a health care professional is properly trained to check for a pulse.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : - If you have help, tell one person to call 911 while another person begins CPR.  - If you are alone, as soon as you determine that the person is unresponsive, call 911 immediately. Then begin CPR.

Prevention : In adults, to avoid injuries and heart problems that can lead to the heart stopping beating:  - Eliminate or reduce risk factors that contribute to heart disease, such as cigarette smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, and stress.  - Get plenty of exercise.  - See your health care provider regularly.  - Always use seat belts and drive safely.  - Avoid using illegal drugs. Most children need CPR because of a preventable accident. The following tips may help prevent some accidents in children:  - Teach your children the basic principles of family safety.  - Teach your child to swim.  - Teach your child to watch for cars and ride bikes safely.  - Teach your child firearm safety. If you have guns in your home, keep them locked in an isolated cabinet.)

ADAM_0001158_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001497.htm
Answer: Developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract are problems in a baby girl's reproductive organs that occur while she is growing in her mother's body.  Female reproductive organs include the vagina, ovaries, uterus, and cervix.) 
"
ADAM_0001158_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001497.htm
Answer: A baby starts to develop its reproductive organs between weeks 4 and 5 of pregnancy. This development continues until the 20th week of pregnancy.  The development is a complex process. Many different things can interrupt the process. How severe your baby's problem is depends on when the interruption occurred. In general, the earlier development problems occur in the womb, the more serious the problem.  Problems in the development of a girl's reproductive organs may be caused by:  - Broken or missing genes (genetic defect)  - Use of certain drugs during pregnancy   For example, some babies may have a genetic defect that prevents their body from producing a substance called 21-hydroxylase. If a developing baby girl lacks this substance, she will be born with a uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, but her external genitals will look like those found on boys. See: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia  Certain drugs that the mother takes can pass into the baby's bloodstream and interfere with organ development. One drug known to do this is diethylstilbestrol (DES). Doctors once prescribed this medicine to pregnant women to prevent miscarriage and early labor. However, scientists learned that baby girls born to women who took this drug had an abnormally shaped uterus. The drug also increased the daughters' chances of developing a rare form of vaginal cancer.  Sometimes, a developmental disorder can be seen as soon as the baby is born. It may cause life-threatening conditions in the newborn. Other times, the condition is not diagnosed until the girl is older.  The reproductive tract develops close to the urinary tract and kidneys. It also develops at the same time as several other organs. As a result, developmental problems in the female reproductive tract sometimes occur with problems in other areas, including the urinary tract, kidneys, and lower spine.  Developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract include intersex and ambiguous genitalia. See the specific articles for information on these conditions.  Other developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract include:  - Cloacal abnormalities -- The cloaca is a tube-like structure. In the early stages of a baby's development, the urinary tract, rectum, and vagina all empty into this one tube. But, later in development, the three areas separate and have their own openings. If the cloaca persists as a baby girl grows in the womb, all the openings do not form. For example, a baby may be born with only one opening on the bottom of the body near the rectal area. Urine and feces cannot drain out of the body. This can cause severe pain, stomach swelling, and breathing problems. Some cloacal abnormalities may cause a baby girl to look like she has a male's penis. These birth defects are rare.  - Problems with outer (external) genitals -- Developmental problems may lead to a swollen clitoris or fused labia (when the folds of tissue around the opening of the vagina are joined together). Most other problems of the outer genitals are related to intersex or ambiguous genitalia.  - Imperforate hymen -- The hymen is a thin tissue that partly covers the opening to the vagina. An imperforate hymen completely blocks the vaginal opening. This often leads to painful swelling of the vagina. Sometimes, the hymen has only a very small opening or tiny small holes. This problem may not be discovered until puberty. Some baby girls are born without a hymen.  - Ovarian problems -- A baby girl may have an extra ovary, extra tissue attached to an ovary, or structures called ovotestes that have both male and female tissue.  - Uterus and cervix problems-- A baby girl may be born with an extra cervix and uterus, a half-formed uterus, or a blockage of the uterus. Usually, girls born with half a uterus and half a vagina are missing the kidney on the same side of the body.  - Vaginal problems-- A baby girl may be born without a vagina or have the vaginal opening blocked by a layer of cells that are higher up in the vagina than where the hymen is. A missing vagina is most often due to Mayer-Rokitansky-Kster-Hauser syndrome. In this syndrome, the baby is missing part or all of the internal reproductive organs (uterus, cervix, and fallopian tubes). Other abnormalities include having two vaginas or a vagina that opens into the urinary tract, a heart shaped uterus, and a uterus with a wall in the middle of the cavity)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/congenital-contractural-arachnodactyly
Answer: Congenital contractural arachnodactyly is a disorder that affects many parts of the body. People with this condition typically are tall with long limbs (dolichostenomelia) and long, slender fingers and toes (arachnodactyly). They often have permanently bent joints (contractures) that can restrict movement in their hips, knees, ankles, or elbows. Additional features of congenital contractural arachnodactyly include underdeveloped muscles, a rounded upper back that also curves to the side (kyphoscoliosis), permanently bent fingers and toes (camptodactyly), ears that look ""crumpled,"" and a protruding chest (pectus carinatum). Rarely, people with congenital contractural arachnodactyly have heart defects such as an enlargement of the blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body (aortic root dilatation) or a leak in one of the valves that control blood flow through the heart (mitral valve prolapse). The life expectancy of individuals with congenital contractural arachnodactyly varies depending on the severity of symptoms but is typically not shortened.  A rare, severe form of congenital contractural arachnodactyly involves both heart and digestive system abnormalities in addition to the skeletal features described above; individuals with this severe form of the condition usually do not live past infancy.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/noonan-syndrome
Answer: Noonan syndrome is a condition that affects many areas of the body. It is characterized by mildly unusual facial characteristics, short stature, heart defects, bleeding problems, skeletal malformations, and many other signs and symptoms.  People with Noonan syndrome have distinctive facial features such as a deep groove in the area between the nose and mouth (philtrum), widely spaced eyes that are usually pale blue or blue-green in color, and low-set ears that are rotated backward. Affected individuals may have a high arch in the roof of the mouth (high-arched palate), poor alignment of the teeth, and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). Many children with Noonan syndrome have a short neck and both children and adults may have excess neck skin (also called webbing) and a low hairline at the back of the neck.  Approximately 50 to 70 percent of individuals with Noonan syndrome have short stature. At birth, they are usually of normal length and weight, but growth slows over time. Abnormal levels of growth hormone may contribute to the slow growth.  Individuals with Noonan syndrome often have either a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or a protruding chest (pectus carinatum). Some affected people may also have an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis).  Most people with Noonan syndrome have a heart defect. The most common heart defect is a narrowing of the valve that controls blood flow from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary valve stenosis). Some affected individuals have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening of the heart muscle that forces the heart to work harder to pump blood.  A variety of bleeding disorders have been associated with Noonan syndrome. Some people may have excessive bruising, nosebleeds, or prolonged bleeding following injury or surgery. Women with a bleeding disorder typically have excessive bleeding during menstruation (menorrhagia) or childbirth.  Adolescent males with Noonan syndrome typically experience delayed puberty. Affected individuals go through puberty starting at age 13 or 14 and have a reduced pubertal growth spurt. Most males with Noonan syndrome have undescended testicles (cryptorchidism), which may be related to delayed puberty or to infertility (inability to father a child) later in life. Females with Noonan syndrome typically have normal puberty and fertility.  Noonan syndrome can cause a variety of other signs and symptoms. Most children diagnosed with Noonan syndrome have normal intelligence, but a small percentage has special educational needs, and some have intellectual disability. Some affected individuals have vision or hearing problems. Infants with Noonan syndrome may be born with puffy hands and feet caused by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema), which can go away on its own. Affected infants may also have feeding problems, which typically get better by age 1 or 2. Older individuals can also develop lymphedema, usually in the ankles and lower legs.)

Answer: Is it hard for your child to sit still? Does your child act without thinking first? Does your child start but not finish things? If so, your child may have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Nearly everyone shows some of these behaviors at times, but ADHD lasts more than 6 months and causes problems in school, at home and in social situations.    ADHD is more common in boys than girls. It affects 3-5 percent of all American children.    The main features of ADHD are       - Inattention    - Hyperactivity    - Impulsivity       No one knows exactly what causes ADHD. It sometimes runs in families, so genetics may be a factor. There may also be environmental factors.    A complete evaluation by a trained professional is the only way to know for sure if your child has ADHD. Treatment may include medicine to control symptoms, therapy, or both.

Answer: Summary : Planning for the end of life can be difficult. But by deciding what end-of-life care best suits your needs when you are healthy, you can help those close to you make the right choices when the time comes.    End-of-life planning usually includes making choices about the following:       - The goals of care (for example, whether to use certain medicines during the last days of life)    - Where you want to spend your final days    - Which treatments for end-of-life care you wish to receive    - What type of palliative care and hospice care you wish to receive       Advance directives can help make your wishes clear to your family and health care providers.)

NINDS_0000006_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder ?
URL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/adhd/adhd.htm
Answer: Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioral disorder that affects 3-5 percent of all American children. It interferes with a person's ability to stay on a task and to exercise age-appropriate inhibition (cognitive alone or both cognitive and behavioral). Some of the warning signs of ADHD include failure to listen to instructions, inability to organize oneself and school work, fidgeting with hands and feet, talking too much, leaving projects, chores and homework unfinished, and having trouble paying attention to and responding to details. There are several types of ADHD: a predominantly inattentive subtype, a predominantly hyperactive-impulsive subtype, and a combined subtype. ADHD is usually diagnosed in childhood, although the condition can continue into the adult years.) 
"
NINDS_0000006_Sec2.txt,"Question: What are the treatments for Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder ?
URL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/adhd/adhd.htm
Answer: The usual course of treatment may include medications such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) or dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), which are stimulants that decrease impulsivity and hyperactivity and increase attention. Most experts agree that treatment for ADHD should address multiple aspects of the individual's functioning and should not be limited to the use of medications alone. Treatment should include structured classroom management, parent education (to address discipline and limit-setting), and tutoring and/or behavioral therapy for the child.)

Answer: The exact prevalence of antiphospholipid syndrome is unknown. This condition is thought to be fairly common, and may be responsible for up to one percent of all thromboses.

GHR_0000063_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) antiphospholipid syndrome ? (Also called: anti-phospholipid syndrome; antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; Hughes syndrome)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/antiphospholipid-syndrome
Answer: Antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder characterized by an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots (thromboses) that can block blood vessels. This clotting tendency is known as thrombophilia. In antiphospholipid syndrome, the thromboses can develop in nearly any blood vessel in the body, but most frequently occur in the vessels of the lower limbs. If a blood clot forms in the vessels in the brain, blood flow is impaired and can lead to stroke. Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs.  Women with antiphospholipid syndrome are at increased risk of complications during pregnancy. These complications include pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (preeclampsia), an underdeveloped placenta (placental insufficiency), early delivery, or pregnancy loss (miscarriage). In addition, women with antiphospholipid syndrome are at greater risk of having a thrombosis during pregnancy than at other times during their lives. At birth, infants of mothers with antiphospholipid syndrome may be small and underweight.  A thrombosis or pregnancy complication is typically the first sign of antiphospholipid syndrome. This condition usually appears in early to mid-adulthood but can begin at any age.  Other signs and symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome that affect blood cells and vessels include a reduced amount of blood clotting cells called platelets (thrombocytopenia), a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) due to their premature breakdown (hemolysis), and a purplish skin discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood vessels of the skin. In addition, affected individuals may have open sores (ulcers) on the skin, migraine headaches, heart disease, or intellectual disability. Many people with antiphospholipid syndrome also have other autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus.  Rarely, people with antiphospholipid syndrome develop thromboses in multiple blood vessels throughout their body. These thromboses block blood flow in affected organs, which impairs their function and ultimately causes organ failure. These individuals are said to have catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). CAPS typically affects the kidneys, lungs, brain, heart, and liver, and is fatal in over half of affected individuals. Less than 1 percent of individuals with antiphospholipid syndrome develop CAPS.)

GHR_0000063_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to antiphospholipid syndrome ? (Also called: anti-phospholipid syndrome; antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; Hughes syndrome)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/antiphospholipid-syndrome
Answer: The genetic cause of antiphospholipid syndrome is unknown. This condition is associated with the presence of three abnormal immune proteins (antibodies) in the blood: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-B2 glycoprotein I. Antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but the antibodies in antiphospholipid syndrome attack normal human proteins. When these antibodies attach (bind) to proteins, the proteins change shape and bind to other molecules and receptors on the surface of cells. Binding to cells, particularly immune cells, turns on (activates) the blood clotting pathway and other immune responses.  The production of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-B2 glycoprotein I may coincide with exposure to foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, that are similar to normal human proteins. Exposure to these foreign invaders may cause the body to produce antibodies to fight the infection, but because the invaders are so similar to the body's own proteins, the antibodies also attack the human proteins. Similar triggers may occur during pregnancy when a woman's physiology, particularly her immune system, adapts to accommodate the developing fetus. These changes during pregnancy may explain the high rate of affected females.  Certain genetic variations (polymorphisms) in a few genes have been found in people with antiphospholipid syndrome and may predispose individuals to produce the specific antibodies known to contribute to the formation of thromboses. However, the contribution of these genetic changes to the development of the condition is unclear.  People who test positive for all three antibodies but have not had a thrombosis or recurrent miscarriages are said to be antiphospholipid carriers. These individuals are at greater risk of developing a thrombosis than is the general population.)

Answer: Most cases of antiphospholipid syndrome are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Rarely, the condition has been reported to run in families; however, it does not have a clear pattern of inheritance. Multiple genetic and environmental factors likely play a part in determining the risk of developing antiphospholipid syndrome.)

NHLBI_0000005_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/aps
Answer: Antiphospholipid (AN-te-fos-fo-LIP-id) antibody syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur if the body's immune system makes antibodies that attack and damage tissues or cells.
                
Antibodies are a type of protein. They usually help defend the body against infections. In APS, however, the body makes antibodies that mistakenly attack phospholipidsa type of fat.
                
Phospholipids are found in all living cells and cell membranes, including blood cells and the lining of blood vessels.
                
When antibodies attack phospholipids, cells are damaged. This damage causes blood clots to form in the body's arteries and veins. (These are the vessels that carry blood to your heart and body.)
                
Usually, blood clotting is a normal bodily process. Blood clots help seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls. This prevents you from losing too much blood. In APS, however, too much blood clotting can block blood flow and damage the body's organs.
                
Overview
                
Some people have APS antibodies, but don't ever have signs or symptoms of the disorder. Having APS antibodies doesn't mean that you have APS. To be diagnosed with APS, you must have APS antibodies and a history of health problems related to the disorder.
                
APS can lead to many health problems, such as stroke, heart attack, kidney damage, deep vein thrombosis (throm-BO-sis), and pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm).
                
APS also can cause pregnancy-related problems, such as multiple miscarriages, a miscarriage late in pregnancy, or a premature birth due to eclampsia (ek-LAMP-se-ah). (Eclampsia, which follows preeclampsia, is a serious condition that causes seizures in pregnant women.)
                
Very rarely, some people who have APS develop many blood clots within weeks or months. This condition is called catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS).
                
People who have APS also are at higher risk for thrombocytopenia (THROM-bo-si-to-PE-ne-ah). This is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets). Antibodies destroy the platelets, or theyre used up during the clotting process. Mild to serious bleeding can occur with thrombocytopenia.
                
APS can be fatal. Death may occur as a result of large blood clots or blood clots in the heart, lungs, or brain.
                
Outlook
                
APS can affect people of any age. However, it's more common in women and people who have other autoimmune or rheumatic (ru-MAT-ik) disorders, such as lupus. (""Rheumatic"" refers to disorders that affect the joints, bones, or muscles.)
                
APS has no cure, but medicines can help prevent its complications. Medicines are used to stop blood clots from forming. They also are used to keep existing clots from getting larger. Treatment for APS is long term.
                
If you have APS and another autoimmune disorder, it's important to control that condition as well. When the other condition is controlled, APS may cause fewer problems.)

NINDS_0000024_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Antiphospholipid Syndrome ?
URL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/antiphosphlipid/antiphospholipid.htm
Answer: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder caused when antibodies -- immune system cells that fight off bacteria and viruses -- mistakenly attack healthy body tissues and organs. In APS, specific antibodies activate the inner lining of blood vessels, which leads to the formation of blood clots in arteries or veins. APS is sometimes called sticky blood syndrome, because of the increased tendency to form blood clots in the veins and arteries. The symptoms of APS are due to the abnormal blood clotting. Clots can develop in the veins of the legs and lungs, or in the placenta of pregnant women. One of the most serious complications of APS occurs when a clot forms in the brain and causes a stroke. Other neurological symptoms include chronic headaches, dementia (similar to the dementia of Alzheimers disease), and seizures. Infrequently, individuals will develop chorea (a movement disorder in which the body and limbs writhe uncontrollably), cognitive dysfunction (such as poor memory), transverse myelitis, depression or psychosis, optic neuropathy, or sudden hearing loss. In pregnant women, clots in the placenta can cause miscarriages. APS is diagnosed by the presence of a positive antiphospholipid antibody and either a history of blood clots in an artery or vein or a history of multiple miscarriages or other pregnancy problems. Some individuals will have a characteristic lacy, net-like red rash called livedo reticularis over their wrists and knees.)

NINDS_0000024_Sec2.txt,"Question: What are the treatments for Antiphospholipid Syndrome ?

Answer: The main goal of treatment is to thin the blood to reduce clotting. At present, the recommended treatment is low-dose aspirin. For individuals who have already had a stroke or experience recurrent clots, doctors recommend treatment with the anticoagulant warfarin. Pregnant women are treated with either aspirin or another anticoagulant -- heparin -- since warfarin can cause birth defects.)

NINDS_0000024_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Antiphospholipid Syndrome ?
URL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/antiphosphlipid/antiphospholipid.htm
Answer: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder caused when antibodies -- immune system cells that fight off bacteria and viruses -- mistakenly attack healthy body tissues and organs. In APS, specific antibodies activate the inner lining of blood vessels, which leads to the formation of blood clots in arteries or veins. APS is sometimes called sticky blood syndrome, because of the increased tendency to form blood clots in the veins and arteries. The symptoms of APS are due to the abnormal blood clotting. Clots can develop in the veins of the legs and lungs, or in the placenta of pregnant women. One of the most serious complications of APS occurs when a clot forms in the brain and causes a stroke. Other neurological symptoms include chronic headaches, dementia (similar to the dementia of Alzheimers disease), and seizures. Infrequently, individuals will develop chorea (a movement disorder in which the body and limbs writhe uncontrollably), cognitive dysfunction (such as poor memory), transverse myelitis, depression or psychosis, optic neuropathy, or sudden hearing loss. In pregnant women, clots in the placenta can cause miscarriages. APS is diagnosed by the presence of a positive antiphospholipid antibody and either a history of blood clots in an artery or vein or a history of multiple miscarriages or other pregnancy problems. Some individuals will have a characteristic lacy, net-like red rash called livedo reticularis over their wrists and knees.)

NINDS_0000024_Sec2.txt,"Question: What are the treatments for Antiphospholipid Syndrome ?
URL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/antiphosphlipid/antiphospholipid.htm
Answer: The main goal of treatment is to thin the blood to reduce clotting. At present, the recommended treatment is low-dose aspirin. For individuals who have already had a stroke or experience recurrent clots, doctors recommend treatment with the anticoagulant warfarin. Pregnant women are treated with either aspirin or another anticoagulant -- heparin -- since warfarin can cause birth defects.)

NINDS_0000024_Sec4.txt,"Question: what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Antiphospholipid Syndrome ?
URL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/antiphosphlipid/antiphospholipid.htm
Answer: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support research on APS through grants to major medical institutions across the country.NINDS-funded research is looking at ways to reduce clotting and prevent stroke. Among other NIH-funded research efforts, scientists are examining the role of antiphospholipid antibodies in clotting and pregnancy loss, which is commonly seen in individuals with lupus. Another project hopes to identify potential inherited risk factors for the development of APS.)

Answer: A good way to find out if someone is confused is to ask the person his or her name, age, and the date. If they are unsure or answer incorrectly, they are confused.  If the person does not usually have confusion, call a doctor.  A confused person should not be left alone. For safety, the person may need physical restraints.  To help a confused person:  - Always introduce yourself, no matter how well the person once knew you.  - Often remind the person of his or her location.  - Place a calendar and clock near the person.  - Talk about current events and plans for the day.  - Try to keep the surroundings calm, quiet, and peaceful.   For sudden confusion due to low blood sugar (for example, from diabetes medication), the person should drink a sweet drink or eat a sweet snack. If the confusion lasts longer than 10 minutes, call the doctor.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003158.htm
Answer: Glands in the cervix and the walls of the vagina normally produce a clear mucus. This is very common among women of childbearing age.   - These secretions may turn white or yellow when exposed to the air.  - The amount of mucus produced varies during the menstrual cycle as hormone levels in the body change.    The following factors can increase the amount of normal vaginal discharge:  - Feeling stressed  - Ovulation (the production and release of an egg from your ovary in the middle of your menstrual cycle)  - Pregnancy  - Sexual excitement    Different types of infections may cause itching or a discharge in the vagina. These include:  - Infections spread during sexual contact. These include chlamydia, gonorrhea (GC), and trichomoniasis.  - Vaginal yeast infection, caused by a fungus.  - Normal bacteria that live in the vagina that overgrow, causing a gray discharge and fishy odor. This is called bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is not often spread through sexual contact.    Other causes of vaginal discharge and itching may be:  - Menopause and low estrogen levels, which may lead to vaginal dryness and other symptoms (Atrophic vaginitis).  - Forgotten tampon or foreign body, which may cause a foul odor.  - Chemicals found in detergents, fabric softeners, feminine sprays, ointments, creams, douches, and contraceptive foams or jellies orcreams, which may irritate the vagina or the skin around the vagina   Less common causes include:  - Cancer of the cervix or vagina   - Skin conditions, such as desquamative vaginitis and lichen planus)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003158.htm
Answer: Keep your genital area clean and dry when you have vaginitis.   - Avoid soap and just rinse with water to clean yourself.   - Soak in a warm, not hot, bath may help your symptoms. Dry thoroughly afterward.   Avoid douching. Many women feel cleaner when they douche, but it may actually worsen symptoms because it removes healthy bacteria that line the vagina. These bacteria help protect against infection.   Other tips are:   - Avoid using hygiene sprays, fragrances, or powders in the genital area.   - Use pads and not tampons while you have an infection.   - If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar levels in good control.   Allow more air to reach your genital area. You can do this by:   - Wearing loose-fitting clothes and not wearing panty hose   - Wearing cotton underwear (rather than synthetic), or underwear that has a cotton lining in the crotch. Cotton increases air flow and decreases moisture buildup.   - Not wearing underwear at night when you sleep.   Girls and women should also:   - Know how to properly clean their genital area while bathing or showering.   - Wipe properly after using the toilet -- always from front to back.   - Wash thoroughly before and after using the bathroom.   Always practice safe sex, and use condoms to avoid catching or spreading infections.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003159.htm
Answer: To prevent and treat vaginal irritation, your child should:  - Avoid colored or perfumed toilet tissue and bubble bath.  - Use plain, unscented soap.   - Limit bath time to 15 minutes or less. Ask your child to urinate right after the bath  - Use only plain warm water. Do not add baking soda, Aveeno oatmeal, or anything else to the bathwater.   - Do not let soap float in the bathwater. If you need to shampoo, do so at the end of the bath.   Teach your child to keep the genital area clean and dry. She should:  - Pat the outer vagina and vulva dry rather than rubbing it with tissue. Doing so will help prevent small balls of tissue from breaking off.  - Move toilet tissue from front to back (vagina to anus) after urinating or having a bowel movement.   Your child should:  - Wear cotton panties. Avoid underwear made from synthetic or manmade materials.  - Have your child change underwear every day.   - Avoid tight pants or shorts.  - Change out of wet clothing, especially wet bathing suits or exercise clothing, as soon as possible   Do not try to remove any foreign object from a child's vagina. You may push the object back farther or injure your child by mistake. Take the child to a health care provider right away for removal.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682134.html
Answer: Methadone comes as a tablet, a dispersible (can be dissolved in liquid) tablet , a solution (liquid), and a concentrated solution to take by mouth. When methadone is used to relieve pain, it may be taken every 8 to 12 hours. If you take methadone as part of a treatment program, your doctor will prescribe the dosing schedule that is best for you. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take methadone exactly as directed.  If you are using the dispersible tablets, do not chew or swallow before mixing the tablet in a liquid. If your doctor has told you to take only part of a tablet, break the tablet carefully along the lines that have been scored into it. Place the tablet or piece of the tablet in at least 120 mL (4 ounces) of water, orange juice, Tang, citrus flavors of Kool-Aid, or a citrus fruit drink to dissolve. Drink the entire mixture right away. If some tablet residue remains in the cup after you drink the mixture, add a small amount of liquid to the cup and drink it all.  Your doctor may change your dose of methadone during your treatment. Your doctor may decrease your dose or tell you to take methadone less often as your treatment continues. If you experience pain during your treatment, your doctor may increase your dose or may prescribe an additional medication to control your pain. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment with methadone. Do not take extra doses of methadone or take doses of methadone earlier than they are scheduled even if you experience pain.  Do not stop taking methadone without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably want to decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking methadone, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, teary eyes, runny nose, yawning, sweating, chills, muscle pain, widened pupils (black circles in the middle of the eyes), irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, stomach cramps, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, or diarrhea.)

ADAM_0001591_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Fine motor control
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002364.htm
Answer: Summary : Fine motor control is the coordination of muscles, bones, and nerves to produce small, exact movements. An example of fine motor control is picking up a small item with the index finger (pointer finger or forefinger) and thumb.  The opposite of fine motor control is gross (large, general) motor control. An example of gross motor control is waving an arm in greeting.  Problems of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves (nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord), muscles, or joints may all decrease fine motor control. People with Parkinson disease have trouble speaking, eating, and writing because they have lost fine motor control.  The amount of fine motor control in children is used to figure out the child's developmental age. Children develop fine motor skills over time, by practicing and being taught. To have fine motor control, children need:  - Awareness and planning  - Coordination  - Muscle strength  - Normal sensation    The following tasks can only occur if the nervous system develops in the right way:  - Cutting out shapes with scissors  - Drawing lines or circles  - Folding clothes  - Holding and writing with a pencil  - Stacking blocks  - Zipping a zipper)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003899.htm
Answer: Summary : Fine needle aspiration of the thyroid gland is a procedure to remove thyroid cells for examination. The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland located inside the front of the lower neck.

How the Test is Performed : This test may be done in the health care provider's office or in a hospital. Numbing medicine (anesthesia) may or may not be used because the needle is very thin.  You lie on your back with a pillow under your shoulders and your neck extended. The biopsy site is cleaned. A thin needle is inserted into the thyroid, and a sample of thyroid cells and fluid are removed. The needle is then taken out.  Pressureis applied to the biopsy site to stop any bleeding. The siteis thencovered with a bandage.

How to Prepare for the Test : Tell your health care provider if you have drug allergies, bleeding problems, or are pregnant. You should also make sure your health care provider has a current list of all medicines you take, including herbal remedies and over-the-counter drugs.  A few days to a week before surgery, you may be asked to stop takingmedicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. Talk with your doctor before stopping any drugs. The drugs you may need to stop taking include:  - Aspirin  - Clopidogrel (Plavix)  - Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)  - Naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn)  - Warfarin (Coumadin)

How the Test will Feel : If numbing medicine is used, you may feel a sting as the needle is inserted and the medicine is injected.  As the needle passes into the thyroid, you may feel some pressure, but it should not be painful.  You may have slight discomfort in your neck afterward. You may also haveslight bruising, whichsoon goes away.

Why the Test is Performed : This is a test to diagnose thyroid disease or thyroid cancer. It is often used tofind out ifthyroidnodules that are felt by the doctor or seen by ultrasound are noncancerous or cancerous.

Normal Results : The thyroid tissue looks normal and the cells do notappearto be cancerunder a microscope.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may mean:  - Diffuse thyroid disease such as goiter or thyroiditis  - Noncancerous tumors  - Thyroid cancer

Risks : The main risk is bleeding into or around the thyroid gland. If bleeding is severe, there maybe pressure on thewindpipe (trachea). Thisproblem is rare.)

Answer: Many physical and emotional factors can cause infertility. It may be due to problems in the woman, man, or both.  FEMALE INFERTILITY  Female infertility may occur when:  - A fertilized egg or embryo does not survive once it attaches to the lining of the womb (uterus).  - The fertilized egg does not attach to the lining of the uterus.  - The eggs cannot move from the ovaries to the womb.  - The ovaries have problems producing eggs.    Female infertility may be caused by:   - Autoimmune disorders, such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)  - Birth defects that affect the reproductive tract  - Cancer or tumor  - Clotting disorders  - Diabetes  - Drinking too much alcohol  - Exercising too much  - Eating disorders or poor nutrition  - Growths (such as fibroids or polyps) in the uterus and cervix  - Medicines such as chemotherapy drugs  - Hormone imbalances  - Obesity  - Older age  - Ovarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)  - Pelvic infection or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)  - Scarring from sexually transmitted infection, abdominal surgery or endometriosis  - Smoking  - Surgery to prevent pregnancy (tubal ligation) or failure of tubal ligation reversal (reanastomosis)  - Thyroid disease    MALE INFERTILITY  Male infertility may be due to:  - Decreased number of sperm  - Blockage that prevents the sperm from being released  - Defects in the sperm    Male infertility can be caused by:  - Birth defects  - Cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation  - Exposure to high heat for prolonged periods  - Heavy use of alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine  - Hormone imbalance  - Impotence  - Infection  - Medicines such as cimetidine, spironolactone, and nitrofurantoin  - Obesity  - Older age  - Retrograde ejaculation  - Scarring from sexually transmitted infections, injury, or surgery  - Smoking  - Toxins in the environment  - Vasectomy or failure of vasectomy reversal    Healthy couples under age 30 who have sex regularly will have a 25 to 30% per month chance of getting pregnant each month.  A woman is most fertile in her early 20s. The chance a woman can get pregnant drops greatly after age 35 (and especially after age 40). The age when fertility starts to decline varies from woman to woman.  Infertility problems and miscarriage rates increase significantly after 35 year of age. There are now options for early egg retrieval and storage for women in their 20's. This will help ensure a successful pregnancy if childbearing is delayed until after age 35. This is an expensive option, but for women who know they will need to delay childbearing, it may be worth considering.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001191.htm
Answer: Deciding when to get treated for infertility depends on your age. Health care providers often suggest that women under 30 try to get pregnant on their own for 1 year before getting tested.  Many experts recommend that women over 35 attempt conception for only 6 months. If a pregnancy does not occur within that time, they should talk to their provider.   Infertility testing involves a medical history and physical exam for both partners.  Blood and imaging tests are most often needed. In women, these may include:  - Blood tests to check hormone levels, including progesterone and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)  - Home urine ovulation detection kits  - Measurement of body temperature every morning to see if the ovaries are releasing eggs  - FSH and clomid challenge test  - Antimullerian hormone testing (AMH)  - Hysterosalpingography (HSG)  - Pelvic ultrasound  - Laparoscopy  - Thyroid function tests    Tests in men may include:  - Sperm testing  - Exam of the testes and penis  - Ultrasound of the male genitals (sometimes done)  - Blood tests to check hormone levels  - Testicular biopsy (rarely done))

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001191.htm
Answer: Treatment depends on the cause of infertility. It may involve:  - Education and counseling about the condition  - Fertility treatments such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) and in vitro fertilization (IVF)  - Medicines to treat infections and clotting disorders  - Medicines that help the growth and release of eggs from the ovaries   Couples can increase the chances of becoming pregnant each month by having sex at least every 3 days before and during ovulation.   Ovulation occurs about 2 weeks before the next menstrual cycle (period) starts. Therefore, if a woman gets her period every 28 days the couple should have sex at least every 3 days between the 10th and 18th day after her period starts.  Having sex before ovulation occurs is especially helpful.   - Sperm can live inside a woman's body for at least 3 days.   - However, a woman's egg can only be fertilized by the sperm for a few hours after it is released.    Women who are under or overweight, may increase their chances of becoming pregnant by getting to a healthier weight.)

ADAM_0002476_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Lymph node biopsy (Also called: Biopsy - lymph nodes; Open lymph node biopsy; Fine needle aspiration biopsy; Sentinel lymph node biopsy)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003933.htm
Answer: Summary : A lymph node biopsy is the removal of lymph node tissue for examination under a microscope.  The lymph nodes are small glands that make white blood cells (lymphocytes), which fight infection. Lymph nodes may trap the germs that are causing an infection. Canceroften spreads to lymph nodes.

How the Test is Performed : A lymph node biopsy is done in an operating room in a hospital. Or, it is done at an outpatient surgical center. The biopsy may be done in different ways.  An open biopsy is surgery to remove all or part of the lymph node:   - You lie on the examination table. You may be given medicine to calm you and make you sleepy.  - The biopsy site is cleansed.  - The health care provider injects a local anesthetic (numbing medication) into the area. Sometimes, general anesthesia is used, which means you are asleep and pain-free.  - A small surgical cut (incision)is made. The lymph node or part of the node is removed.   - Theincision is closed with stitches and a bandage is applied.  - An open biopsy may take 30to 45 minutes.   For some cancers, a special way of finding the best lymph node to biopsy is used. This is called sentinal lymph node biopsy, and it involves:  - A tiny amount of a tracer, either a radioactive tracer (radioisotope) or a blue dye, is injected at the tumor site.  - The tracer or dye flows into the nearest (local) node. This node is called the sentinel node.It is the first lymph node to whicha cancer spreads.  - The sentinel node and possibly one or two other lymph nodes are removed.   The sample is then sent to the laboratory for examination.  A needle biopsy involves inserting a needle into a lymph node. This type of biopsy is done less often because the results are not as helpful as with an open biopsy.

How to Prepare for the Test : Tell your health care provider:  - If you are pregnant  - If you have any drug allergies  - If you have bleeding problems  - What medications you are taking (including any supplements or herbal remedies)   Your doctor may ask you to:  - Stop taking any blood thinners, such as aspirin, heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), or clopidogrel (Plavix) 5to 10 days before the procedure  - Not eat or drink anything after a certain period of time before the biopsy  - Arrive at a certain time for the procedure   You must sign a consent form.

How the Test will Feel : When the local anesthetic is injected, you will feel a prick and a mild stinging. The biopsy site will be sore for a few days after the test.  After an open biopsy, the pain is mild and you can easily control it with an over-the-counter pain medication. You may also notice some bruising or fluid leaking for a few days. Theincision should heal in 10to 14 days. Follow instructions for taking care of the incision.While the incision is healing, avoid any type of intense exercise or heavy lifting.

Why the Test is Performed : The test is used to diagnose cancer, sarcoidosis,or an infection (such as tuberculosis):  - When you or your doctor feel swollen glands and they do not go away  - When lymph nodes are present on a CT or MRI scan  - For some patients with breast cancer or melanoma, to see if the cancer has spread (sentinel lymph node biopsy)    The results of the biopsy help your doctor decide on further tests and treatments.

Normal Results : If a lymph node biopsy does not show any signs of cancer, it is more likely that other lymph nodes nearby are also cancer-free. This information can help the health care provider decide about further tests and treatments.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may be due to many different conditions, from very mild infections to cancer.  For example, enlarged lymph nodes may be due to:  - Cancers (breast, lung, oral)  - HIV  - Hodgkin lymphoma  - Infection (tuberculosis, cat scratch disease)  - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma  - Sarcoidosis

Risks : - Bleeding  - Infection (in rare cases, the wound may get infected and you may need to take antibiotics)  - Nerve injury if the biopsy is done on a lymph node close to nerves (the numbness usually goes away in a few months))

Answer: Your doctor has ordered methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, to relieve inflammation (swelling, heat, redness, and pain). The drug will be added to an intravenous fluid that will drip through a needle or catheter placed in your vein for at least 1 hour per day.  Methylprednisolone is similar to a natural hormone produced by your adrenal glands. It is used to treat, but not cure, certain forms of arthritis; skin, blood, kidney, eye, thyroid, and intestinal disorders (e.g., colitis); and multiple sclerosis. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.  Your healthcare provider (doctor, nurse, or pharmacist) may measure the effectiveness and side effects of your treatment using laboratory tests and physical examinations. It is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. The length of treatment depends on how you respond to the medication.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682795.html
Answer: Methylprednisolone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. Your doctor will prescribe a dosing schedule that is best for you. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take methylprednisolone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Do not stop taking methylprednisolone without talking to your doctor. Stopping the drug abruptly can cause loss of appetite, upset stomach, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, headache, fever, joint and muscle pain, peeling skin, and weight loss. If you take large doses for a long time, your doctor probably will decrease your dose gradually to allow your body to adjust before stopping the drug completely. Watch for these side effects if you are gradually decreasing your dose and after you stop taking the tablets. If these problems occur, call your doctor immediately. You may need to increase your dose of tablets temporarily or start taking them again.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682795.html
Answer: Before taking methylprednisolone,  - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to methylprednisolone, aspirin, tartrazine (a yellow dye in some processed foods and drugs), or any other drugs.  - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin), arthritis medications, aspirin, azithromycin (Zithromax), clarithromycin (Biaxin), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), digoxin (Lanoxin), diuretics ('water pills'), erythromycin, estrogen (Premarin), ketoconazole (Nizoral), oral contraceptives, phenobarbital, phenytoin (Dilantin), rifampin (Rifadin), theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamins.  - if you have a fungal infection (other than on your skin), do not take methylprednisolone without talking to your doctor.  - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver, kidney, intestinal, or heart disease; diabetes; an underactive thyroid gland; high blood pressure; mental illness; myasthenia gravis; osteoporosis; herpes eye infection; seizures; tuberculosis (TB); or ulcers.  - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking methylprednisolone, call your doctor.  - if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking methylprednisolone.  - if you have a history of ulcers or take large doses of aspirin or other arthritis medication, limit your consumption of alcoholic beverages while taking this drug. Methylprednisolone makes your stomach and intestines more susceptible to the irritating effects of alcohol, aspirin, and certain arthritis medications. This effect increases your risk of ulcers.)

Answer: Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your response to methylprednisolone. Checkups are especially important for children because methylprednisolone can slow bone growth.  If your condition worsens, call your doctor. Your dose may need to be adjusted.  Carry an identification card that indicates that you may need to take supplementary doses (write down the full dose you took before gradually decreasing it) of methylprednisolone during periods of stress (injuries, infections, and severe asthma attacks). Ask your pharmacist or doctor how to obtain this card. List your name, medical problems, drugs and dosages, and doctor's name and telephone number on the card.  This drug makes you more susceptible to illnesses. If you are exposed to chicken pox, measles, or tuberculosis (TB) while taking methylprednisolone, call your doctor. Do not have a vaccination, other immunization, or any skin test while you are taking methylprednisolone unless your doctor tells you that you may.  Report any injuries or signs of infection (fever, sore throat, pain during urination, and muscle aches) that occur during treatment.  Your doctor may instruct you to weigh yourself every day. Report any unusual weight gain.  If your sputum (the matter you cough up during an asthma attack) thickens or changes color from clear white to yellow, green, or gray, call your doctor; these changes may be signs of an infection.  If you have diabetes, methylprednisolone may increase your blood sugar level. If you monitor your blood sugar (glucose) at home, test your blood or urine more frequently than usual. Call your doctor if your blood sugar is high or if sugar is present in your urine; your dose of diabetes medication and your diet may need to be changed.  Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription.  It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003119.htm
Answer: Morning sickness is very common. Most pregnant women have at least some nausea, and about a third have vomiting.  Morning sickness usually begins during the first month of pregnancy and continues through the 14th to 16th week (3rd or 4th month). Some women have nausea and vomiting through their entire pregnancy.  Morning sickness does not hurt the baby in any way unless you lose weight, such as with severe vomiting. Mild weight loss during the first trimester is not uncommon when women have moderate symptoms, and is not harmful to the baby.  The amount of morning sickness during one pregnancy does not predict how you will feel in future pregnancies.)

Answer: Try to keep a positive attitude. Remember that morning sickness usually stops after the first 3 or 4 months of pregnancy. To reduce nausea, try:  - A few soda crackers or dry toast when you first wake up, even before you get out of bed in the morning.  - A small snack at bedtime and when getting up to go to the bathroom at night.  - Avoid large meals; instead, snack as often as every 1 - 2 hours during the day and drink plenty of fluids.  - Eat foods high in protein and complex carbohydrates, such as peanut butter on apple slices or celery; nuts; cheese; crackers; milk; cottage cheese; and yogurt; avoid foods high in fat and salt, but low in nutrition.  - Ginger products (proven effective against morning sickness) such as ginger tea, ginger candy, and ginger soda.    Here are some more tips:  - Acupressure wrist bands or acupuncture may help. You can find these bands in drug, health food, and travel and boating stores. If you are thinking about trying acupuncture, talk to your doctor and look for an acupuncturist who is trained to work with pregnant women.  - Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke.  - Avoid taking medications for morning sickness. If you do, ask a doctor first.  - Keep air flowing through rooms to reduce odors.  - When you feel nauseated, bland foods like gelatin, broth, ginger ale, and saltine crackers can soothe your stomach.  - Take your prenatal vitamins at night. Increase vitamin B6 in your diet by eating whole grains, nuts, seeds, and peas and beans (legumes). Talk to your doctor about possibly taking vitamin B6 supplements.)

ADAM_0002668_Sec2.txt,"Question: What is (are) Morning sickness ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000604.htm
Answer: Morning sickness often begins 4 to 6 weeks after conception and may continue until the 4th month of pregnancy. Some women have morning sickness during their entire pregnancy. This happens most often for women who are carrying more than 1 baby.  It is called morning sickness because the symptoms are more likely to occur early in the day, but they can occur at any time. For some women, morning sickness lasts all day.  The exact cause of morning sickness is not known.  - Most experts think changes in the woman's hormone levels during pregnancy cause it.  - Other factors that can make the nausea worse include a pregnant woman's enhanced sense of smell and gastric reflux.    Morning sickness that is not severe does not hurt your baby in any way. In fact:  - It may even be a sign that all is well with you and your baby.  - Morning sickness may be associated with a lower risk of miscarriage.  - Your symptoms probably show that the placenta is making all the right hormones for your growing baby.   When nausea and vomiting are severe, a condition known as hyperemesis gravidarum may be diagnosed.)

Answer: Vitamin B6 (100 mg or less daily) has been shown to ease symptoms of morning sickness. Many health care providers recommend trying it first before trying other medicines.  There are no drugs currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat morning sickness. Your provider may not advise medicines to prevent nausea unless your vomiting is severe and will not stop.  - The drug doxylamine (brand name Unisom) may be taken along with vitamin B6 to treat nausea and vomiting.

ADAM_0003077_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Physical activity (Also called: Fitness recommendations; Exercise)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001941.htm
Answer: Summary : Physical activity -- which includes an active lifestyle and routine exercise -- plus eating well, is the best way to stay healthy.

Information : An effective exercise program needs to be fun and keep you motivated. It helps to have a goal.  Your goal might be to:  - Manage a health condition  - Reduce stress  - Improve your stamina  - Buy clothes in a smaller size    Your exercise program can also be a good way for you to socialize. Taking exercise classes or exercising with a friend are both good ways to be social.  You may have a hard time starting an exercise routine, but once you do start, you may begin to notice other benefits, such as:  - Better control of your weight and appetite  - Improved fitness, making it easier to do everyday activities  - Improved sleep  - More confidence in yourself  - Lower risk for heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure    GETTING STARTED  You do not need to join a gym to exercise. If you have not exercised or been active in a long time, start slowly to prevent injuries. Taking a brisk 10-minute walk twice a week is a good start.  Try joining a dance, yoga, or karate class if it appeals to you. You could also join a baseball or bowling team, or even a mall-walking group. The social aspects of these groups can be rewarding and motivating.  The most important thing is to do exercises that you can maintain and enjoy.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Talk with your health care provider before starting an exercise program if:  - You have diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, or another long-term illness  - You are obese  - You have not been very active lately  - You get chest pains or shortness of breath when you are active    Build physical activity into your regular routine  Simple lifestyle changes can make a big difference over time.  - At work, try taking the stairs instead of the elevator, walking down the hall to talk with a co-worker instead of sending an email, or adding a 10- to 20-minute walk during lunch.  - When you are running errands, try parking at the far end of the parking lot or down the street. Even better, walk to the store or other nearby places.  - At home, do chores such as vacuuming, washing the car, gardening, raking leaves, or shoveling snow.  - If you ride the bus or other public transportation, get off 1 stop before your usual stop and walk the rest of the way.    REDUCE YOUR SCREEN TIME  Sedentary behaviors are things you do while you are sitting still. Decreasing your sedentary behaviors can help you lose weight. For most people, the best way to decrease sedentary behaviors is to reduce the time they spend watching TV and using a computer and other electronic devices. All of these activities are called ""screen time.""  Some ways to decrease screen time are:  - Choose 1 or 2 TV programs to watch, and turn off the TV when they are over.  - Do not keep the TV on all the time for background noise -- you might end up sitting down and watching it. Turn on the radio instead. You can be up doing things around the house and still listen tothe radio.  - Do not eat while you watch TV.  - Take the batteries out of your TV remote control and get up to change the channel.  - Before you turn on the TV, take your dog or a neighbor's dog for a walk. If you are going to miss your favorite show, record it.  - Find activities to replace TV watching. Read a book, play a board game with family or friends, or take an evening cooking class.  - Work out on an exercise or yoga ball while you watch TV. You will burn calories. Or, set up a stationary bike or treadmill in front of your TV and use it while you watch.    If you like playing video games, try games that require you to move your whole body, not just your thumbs.   HOW MUCH EXERCISE DO YOU NEED?  Aim to exercise about 2.5 hours a week. It's important to do both moderate-intensity aerobic activity that increases your heart rate and muscle strengthening. Muscle strengthening, also called strength training, resistance training, or endurance exercise, should be done 2 times a week. Depending on your schedule, you could exercise for 30 minutes 5 days a week, or 45 to 60 minutes 3 days a week.  You do not have to do your total daily exercise all at once. If your goal is to exercise for 30 minutes, you can break that up into shorter time periods that add up to 30 minutes.  As you become more fit, you can challenge yourself by increasing the intensity of your exercise by going from light to moderate activity. You can also increase the amount of time you exercise.)

ADAM_0003841_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Taking medicines to treat tuberculosis ? (Also called: Tuberculosis - medicines; DOT; Directly observed therapy; TB - medicines)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000425.htm
Answer: Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious bacterial infection that involves the lungs, but may spread to other organs.  You may have a TB infection but no active disease or symptoms. This means the TB bacteria remain inactive (dormant) in a small area of your lungs. This type of infection may be present for years and is called latent TB. With latent TB:   - You cannot spread TB to other people.  - In some people, the bacteria can become active. If this happens, you may become sick or you can pass the TB germs to someone else.  - Even though you do not feel sick, you need to take medicines for TB for 6 to 9 months. This is the only way to make sure all of the TB bacteria in your body are killed.    When you have active TB, you may feel sick or have a cough, lose weight, feel tired, or have a fever or night sweats. In this case:  - You can pass TB to people around you. This includes people you live, work, or come in close contact with.  - You need to take medicines for TB for at least 6 months to rid your body of the TB bacteria. You should begin to feel better within a month of starting medicines.  - For the first 2 to 4 weeks after starting the medicines, you may need to stay home to avoid spreading TB to others. Ask your doctor when it is OK to be around others.  - Your doctor is required by law to report your case to the local public health department.    Ask your doctor whether others with whom you work or live should be tested for TB.)

MPlusHealthTopics_0000804_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Self-harm ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/selfharm.html
Answer: Self-harm refers to a person's harming their own body on purpose. About 1 in 100 people hurts himself or herself in this way. More females hurt themselves than males. A person who self-harms usually does not mean to kill himself or herself. But they are at higher risk of attempting suicide if they do not get help.    Self-harm tends to begin in teen or early adult years. Some people may engage in self-harm a few times and then stop. Others engage in it more often and have trouble stopping.    Examples of self-harm include       - Cutting yourself (such as using a razor blade, knife, or other sharp object to cut the skin)    - Punching yourself or punching things (like a wall)    - Burning yourself with cigarettes, matches, or candles    - Pulling out your hair    - Poking objects through body openings    - Breaking your bones or bruising yourself       Many people cut themselves because it gives them a sense of relief. Some people use cutting as a means to cope with a problem. Some teens say that when they hurt themselves, they are trying to stop feeling lonely, angry, or hopeless.    It is possible to overcome the urge to hurt yourself. There are other ways to find relief and cope with your emotions. Counseling may help.

MPlusDrugs_0001116_Sec1.txt,"Question: Who should get Simvastatin and why is it prescribed ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a692030.html
Answer: Simvastatin is used together with diet, weight-loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Simvastatin is also used to decrease the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (''bad cholesterol'') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (''good cholesterol'') in the blood. Simvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Simvastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.  Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with simvastatin has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000827.htm
Answer: The pain from cancer can have a few different causes:  - The cancer. When a tumor grows it can press on nerves, bones, organs, or the spinal cord, causing pain.  - Medical tests. Some medical tests, such as a biopsy or bone marrow test, can cause pain.  - Treatment. Many types of cancer treatments can cause pain, including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.    Everyone's pain is different. Your pain can range from mild to severe and may last for only a short time or continue for a long time.)

Answer: To make sure you get the right treatment for your pain, it is important to be as honest as possible with your provider. You will want to tell your provider:  - What your pain feels like (aching, dull, throbbing, constant, or sharp)  - Where you feel the pain  - How long the pain lasts  - How strong it is  - If there is a time of day it feels better or worse  - If there is anything else that makes it feel better or worse  - If your pain keeps you from doing any activities    Your provider may ask you to rate your pain using a scale or a chart. It may be helpful to keep a pain diary to help track your pain. You can also keep track of when you take medicine for your pain and how much it helps. This will help your provider know how well the medicine is working.)

Answer: There are three main types of medicines for cancer pain. Your provider will work with you to find a medicine that works best for you with the least amount of side effects. In general, you will start with the least amount of medicine with the fewest side effects that relieves your pain. If one medicine does not work, your provider may suggest another. It may take a little time to find the right medicine and the right dose that is right for you.  - Non-opioid pain relievers. These medicines include acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others), and naproxen (Aleve). They are best to treat mild to moderate pain. You can buy most of these medicines over the counter.  - Opioids or narcotics. These are stronger medicines that are used to treat moderate to severe pain. You need to have a prescription to take them. Some common opioids include codeine, fentanyl, morphine, and oxycodone. You may take these medicines in addition to other pain relievers.  - Other types of medicines. Your provider may prescribe other medicines to help with your pain. These can include anticonvulsants or antidepressants for nerve pain or steroids to treat pain from swelling.)

ADAM_0000808_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Choking - adult or child over 1 year (Also called: Abdominal thrusts - adult or child over 1 year; Heimlich maneuver - adult or child over 1 year: Choking - back blows - adult or child over 1 year)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000049.htm
Answer: Summary : Choking is when someone is having a very hard time breathing because food, a toy, or other object is blocking the throat or windpipe (airway).  A choking person's airway may be blocked so that not enough oxygen reaches the lungs. Without oxygen, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 to 6 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save a person's life.

Causes : Choking can be caused by any of the following:  - Eating too fast, not chewing food well, or eating with dentures that donotfit well  - Drinking alcohol (even a small amount of alcohol affects awareness)  - Being unconscious and breathing in vomit  - Breathing in small objects (young children)  - Injury to the head and face (for example, swelling, bleeding, or a deformity can cause choking)  - Swallowing problems after a stroke  - Enlarging tonsils or tumors of the neck and throat  - Problems with the esophagus (food pipe or swallowing tube)

Symptoms : When an older child or adult is choking, they willoften grab their throat with the hand. If the person does notdo this, look for these danger signs:  - Inability to speak  - Difficulty breathing  - Noisy breathing or high-pitched sounds while inhaling  - Weak, ineffective coughing   - Bluish skin color  - Loss of consciousness if blockage is not cleared

First Aid : First ask, ""Are you choking? Can you speak?"" DO NOT perform first aid if the person is coughing forcefully and is able to speak. A strong cough can dislodge the object. Encourage the person to keep coughing to dislodge the object.  If the person cannot speak or is having a hard time breathing, you need to act fast to help the person. You can perform abdominal thrusts, back blows, or both.  To perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver):  - Stand behind the person and wrap your arms around the person's waist. For a child, you may have to kneel.  - Make a fist with one hand. Place the thumb side of your fist just above the person's navel, well below the breastbone.  - Grasp the fist tightly with your other hand.  - Make a quick, upward and inward thrust with your fist.  - Check if the object is dislodged.  - Continue these thrusts until the object is dislodged or the person loses consciousness (see below).   To perform back blows:  - Stand behind the person. For child, you may have to kneel.  - Wrap one arm around to support the person's upper body. Lean the person forward until the chest is about parallel to the ground.  - Use the heel of your other hand to deliver a firm blow between the persons shoulder blades.  - Check if the object is dislodged.  - Continue back blows until the object is dislodged or the person loses consciousness (see below).   To perform abdominal thrusts AND back blows (5-and-5 approach):  - Give 5 back blows, as described above.  - If the object is not dislodged, give 5 abdominal thrusts.  - Keep performing the 5-and-5 until the object is dislodged or the person loses consciousness (see below).   IF THE PERSON FAINTS OR LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS  - Lower the person to the floor.  - Call 911 or the local emergency number or tell someone else to do so.  - Begin CPR. Chest compressions may help dislodge the object.  - If you see something blocking the airway and it isloose, try to remove it. If the object is lodged in the person's throat, do NOT try to grasp it. This can push the object farther into the airway.   FOR PREGNANT OR OBESE PEOPLE  - Wrap your arms around the person's CHEST.  - Place your fist on the MIDDLE of the breastbone between the nipples.  - Make firm, backward thrusts.   After removing the object that caused the choking, keep the person still and get medical help. Anyone who is choking should have a medical examination. Complications can occur not only from the choking, but also from the first aid measures that were taken.

DO NOT : - DO NOT interfere if the person is coughing forcefully, is able to speak, or is able to breathe in and out adequately. But, be ready to act right away if the person's symptoms get worse.  - DO NOT force open the person's mouth to try to grasp and pull out the object if the person is conscious. Perform abdominal thrusts and/or back blows to try to expel the object.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Seek medical help right away if you find someone unconscious.  When the person is choking:  - Tell someone to call 911 or the local emergency number while you begin first aid/CPR.  - If you are alone, shout for help and begin first aid/CPR.   After the object is successfully dislodged, the person should see a doctor because complications can arise.  In the days following a choking episode, contact a doctor right away if the person develops:  - A cough that does not go away  - Pneumonia and fever  - Shortness of breath  - Wheezing   These could be signs that the object entered the lung instead of being expelled.

Prevention : To prevent choking:  - Eat slowly and chew food thoroughly.  - Make sure dentures fit properly.  - Do not drink too much alcohol before or during eating.  - Keep small objects away from young children.)

Answer: Primary symptoms of cocaine withdrawal may include:  - Agitation and restless behavior  - Depressed mood  - Fatigue  - General feeling of discomfort   - Increased appetite  - Vivid and unpleasant dreams  - Slowing of activity   The craving and depression can last for months after stopping long-term heavy use (particularly daily use). Withdrawal symptoms may also be associated with suicidal thoughts in some people.  During withdrawal, there can be powerful, intense cravings for cocaine. However, the ""high"" associated with ongoing use becomes less and less pleasant. It can produce fear and extreme suspicion rather than joy (euphoria). Even so, the cravings may remain powerful.)

ADAM_0001284_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Drug allergies ? (Also called: Allergic reaction - drug (medication); Drug hypersensitivity; Medication hypersensitivity)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000819.htm
Answer: Adverse reactions to drugs are common. (adverse means unwanted or unexpected.) Almost any drug can cause an adverse reaction. Reactions range from irritating or mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting to life-threatening anaphylaxis.  A true drug allergy is caused by a series of chemical steps in the body that produce the allergic reaction to a medication.  The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. However, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) called IgE against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the IgE tells your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine, which causes your allergy symptoms. A drug allergy may also occur without your body producing IgE. Instead, it might produce other types of antibodies, or have other reactions that do not produce antibodies.  Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medication or vaccine.  Common allergy-causing drugs include:  -  Anticonvulsants   -  Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin)   -  Iodinated (containing iodine) x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions)   -  Penicillin and related antibiotics   -  Sulfa drugs    Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause nonallergic hives or trigger asthma. Some drug reactions are considered idiosyncratic. This means the reaction is an unusual effect of the medication. It is not due to a known chemical effect of the drug. Many people confuse an uncomfortable, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a true drug allergy.)

Answer: Call your health care provider if you are taking a medication and seem to be having a reaction to it.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000819.htm
Answer: There is generally no way to prevent a drug allergy.  If you have a known drug allergy, avoiding the medication is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction. You may also be told to avoid similar medicines.  In some cases, a health care provider may approve the use of a drug that causes an allergy if you are first treated with corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine). Do not try this without a health care provider's supervision. Pretreatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines has been shown to prevent anaphylaxis in people who need to get x-ray contrast dye.

ADAM_0002555_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Medication safety during your hospital stay (Also called: Five-rights - medication; Medication administration - hospital; Medical errors - medication)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000501.htm
Answer: Summary : Medication safety means you get the right medicine, the right dose, at the right times. During your hospital stay, your health care team needs to follow many steps to make sure this happens. You can also help ensure that you get the right medicines the right way.

Getting the right medicine : All hospitals have a process in place to make sure you get the right medicines. A mistake could cause a problem for you. The process is as follows:  - Your doctor writes an order in your medical record for your medicine. This prescription goes to the hospital pharmacy.  - The hospital pharmacist reads and fills the prescription. The medicine is labeled with the type of medicine and your name, and then sent to your nurse.  - Your nurse reads the prescription label and gives you the medicine. This is called administering the medicine.  - Your nurse and the rest of your health care team monitor (watch) you to see how you respond to the medicine. They watch to make sure the medicine is working. They also look for side effects the medicine could cause.

Filling your prescriptions : The pharmacy may receive some prescriptions by computer (electronic) and some that are handwritten. Electronic prescriptions are easier to read than handwritten prescriptions, meaning there is less chance of a medicine error with electronic prescriptions.  Your doctor can tell your nurse to write down a prescription for you. Then your nurse can send the prescription to the pharmacy. This is called a verbal order. Your nurse should repeat the prescription back to your doctor to make sure it is right before sending it to the pharmacy.  Your doctor, nurse, and pharmacist will check to make sure any new medicines you receive do not cause a bad reaction with other medicines you are already taking.

The 5 rights of medicine : The 5 rights of medicine is a checklist nurses use to make sure you get the right medicine. The 5 rights are as follows:  - Right medicine (Is the right medicine being given?)  - Right dose (Is the amount and strength of the medicine correct?)  - Right patient (Is the medicine being given to the right patient?)  - Right time (Is it the right time to give the medicine?)  - Right route (Is the medicine being given the right way? It may be given by mouth, through a vein, on your skin, or another way.)

Tips to stay safe : You can help make sure you get the right medicine the right way during your hospital stay by doing the following:  - Tell your nurse and other health care providers about any allergies or side effects you have had to any medicines in the past.  - Make sure your nurse and doctor know all the medicines, supplements, and herbs you were taking before you came to the hospital. Bring a list of all these with you. It is a good idea to keep this list in your wallet and with you at all times.  - While you are in the hospital, do not take medicines you brought from home unless your doctor tells you it is OK. Make sure to tell your nurse if you take your own medicine.  - Ask what each medicine is for. Also ask what side effects to watch for and tell your nurse about.  - Know the names of the medicines you get and what times you should get them in the hospital.  - Ask your nurse to tell you what medicines they are giving you. Keep a list of what medicines you get and what times you got them. Speak up if you think you are getting the wrong medicine or getting a medicine at the wrong time.  - Any container that has medicine in it should have a label with the name of the medicine on it. This includes all syringes, tubes, bags, and pill bottles. If you do not see a label, ask your nurse what the medicine is.  - Ask your nurse if you are taking any high-alert medicine. These are medicines that can cause harm if they are not given the right way, even if they are used for the right purpose. High-alert medicines include blood thinners, insulin, and narcotic pain medicines. Ask what extra safety steps are being taken if you are taking a high-alert medicine.)

Answer: In 2014 in the US, about 435,000 people used heroin. In the same year, about 4.3 million people were nonmedical users of narcotic pain relievers. This means they were taking narcotics that were not prescribed to them. Narcotic pain relievers include:  - Codeine  - Heroin  - Hydrocodone (Vicodin)  - Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)  - Methadone  - Meperidine (Demerol)  - Morphine  - Oxycodone (Percocet or Oxycontin)   These drugs can cause physical dependence. This means that a person relies on the drug to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Over time, more of the drug is needed for the same effect. This is called drug tolerance.  How long it takes to become physically dependent varies with each person.  When the person stops taking the drugs, the body needs time to recover. This causes withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal from opiates can occur any time long-term use is stopped or cut back.)

Answer: Withdrawal from these drugs on your own can be very hard and may be dangerous. Treatment most often involves medicines, counseling, and support. You and your health care provider will discuss your care and treatment goals.  Withdrawal can take place in a number of settings:  - At-home, using medicines and a strong support system. (This method is difficult, and withdrawal should be done very slowly.)  - Using facilities set up to help people with detoxification (detox).  - In a regular hospital, if symptoms are severe.   MEDICINES  Methadone relieves withdrawal symptoms and helps with detox. It is also used as a long-term maintenance medicine for opioid dependence. After a period of maintenance, the dose may be decreased slowly over a long time. This helps reduce the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Some people stay on methadone for years.  Buprenorphine (Subutex) treats withdrawal from opiates, and it can shorten the length of detox. It may also be used for long-term maintenance, like methadone. Buprenorphine may be combined with Naloxone (Bunavail, Suboxone, Zubsolv), which helps prevent dependence and misuse.  Clonidine is used to help reduce anxiety, agitation, muscle aches, sweating, runny nose, and cramping. It does not help reduce cravings.  Other medicines can:  - Treat vomiting and diarrhea  - Help with sleep   Naltrexone can help prevent relapse. It is available in pill form or as an injection.  People who go through withdrawal over and over should be treated with long-term methadone or buprenorphine maintenance.  Most people need long-term treatment after detox. This can include:  - Self-help groups, like Narcotics Anonymous or SMART Recovery  - Outpatient counseling  - Intensive outpatient treatment (day hospitalization)  - Inpatient treatment   Anyone going though detox for opiates should be checked for depression and other mental illnesses. Treating these disorders can reduce the risk of relapse. Antidepressant medicines should be given as needed.)

Answer: Complications include vomiting and breathing in stomach contents into the lungs. This is called aspiration, and it can cause lung infection. Vomiting and diarrhea can cause dehydration and body chemical and mineral (electrolyte) disturbances.  The biggest complication is returning to drug use. Most opiate overdose deaths occur in people who have just detoxed. Withdrawal reduces the person's tolerance to the drug, so those who have just gone through withdrawal can overdose on a much smaller dose than they used to take.)

What takes away your pain might not work for someone else.  Taking pain medicines before exercising is OK. But do not overdo the exercise just because you have taken the medicine.  Read labels to learn how much medicine you can give your child at one time and during thewhole day. This is known as the dosage. Talk to your pharmacist or your childs health care provider if you are not sure about the correct amount. Do not give children medicine that is meant for adults.  Other tips for taking pain medicines:  - If you take pain relievers on most days, tell your health care provider. You may need to be watched for side effects.  - Do not take more than the amount recommended on thecontainer or more than your provider tells you to take.  - Read the warnings on the label before taking the medicine.  - Store medicine safely and securely. Check the dates on medicinecontainers to see when you should throwthem away.    Acetaminophen  Acetaminophen is known as a non-aspirin pain reliever. It is NOT an NSAID, which is described below.  - Acetaminophen relieves fever and headaches, and other common aches and pains. It does not relieve inflammation.  - This medicine does not cause as many stomach problems as other pain medicines do. It is also safer for children. Acetaminophen is often recommended for arthritis pain because it has fewer side effects than other pain medicines.  - Examples of OTC brands of acetaminophen are Tylenol, Paracetamol, and Panadol.  - Acetaminophen prescribed by a doctor is usually a stronger medicine. It is often combined with a narcotic ingredient.    Precautions  - Adults should not take more than 3 grams (3,000 mg) of acetaminophen in a single day. Large amounts can harm your liver. Remember that 3 grams is about the same as six extra-strength pills or nine regular pills.  - If you are also taking pain medicine prescribed by your health care provider, talk to your provider or pharmacist before taking any OTC acetaminophen.  - For children, follow package instructions for the maximum amount your child can have in a single day. Call your health care provider if you are not sure about the instructions.    NSAIDs  - NSAIDs relieve fever and pain. They also reduce swelling from arthritis or a muscle sprain or strain.  - When taken for a short time (no longer than 10 days), NSAIDs are safe for most people.  - Some NSAIDs can be bought over the counter, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn).  - Other NSAIDs are prescribed by your health care provider.    Precautions  - DO NOT give aspirin to children. Reye syndrome can occur when aspirin is used to treat children who have viral infections, such as chickenpox or the flu.    Talk to your health care provider or pharmacist before using any over-the-counter NSAID if you:  - Have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or stomach or digestive tract bleeding.  - Take other medicines, especially blood thinners such as warfarin or clopidgrel.  - Are taking NSAIDs prescribed by your health care provider, including celecoxib (Celebrex) or nabumetone (Relafen).)

ADAM_0002917_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Pain medications - narcotics ? (Also called: Painkillers; Drugs for pain; Analgesics; Opioids)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007489.htm
Answer: Narcotics are also called opioid pain relievers. They are used only for pain that is severe and is not helped by other types of painkillers. When used carefully and under a health care provider's direct care, these drugs can be effective at reducing pain.  Narcotics work by binding to receptors in the brain, which blocks the feeling of pain.  You should not use a narcotic drug for more than 3 to 4 months, unless you are under direct care of your provider.  NAMES OF NARCOTICS  - Codeine  - Fentanyl -- available as a patch  - Hydrocodone  - Hydromorphone  - Meperidine  - Morphine  - Oxycodone  - Tramadol   TAKING NARCOTICS  These drugs can be abused and habit-forming. They have been associated with accidental overdose deaths. Always take narcotics as prescribed. Your provider may suggest that you take your medicine only when you feel pain.  Or, your doctor may suggest taking a narcotic on a regular schedule. Allowing the medicine to wear off before taking more of it can make the pain difficult to control.   Taking narcotics to control the pain of cancer or other medical problems does not itself lead to dependence.  Store narcotics safely and securely in your home.  You may need a pain specialist to help you manage long-term pain.  SIDE EFFECTS OF NARCOTICS  Drowsiness and impaired judgment often occur with these medicines. When taking a narcotic, do not drink alcohol, drive, or operate heavy machinery.  You can relieve itching by reducing the dose or talking to your doctor about switching medicines.  To help with constipation, drink more fluids, get more exercise, eat foods with extra fiber, and use stool softeners.  If nausea or vomiting occur, try taking the narcotic with food.  Withdrawal symptoms are common when you stop taking a narcotic. Symptoms include strong desire for the medicine (craving), yawning, insomnia, restlessness, mood swings, or diarrhea. To prevent withdrawal symptoms, your doctor may recommend you gradually lower the dosage over time.)

ADAM_0003709_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Stay active and exercise - arthritis ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000377.htm
Answer: When you have arthritis, being active is good for your overall health and sense of well-being.  Exercise keeps your muscles strong and increases your range of motion. (This is how much you can bend and flex your joints). Tired, weak muscles add to the pain and stiffness of arthritis.  Stronger muscles also help you with balance to prevent falls. Being stronger can also give you more energy, and help you lose weight and sleep better.  If you will be having surgery, exercising can help you stay strong, which will speed up your recovery.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000849.htm
Answer: Today's cancer treatments help cure many children of cancer. These treatments also may cause health problems later on. These are called ""late effects.""  Late effects are treatment side effects that appear several months or years after treatment for cancer. Late effects can impact one or more areas of the body. Effects can be mild to severe. Examples include learning, vision, joint, or teeth problems.  Whether your child will have late effects depends on the type of cancer and the treatments your child has. Being aware of your child's risk of long-term health problems can help you follow-up with health care providers and detect any problems early.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000849.htm
Answer: Some cancer treatments damage healthy cells. The damage is not seen during treatment, but as the child's body grows, changes in cell growth or function appear.   The medicines used for chemotherapy and the high-energy rays used in radiation therapy can harm healthy cells. This damage can change or delay the way cells grow. Radiation therapy has a more direct effect on long-term growth than chemotherapy.  When cancer surgery is performed, it may cause changes in the growth or function of an organ.  Your child's health care team will come up with a treatment plan to avoid harming healthy cells as much as possible.)

Answer: There are many types of late effects depending on where the cancer was and what types of treatments were done. Many of the effects can be managed. The following are examples of some late effects based on body parts affected.  Brain:  - Learning  - Memory  - Attention  - Language  - Behavior problems  - Seizures, headaches    Ears:  - Hearing loss  - Ringing in the ears  - Dizziness    Eyes:  - Vision problems  - Dry eyes  - Watery eyes  - Light sensitivity  - Irritation (feels like something is in the eye)  - Drooping eyelid  - Eyelid tumors    Lungs:  - Lungs cannot hold as much air  - Shortness of breath  - Cough  - Trouble breathing  - Increased risk of lung infections  - Increased risk for lung cancer    Mouth:  - Small or missing teeth  - Risk of cavities  - Sensitive teeth  - Delayed tooth development  - Gum disease  - Increased saliva or dry mouth    Other late effects may include:  - Muscle or bone can be affected in any area of the body where treatments were needed. It may impact how a child walks or runs or cause bone or muscle pain, weakness, or stiffness.  - Glands and organs that make hormones may be exposed to treatments. These include the thyroid gland in the neck and pituitary gland in the brain. This can have an effect on later growth, metabolism, puberty, fertility, and other functions.  - The heart's rhythm or function may be affected by certain treatments.  - A small increase in risk of getting another cancer later in life.    Most of the effects above are physical. There may be long-term emotional effects as well. Coping with health problems, extra medical visits, or the worries that come with cancer can be a lifelong challenge.)

MPlusDrugs_0001016_Sec2.txt,"Question: How should Prednisone be used and what is the dosage ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601102.html
Answer: Prednisone comes as a tablet, a solution (liquid), and a concentrated solution to take by mouth. Prednisone is usually taken with food one to four times a day or once every other day. Your doctor will probably tell you to take your dose(s) of prednisone at certain time(s) of day every day. Your personal dosing schedule will depend on your condition and on how you respond to treatment. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take prednisone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often or for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.  If you are taking the concentrated solution, use the specially marked dropper that comes with the medication to measure your dose. You may mix the concentrated solution with juice, other flavored liquids, or soft foods such as applesauce.  Your doctor may change your dose of prednisone often during your treatment to be sure that you are always taking the lowest dose that works for you. Your doctor may also need to change your dose if you experience unusual stress on your body such as surgery, illness, infection, or a severe asthma attack. Tell your doctor if your symptoms improve or get worse or if you get sick or have any changes in your health during your treatment.  If you are taking prednisone to treat a long-lasting disease, the medication may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take prednisone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking prednisone without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking prednisone, your body may not have enough natural steroids to function normally. This may cause symptoms such as extreme tiredness, weakness, slowed movements, upset stomach, weight loss, changes in skin color, sores in the mouth, and craving for salt. Call your doctor if you experience these or other unusual symptoms while you are taking decreasing doses of prednisone or after you stop taking the medication.)

Answer: When someone is drowning:  - Do NOT place yourself in danger.   - Do NOT get into the water or go out onto ice unless you are absolutely sure it is safe.  - Extend a long pole or branch to the person or use a throw rope attached to a buoyant object, such as a life ring or life jacket. Toss it to the person, then pull him or her to shore.  - If you are trained in rescuing people, do so immediately only if you are absolutely sure it will not cause you harm.  - Keep in mind that people who have fallen through ice may not be able to grasp objects within their reach or hold on while being pulled to safety.   If the person's breathing has stopped, begin rescue breathing as soon as you can. This often means starting the breathing process while still in the water.  Continue to breathe for the person every few seconds while moving him or her to dry land. Once on land, give CPRas needed.  Always use caution when moving a person who is drowning. Assume that the person may have a neck or spine injury, and avoid turning or bending their neck. Keep the head and neck very still during CPR and while moving the person. You can tape the head to a backboard or stretcher, or secure the neck by placing rolled towels or other objects around it.  Follow these additional steps:  - Give first aid for any other serious injuries.  - Keep the person calm and still. Seek medical help right away.  - Remove any cold, wet clothes from the person and cover with something warm, if possible. This will help prevent hypothermia.  - The person may cough and have difficulty breathing once breathing restarts. Reassure the person until you get medical help.)

Answer: 1. If you can do so safely, turn off the electrical current. Unplug the cord, remove the fuse from the fuse box, or turn off the circuit breakers. Simply turning off an appliance may NOT stop the flow of electricity. Do NOT attempt to rescue a person near active high-voltage lines.  2. Call your local emergency number, such as 911.   3. If the current can't be turned off, use a non-conducting object, such as a broom, chair, rug, or rubber doormat to push the person away from the source of the current. Do not use a wet or metal object. If possible, stand on something dry that doesn't conduct electricity, such as a rubber mat or folded newspapers.  4. Once the person is away from the source of electricity, check the person's airway, breathing, and pulse. If either has stopped or seems dangerously slow or shallow, start first aid.   5. If the person has a burn, remove any clothing that comes off easily and rinse the burned area in cool, running water until the pain subsides. Give first aid for burns.  6. If the person is faint, pale, or shows other signs of shock, lay him or her down, with the head slightly lower than the trunk of the body and the legs elevated, and cover him or her with a warm blanket or a coat.  7. Stay with the person until medical help arrives.  8. Electrical injury is frequently associated with explosions or falls that can cause additional severe injuries. You may not be able to notice all of them. Do not move the person's head or neck if the spine may be injured.  9. If you are a passenger in a vehicle struck by a power line, remain in it until help arrives unless a fire has started. If necessary, try to jump out of the vehicle so that you do not maintain contact with it while also touching the ground.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000053.htm
Answer: The human body conducts electricity very well. That means electricity passes very easily throughout the body. Direct contact with electrical current can be deadly. While some electrical burns look minor, there still may be serious internal damage, especially to the heart, muscles, or brain.  Electric current can cause injury in three ways:  - Cardiac arrest due to the electrical effect on the heart  - Muscle, nerve, and tissue destruction from a current passing through the body  - Thermal burns from contact with the electrical source)

ADAM_0003800_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Swallowing difficulty ? (Also called: Dysphagia; Impaired swallowing; Choking - food; Globus sensation)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007543.htm
Answer: The process of swallowing involves several steps. These include   - Chewing food  - Moving it into the back of the mouth  - Moving it down the esophagus (the tube that moves food to the stomach)    There are many nerves that help the muscles of the mouth, throat, and esophagus work together. Much of swallowing occurs without you being aware of what you are doing.  A brain or nerve disorder can alter the workings of the muscles of the mouth and throat.  Swallowing is a complex act. Many nerves work in a fine balance to control how the muscles of the mouth, throat, and esophagus work together.  A brain or nerve disorder can alter this fine balance in the muscles of the mouth and throat.  - Damage to the brain may be caused by multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, or stroke.  - Nerve damage may be due to spinal cord injuries, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease), or myasthenia gravis.    Stress or anxiety may cause some people to feel tightness in the throat, or feel as if something is stuck in the throat. This sensation is unrelated to eating and is called globus hystericus.  Problems that involve the esophagus often cause swallowing problems. These may include:  - An abnormal ring of tissue that forms where the esophagus and stomach meet (called Schatzki's ring)  - Abnormal spasms of the esophagus muscles  - Cancer of the esophagus  - Failure of the muscle ring at the bottom of the esophagus to relax (Achalasia)  - Scarring that narrows the esophagus. This may be due to radiation, chemicals, medicines, chronic swelling, ulcers, or infection.  - Something stuck in the esophagus, such as a piece of food.  - Scleroderma, a disorder in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the esophagus  - Tumors in the chest that press on the esophagus)

ADAM_0000179_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Am I in labor? (Also called: False labor; Braxton Hicks contractions; Prodromal labor; Latent labor; Pregnancy - labor)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000508.htm
Answer: Summary : If you've never given birth before, you may think you'll just know when the time comes. In reality, it isn't always easy to know when you're going into labor. The steps leading up to labor can drag on for days.  Keep in mind that your due date is just a general idea of when your labor may start. Normal term labor can start any time between 3 weeks before and 2 weeks after this date.

False labor (Braxton Hicks contractions) : Most pregnant women feel mild contractions before true labor begins. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions, which:  - Are typically short  - Are not painful  - Do not come at regular intervals  - Are not accompanied by bleeding, leaking fluid, or decreased fetal movement    This stage is called ""prodromal"" or ""latent"" labor.

Other signs that labor is near : Lightening: This happens when your baby's head ""drops"" down into your pelvis.   - Your belly will look lower. It will be easier for you to breathe because the baby is not putting pressure on your lungs.  - You may need to urinate more often because the baby is pressing on your bladder.  - For first-time mothers, lightening often happens a few weeks before birth. For women who have had babies before, it may not happen until labor has begun.    Bloody show: If you have bloody or brownish discharge from your vagina, it may mean your cervix has begun to dilate. The mucous plug that sealed your cervix for the last 9 months may be visible. This is a good sign. But active labor may still be days away.   Your baby moves less: If you feel less movement, call your doctor or midwife, as sometimes decreased movement can mean that the baby is in trouble.   Your water breaks: When the amniotic sac (bag of fluid around the baby) breaks, you will feel fluid leak from your vagina. It may come out in a trickle or a gush.   - For most women, contractions come within 24 hours after the bag of water breaks.  - Even if contractions don't begin, let your doctor or midwife know as soon as you think your water has broken.    Diarrhea: Some women have the urge to go to the bathroom often to empty their bowels. If this happens and your stools are looser than normal, you may be going into labor.   Nesting: There's no science behind the theory, but plenty of women feel the sudden urge to ""nest"" right before labor starts. If you feel the need to vacuum the entire house at 3 a.m., or finish your work in the baby's nursery, you may be getting ready for labor.

True labor : In real labor, your contractions will:   - Come regularly and get closer together  - Last from 30 to 70 seconds, and will get longer  - Not stop, no matter what you do  - Radiate (reach) into your lower back and upper belly  - Get stronger or become more intense as time goes on  - Make you unable to talk to other people or laugh at a joke

When to call the doctor or midwife : Call your doctor or midwife right away if you have:   - Leaking amniotic fluid  - Decreased fetal movement  - Any vaginal bleeding other than light spotting  - Regular, painful contractions every 5 to 10 minutes for 60 minutes   Call for any other reason if you are unsure what to do.)

ADAM_0000671_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Cant sleep? Try these tips
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000853.htm
Answer: Summary : Everyone has trouble sleeping some of the time. But if it happens often, lack of sleep can affect your health and make it hard to get through the day. Learn lifestyle tips that can help you get the rest you need.

What you can do : Some people have trouble falling asleep. Others wake up in the middle of the night and cannot get back to sleep. You can change your habits and your home to make sleep less fleeting.   Stick to a sleep schedule:  - Go to bed and get up at the same time. Going to sleep at the same time every night trains your body and brain to wind down and get ready for slumber.  - Get up if you cannot sleep. If you lay awake for 15 minutes, get out of bed and go to another part of the house. This way your bed is less likely to become a place of stress.  - Do something quiet and relaxing like read a book. This can also help take your mind of the fact that you are not sleeping. When you feel drowsy, return to bed.    Make your bedroom comfortable:  - Get a comfortable mattress. If your mattress is lumpy, too soft, or too hard, it will be hard to get comfortable enough for sleep.  - Keep it cool. Your body temperature goes down when you sleep. Make sure your bedroom is cool enough but not so cool that you wake up cold. Experiment with the thermostat and blankets to find what temperature works for you.  - Control the light. Light from the street, a TV, or the next room can make it hard to stay asleep. Use curtains and doors to make your room dark so you can sleep. Or try using a sleep mask.  - Control sounds. Make your room as quiet as you can. You might use a fan, soft music, or sound machine to create white noise you can sleep to.  - Hide the clock. Watching the hours tick by can stress you out. Turn the clock so you cannot see it from your pillow.  - Put away electronics. Silence any device that reminds you of emails you need to send or things you need to do. You will be better off doing those things after a good night's sleep.    Practice Relaxation  Try different ways to relax. Find what works for you. Such as:  - Drink something warm and non-caffeinated like warm milk or herbal tea  - Take a warm shower or bath  - Read a book or magazine  - Listen to soft music or an audiobook  - Count backward from 300 by 3  - Meditate  - Starting at your feet and working your way up to your head, tense each group of muscles for a second or two and then relax them.  - Do belly breathing. Put your hand on your belly. Take a breath in, letting it push your hand out as your belly rises. Your chest should not move. Hold it for a count of 5, release for a count of 5. Repeat.    Live for Good Sleep  Things you do during the day can affect how well you sleep at night. You should:  - Limit evening activities. When you are on the run, your day may not end until late evening. Try to limit evening plans to a few nights a week. Give yourself time for a soothing bedtime ritual to help prepare you for sleep, such as a warm bath or reading in bed.  - Exercise. Regular exercise will help you sleep better. Just be sure you plan your workout right. Overtraining or exercising less than 3 hours before bedtime can make you toss and turn.  - Limit naps. If you are having trouble sleeping, cut out the catnaps. You will sleep better at night.  - Limit caffeine. It might be a helpful pick-up in the morning, but you may go to bed wired if you drink coffee, tea, or caffeinated sodas in the afternoon or evening.  - Limit alcohol. It may help you get to sleep at first, but alcohol keeps you from deep, restoring sleep later at night.  - Kick the habit. Need another reason to quit smoking? The nicotine in cigarettes can disrupt sleep.  - Eat smart. Avoid heavy meals before bedtime. Try to eat 2 or 3 hours before bedtime. If you feel hungry right before you go to bed, have a small, healthy snack like a small bowl of yogurt or sugar-free cereal.

When to Call Your Doctor : Call your health care provider if lack of sleep is interfering with your daily activities.)

ADAM_0002476_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Lymph node biopsy (Also called: Biopsy - lymph nodes; Open lymph node biopsy; Fine needle aspiration biopsy; Sentinel lymph node biopsy)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003933.htm
Answer: Summary : A lymph node biopsy is the removal of lymph node tissue for examination under a microscope.  The lymph nodes are small glands that make white blood cells (lymphocytes), which fight infection. Lymph nodes may trap the germs that are causing an infection. Canceroften spreads to lymph nodes.

How the Test is Performed : A lymph node biopsy is done in an operating room in a hospital. Or, it is done at an outpatient surgical center. The biopsy may be done in different ways.  An open biopsy is surgery to remove all or part of the lymph node:   - You lie on the examination table. You may be given medicine to calm you and make you sleepy.  - The biopsy site is cleansed.  - The health care provider injects a local anesthetic (numbing medication) into the area. Sometimes, general anesthesia is used, which means you are asleep and pain-free.  - A small surgical cut (incision)is made. The lymph node or part of the node is removed.   - Theincision is closed with stitches and a bandage is applied.  - An open biopsy may take 30to 45 minutes.   For some cancers, a special way of finding the best lymph node to biopsy is used. This is called sentinal lymph node biopsy, and it involves:  - A tiny amount of a tracer, either a radioactive tracer (radioisotope) or a blue dye, is injected at the tumor site.  - The tracer or dye flows into the nearest (local) node. This node is called the sentinel node.It is the first lymph node to whicha cancer spreads.  - The sentinel node and possibly one or two other lymph nodes are removed.   The sample is then sent to the laboratory for examination.  A needle biopsy involves inserting a needle into a lymph node. This type of biopsy is done less often because the results are not as helpful as with an open biopsy.

How to Prepare for the Test : Tell your health care provider:  - If you are pregnant  - If you have any drug allergies  - If you have bleeding problems  - What medications you are taking (including any supplements or herbal remedies)   Your doctor may ask you to:  - Stop taking any blood thinners, such as aspirin, heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), or clopidogrel (Plavix) 5to 10 days before the procedure  - Not eat or drink anything after a certain period of time before the biopsy  - Arrive at a certain time for the procedure   You must sign a consent form.

How the Test will Feel : When the local anesthetic is injected, you will feel a prick and a mild stinging. The biopsy site will be sore for a few days after the test.  After an open biopsy, the pain is mild and you can easily control it with an over-the-counter pain medication. You may also notice some bruising or fluid leaking for a few days. Theincision should heal in 10to 14 days. Follow instructions for taking care of the incision.While the incision is healing, avoid any type of intense exercise or heavy lifting.

Why the Test is Performed : The test is used to diagnose cancer, sarcoidosis,or an infection (such as tuberculosis):  - When you or your doctor feel swollen glands and they do not go away  - When lymph nodes are present on a CT or MRI scan  - For some patients with breast cancer or melanoma, to see if the cancer has spread (sentinel lymph node biopsy)    The results of the biopsy help your doctor decide on further tests and treatments.

Normal Results : If a lymph node biopsy does not show any signs of cancer, it is more likely that other lymph nodes nearby are also cancer-free. This information can help the health care provider decide about further tests and treatments.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may be due to many different conditions, from very mild infections to cancer.  For example, enlarged lymph nodes may be due to:  - Cancers (breast, lung, oral)  - HIV  - Hodgkin lymphoma  - Infection (tuberculosis, cat scratch disease)  - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma  - Sarcoidosis

Risks : - Bleeding  - Infection (in rare cases, the wound may get infected and you may need to take antibiotics)  - Nerve injury if the biopsy is done on a lymph node close to nerves (the numbness usually goes away in a few months))

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003737.htm
Answer: Summary : Lymph node culture is a laboratory test done on a sample from a lymph node to identify germs that cause infection.

How the Test is Performed : A sample is needed from a lymph node. The sample may be taken using a needle to draw fluid (aspiration) from the lymph node or during a lymph node biopsy.  The sample is sent to a laboratory. There, it is placed in a special dish and watched to see if bacteria, fungi, or viruses grow. This process is called a culture. Sometimes, special stains are also used to identify specific cells or microorganisms before culture results are available.  If needle aspiration does not provide a good enough sample, the entire lymph node may be removed and sent for culture and other testing.

How to Prepare for the Test : Your health care provider will instruct you on how to prepare for the lymph node sampling.

How the Test will Feel : When local anesthetic is injected, you will feel a prick and a mild stinging sensation. The site will likely be sore for a few days after the test.

Why the Test is Performed : Your doctor may order this test if you have swollen glands and infection is suspected.

Normal Results : A normal result means there was no growth of microorganisms on the lab dish.  Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results are a sign of a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection.

Risks : Risks may include:   - Bleeding  - Infection (in rare cases, the wound may get infected and you may need to take antibiotics)  - Nerve injury if the biopsy is done on a lymph node close to nerves (the numbness usually goes away in a few months))

Answer: Summary : White matter is found in the deeper tissues of the brain (subcortical). It contains nerve fibers (axons), which are extensions of nerve cells (neurons). Many of these nerve fibers are surrounded by a type of sheath or covering called myelin. Myelin gives the white matter its color. It also protects the nerve fibers from injury and improves the speed and transmission of electrical nerve signals.   By comparison, gray matter is tissue found on the surface of the brain (cortical). It contains the cell bodies of neurons, which give gray matter its color.)

(Also called: CACH syndrome; childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination; Cree leukoencephalopathy; myelinosis centralis diffusa; vanishing white matter disease; vanishing white matter leukodystrophy)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/leukoencephalopathy-with-vanishing-white-matter
Answer: Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is a progressive disorder that mainly affects the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). This disorder causes deterioration of the central nervous system's white matter, which consists of nerve fibers covered by myelin. Myelin is the fatty substance that insulates and protects nerves.  In most cases, people with leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter show no signs or symptoms of the disorder at birth. Affected children may have slightly delayed development of motor skills such as crawling or walking. During early childhood, most affected individuals begin to develop motor symptoms, including abnormal muscle stiffness (spasticity) and difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia). There may also be some deterioration of mental functioning, but this is not usually as pronounced as the motor symptoms. Some affected females may have abnormal development of the ovaries (ovarian dysgenesis). Specific changes in the brain as seen using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are characteristic of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, and may be visible before the onset of symptoms.  While childhood onset is the most common form of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, some severe forms are apparent at birth. A severe, early-onset form seen among the Cree and Chippewayan populations of Quebec and Manitoba is called Cree leukoencephalopathy. Milder forms may not become evident until adolescence or adulthood, when behavioral or psychiatric problems may be the first signs of the disease. Some females with milder forms of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter who survive to adolescence exhibit ovarian dysfunction. This variant of the disorder is called ovarioleukodystrophy.  Progression of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is generally uneven, with periods of relative stability interrupted by episodes of rapid decline. People with this disorder are particularly vulnerable to stresses such as infection, mild head trauma or other injury, or even extreme fright. These stresses may trigger the first symptoms of the condition or worsen existing symptoms, and can cause affected individuals to become lethargic or comatose.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/leukoencephalopathy-with-vanishing-white-matter
Answer: Mutations in the EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4, and EIF2B5 genes cause leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter.  The EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4 and EIF2B5 genes provide instructions for making the five parts (subunits) of a protein called eIF2B. The eIF2B protein helps regulate overall protein production (synthesis) in the cell by interacting with another protein, eIF2. The eIF2 protein is called an initiation factor because it is involved in starting (initiating) protein synthesis. Proper regulation of protein synthesis is vital for ensuring that the correct levels of protein are available for the cell to cope with changing conditions. For example, cells must synthesize protein much faster if they are multiplying than if they are in a resting state.  Mutations have been identified in all five of the genes from which the eIF2B protein is produced, although most of these mutations (about 65 percent) occur in the EIF2B5 gene. These mutations cause partial loss of eIF2B function in various ways. For example, they may impair the ability of one of the protein subunits to form a complex with the others, or make it more difficult for the protein to attach to the initiation factor.  Partial loss of eIF2B function makes it more difficult for the body's cells to regulate protein synthesis and deal with changing conditions and stress. Researchers believe that cells in the white matter may be particularly affected by an abnormal response to stress, resulting in the signs and symptoms of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter.)

GHR_0000910_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) sick sinus syndrome ? (Also called: sinus node disease; sinus node dysfunction; SND; SSS)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/sick-sinus-syndrome
Answer: Sick sinus syndrome (also known as sinus node dysfunction) is a group of related heart conditions that can affect how the heart beats. ""Sick sinus"" refers to the sino-atrial (SA) node, which is an area of specialized cells in the heart that functions as a natural pacemaker. The SA node generates electrical impulses that start each heartbeat. These signals travel from the SA node to the rest of the heart, signaling the heart (cardiac) muscle to contract and pump blood. In people with sick sinus syndrome, the SA node does not function normally. In some cases, it does not produce the right signals to trigger a regular heartbeat. In others, abnormalities disrupt the electrical impulses and prevent them from reaching the rest of the heart.  Sick sinus syndrome tends to cause the heartbeat to be too slow (bradycardia), although occasionally the heartbeat is too fast (tachycardia). In some cases, the heartbeat rapidly switches from being too fast to being too slow, a condition known as tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome. Symptoms related to abnormal heartbeats can include dizziness, light-headedness, fainting (syncope), a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), and confusion or memory problems. During exercise, many affected individuals experience chest pain, difficulty breathing, or excessive tiredness (fatigue). Once symptoms of sick sinus syndrome appear, they usually worsen with time. However, some people with the condition never experience any related health problems.  Sick sinus syndrome occurs most commonly in older adults, although it can be diagnosed in people of any age. The condition increases the risk of several life-threatening problems involving the heart and blood vessels. These include a heart rhythm abnormality called atrial fibrillation, heart failure, cardiac arrest, and stroke.)

GHR_0000910_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to sick sinus syndrome ? (Also called: sinus node disease; sinus node dysfunction; SND; SSS)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/sick-sinus-syndrome
Answer: Sick sinus syndrome can result from genetic or environmental factors. In many cases, the cause of the condition is unknown.  Genetic changes are an uncommon cause of sick sinus syndrome. Mutations in two genes, SCN5A and HCN4, have been found to cause the condition in a small number of families. These genes provide instructions for making proteins called ion channels that transport positively charged atoms (ions) into cardiac cells, including cells that make up the SA node. The flow of these ions is essential for creating the electrical impulses that start each heartbeat and coordinate contraction of the cardiac muscle. Mutations in these genes reduce the flow of ions, which alters the SA node's ability to create and spread electrical signals. These changes lead to abnormal heartbeats and the other symptoms of sick sinus syndrome.  A particular variation in another gene, MYH6, appears to increase the risk of developing sick sinus syndrome. The protein produced from the MYH6 gene forms part of a larger protein called myosin, which generates the mechanical force needed for cardiac muscle to contract. Researchers believe that the MYH6 gene variation changes the structure of myosin, which can affect cardiac muscle contraction and increase the likelihood of developing an abnormal heartbeat.  More commonly, sick sinus syndrome is caused by other factors that alter the structure or function of the SA node. These include a variety of heart conditions, other disorders such as muscular dystrophy, abnormal inflammation, or a shortage of oxygen (hypoxia). Certain medications, such as drugs given to treat abnormal heart rhythms or high blood pressure, can also disrupt SA node function. One of the most common causes of sick sinus syndrome in children is trauma to the SA node, such as damage that occurs during heart surgery.  In older adults, sick sinus syndrome is often associated with age-related changes in the heart. Over time, the SA node may harden and develop scar-like damage (fibrosis) that prevents it from working properly.)

Answer: During sleep, all of the muscles in the body become more relaxed. This includes the muscles that help keep the throat open so air can flow into the lungs.  Normally, the throat remains open enough during sleep to let air pass by. However, some children have a narrow throat. This is often this is because of large tonsils or adenoids, which partially block the airflow. When the muscles in their upper throat relax during sleep, the tissues close in and block the airway. This stop in breathing is called apnea.  Other factors that also may increase the risk of sleep apnea in children include:  - A small jaw  - Certain shapes of the roof of the mouth (palate)   - Large tongue, which may fall back and block the airway  - Obesity  - Poor muscle tone due to conditions such as Down syndrome or cerebral palsy)

Answer: Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes your breathing to stop or get very shallow. Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour.    The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during sleep. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea.    You are more at risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight, male, or have a family history or small airways. Children with enlarged tonsils may also get it.    Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and sleep study results.    When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes, work-related accidents, and other medical problems. If you have it, it is important to get treatment.

NHLBI_0000118_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Sleep Apnea ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sleepapnea
Answer: Espaol
                
Sleep apnea (AP-ne-ah) is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.
                
Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30times or more an hour. Typically, normal breathing then starts again, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound.
                
Sleep apnea usually is a chronic (ongoing) condition that disrupts your sleep. When your breathing pauses or becomes shallow, youll often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep.
                
As a result, the quality of your sleep is poor, which makes you tired during the day. Sleep apnea is a leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness.
                
Overview
                
Sleep apnea often goes undiagnosed. Doctors usually can't detect the condition during routine office visits. Also, no blood test can help diagnose the condition.
                
Most people who have sleep apnea don't know they have it because it only occurs during sleep. A family member or bed partner might be the first to notice signs of sleep apnea.
                
The most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea. In this condition, the airway collapses or becomes blocked during sleep. This causes shallow breathing or breathing pauses.
                
When you try to breathe, any air that squeezes past the blockage can cause loud snoring. Obstructive sleep apnea is more common in people who are overweight, but it can affect anyone. For example, small children who have enlarged tonsil tissues in their throats may have obstructive sleep apnea.

The animation shows how the airway can collapse and block air flow to the lungs, causing sleep apnea.
                
Central sleep apnea is a less common type of sleep apnea. This disorder occurs if the area of your brain that controls your breathing doesn't send the correct signals to your breathing muscles. As a result, you'll make no effort to breathe for brief periods.
                
Central sleep apnea can affect anyone. However, it's more common in people who have certain medical conditions or use certain medicines.
                
Central sleep apnea can occur with obstructive sleep apnea or alone. Snoring typically doesn't happen with central sleep apnea.
                
This article mainly focuses on obstructive sleep apnea.
                
Outlook
                
Untreated sleep apnea can:
                
Increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, obesity, and diabetes
                
Increase the risk of, or worsen, heart failure
                
Make arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), or irregular heartbeats, more likely
                
Increase the chance of having work-related or driving accidents
                
Sleep apnea is a chronic condition that requires long-term management. Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can successfully treat sleep apnea in many people.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001944.htm
Answer: Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.  TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50 -- coma  - 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death    You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.  HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL  Alcohol increases the risk of:  - Alcoholism  - Falls, drownings, and other accidents  - Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers  - Motor vehicle accidents  - Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  - Suicide and homicide    Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.  RESPONSIBLE DRINKING  If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.  Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:  - Never drink alcohol and drive a car.  - If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.  - Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.    If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.  If alcohol use runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.  CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:  - You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member  - You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use or support groups  - You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking    Other resources include:  - Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups  - Local hospitals  - Public or private mental health agencies  - School or work counselors  - Student or employee health centers)

Answer: Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. When an asthma attack occurs, the lining of the air passages swells and the muscles surrounding the airways become tight. This reduces the amount of air that can pass through the airway.  In people who have sensitive airways, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing insubstances called allergens or triggers.

ADAM_0000787_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Child safety seats (Also called: Child car seats; Infant car seats; Car seats; Car safety seats)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000670.htm
Answer: Summary : Child safety seats are proven to save children's lives in accidents.  In the United States, all states require children to be secured in a car seat or booster seat until they are 4' 9"" tall. Most children grow to this height when they are between 8 and 12 years old.  To keep your child safe, keep these tips in mind when using a car safety seat.  - When your child is born, you must have a car seat to bring the baby home from the hospital.  - Always secure your child in a car seat whenever riding in a vehicle. Make sure the harness is fastened snugly.  - Read the car seat manufacturer's instructions for the proper way to use the seat. Read your vehicle owner's manual, too.  - Car seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. If there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. This can ONLY be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off.    When you are selecting a child safety seat for the first time:  - The seat must fit your child's size and be able to be properly installed in your vehicle.  - It is best to use a new car seat. Used car seats often do not have instructions. They may have cracks or other problems that make the seat unsafe. For example, the seat may have been damaged during a car accident.  - Try the seat before buying it. Install the seat in your vehicle. Put your child in the car seat. Secure the harness and buckle. Check that the seat fits your vehicle and child.  - DO NOT use a car seat past its expiration date. The seat frame may no longer be strong enough to support your child safely. The expiration date is usually on the bottom of the seat.  - DO NOT use a seat that has been recalled. Fill out and send in the registration card that comes with the new car seat. The manufacturer can contact you if the seat is recalled. You can find out about recalls by contacting the manufacturer, or by looking up safety complaints records on your child's safety seat at www.safercar.gov/parents/CarSeats/Car-Seat-Safety.htm.    The types of child safety seats and restraints include:  - Rear-facing seats  - Forward-facing seats  - Booster seats  - Car beds  - Built-in car seats  - Travel vests    REAR-FACING SEATS   A rear-facing seat is one in which your child faces the back of the vehicle. The seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle. The two types of rear-facing seats are the infant-only seat and the convertible seat.  Infant-only rear-facing seats. These seats are for babies who weigh up to 22 to 30 pounds, depending on the car seat. You will need a new seat when your child gets bigger. Infant-only seats have handles so you can carry the seat to and from the car. Some have a base you can leave installed in the car. This lets you click the car seat into place each time you use it. Follow manufacturer's instructions on how the seat should be reclined so your baby's head does not shift around while you are driving.  Convertible seats. These seats are to be placed in the rear-facing position and are for infants and toddlers. When your child is older and bigger, the seat can be switched to the forward-facing position. Experts recommend keeping your child rear-facing until at least age 2 and until your child outgrows the weight or height allowed by the seat.  FORWARD-FACING SEATS   A forward-facing seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle, although it allows your child to face the front of the car. These seats are used only after your child is too big for a rear-facing seat.  A combination forward-facing booster seat may also be used. For younger children, the booster seat's harness straps should be used. After your child reaches the upper height and weight limit for the harness (based on the seat's instructions), the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts can be used to keep your child strapped in.   BOOSTER SEATS  A booster seat raises your child up so the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts fit correctly. The lap belt should fall across your child's upper thighs. The shoulder belt should go across the middle of your child's shoulder and chest.  Use booster seats for older children until they are 4' 9"" tall and between 8 and 12 years old.  CAR BEDS  These seats are also called flat car seats. They are used for premature or other special-needs babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends having a health care provider look at how your preterm baby fits and breathes in a car seat before leaving the hospital.  BUILT-IN SEATS  Some vehicles have built-in car seats. Weight and height limits vary. You can get more details on these seats by reading the vehicle owner's manual or calling the vehicle manufacturer.  TRAVEL VESTS  Special vests can be worn by older children who have outgrown forward-facing safety seats. The vests can be used instead of booster seats. The vests are used with the vehicle's lap and seat belts. As with car seats, children should be sitting in the back seat when using the vest.)

ADAM_0001279_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Drinking water safely during cancer treatment
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000060.htm
Answer: Summary : During and right after your cancer treatment, your body cannot protect itself against infections. Tiny germs can be in water, even when it looks clean. You need to be careful where you get your water from. This includes water for drinking, cooking, and brushing your teeth. Ask your doctor or nurse about special care you should take.

Tap water : Tap water is water from your faucet. It should be safe when it comes from:  - A city water supply  - A city well that supplies many people with water    If you live in a small city or town, check with your local water department. Ask if they test the water every day for the kind of germs that can give you an infection -- germs are called coliforms.

Well water : Boil water from a private well or a small community well before you drink it or use it for cooking or brushing your teeth.  Running well water through a filter or adding chlorine to it does not make it safe to use. Test your well water at least once a year for coliform germs that may cause an infection. Test your water more often if coliforms are found in it or if there is any question about the safety of your water.  To boil water and store it:  - Heat the water to a rolling boil.  - Keep the water boiling for at least 1 minute.  - After boiling the water, store it in the refrigerator in a clean and covered container.  - Use all this water within 3 days (72 hours). If you do not use it in this time, pour it down the drain or use it to water your plants or your garden.

Bottled water : The label on any bottled water you drink should say how it was cleaned. Look for these words:  - Reverse osmosis filtration  - Distillation or distilled

Water filters : Tap water should be safe when it comes from a city water supply or a city well that supplies many people with water. It does not need to be filtered.  You should boil water that comes from a private well or a small local well, even if you have a filter.  Many sink filters, filters in refrigerators, pitchers that use filters, and some filters for camping do not remove germs.  If you have a home water-filtering system (such as a filter under your sink), change the filter as often as the manufacturer recommends.)

ADAM_0003450_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Safe driving for teens (Also called: Driving and teenagers; Teens and safe driving; Automobile safety - teenage drivers)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001930.htm
Answer: Summary : Learning to drive is an exciting time for teenagers and their parents. It opens up many options for a young person, but it also carries risks. Young people between ages 15 and 24 have the highest rate of auto-related deaths. The rate is the highest for young men.   Parents and teens should be aware of problem areas and take steps to avoid hazards.

Information : Make a Commitment to Safety  Teens also need to commit to being safe and responsible drivers in order to improve the odds in their favor.  - Reckless driving is still a danger to teens -- even with automobile safety features.  - All new drivers should take a driver's education course. These courses can reduce risk for crashes.    Drivers and passengers should use automobile safety features at all times. These include: seat belts, shoulder straps, and headrests. Only drive cars that have air bags, padded dashes, safety glass, collapsible steering columns, and anti-lock brakes.  Auto accidents are also a leading cause of death in infants and children. Infants and young children should be properly buckled into a child safety seat of the right size that is correctly installed in the vehicle.  Avoid Distracted Driving   Distractions are a problem for all drivers. Do not use cell phones for talking, texting, or email when you are driving.   - Mobile phones should be turned off when driving so you are not tempted to make calls, send or read texts, or answer the phone.  - If phones are left on for emergency use, pull off of the road before answering or texting.    Other tips include:  - Avoid putting on makeup while driving, even when stopped at a light or stop sign, it can be dangerous.  - Finish eating before starting your car and driving.    Driving with friends can lead to accidents.  - Teens are safer driving alone or with family. For the first 6 months, teens should drive with an adult driver who can help them learn good driving habits.  - New drivers should wait at least 3 to 6 months before taking friends as passengers.    Teenage-related driving deaths occur more often in certain conditions.  Other safety tips for teens  - Reckless driving is still a danger, even when using seatbelts. Do not rush. It is safer to be late.  - Avoid driving at nighttime. Your driving skills and reflexes are just developing during the first months of driving. Darkness adds an extra factor to cope with.  - When drowsy, stop driving until fully alert. Sleepiness may cause more accidents than alcohol.  - Never drink and drive. Drinking slows reflexes and hurts judgment. These effects happen to anyone who drinks. So, NEVER drink and drive. ALWAYS find someone to drive who has not been drinking -- even if this means making an uncomfortable phone call.  - Drugs can be just as dangerous as alcohol. Do not mix driving with marijuana, other illegal drugs or any prescribedmedicine that makes you sleepy.   Parents should talk with their teens about ""household driving rules.""  - Make a written ""driving contract"" that both parents and teens sign.  - The contract should include a list of driving rules and what teens can expect if the rules are broken.  - The contract should state that parents have the final say about the driving rules.  - When writing the contract, take into account all of the driving issues that are likely to come up.    Parents can do the following to help prevent teens from drinking and driving:  - Tell their teens to call rather than get in a car with a driver who has been drinking or when they have been drinking. Promise no punishment if they call first.    Some children continue to mix driving and drinking. In many states, the parent must sign for a teenager under 18 to get a driver's license. At any time before the 18th birthday a parent can refuse responsibility and the state will take the license.)

ADAM_0003451_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Safe eating during cancer treatment
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000061.htm
Answer: Summary : When you have cancer, you need good nutrition to help keep your body strong. To do this you need to watch the foods you eat and how you prepare them.  Some raw foods can contain germs that can hurt you when cancer or treatment weakens your immune system. Ask your doctor or nurse about how to eat well but safely.  When you eat eggs:  - Yolks and whites should be cooked solid. Do not eat runny eggs.  - Do not eat foods that may have raw eggs in them (such as Caesar salad dressing, cookie dough, cake batter, and hollandaise sauce).    Be careful when you have dairy products:  - All milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy should have the word pasteurized on their containers.  - Do not eat soft cheeses or cheeses with blue veins (such as Brie, Camembert, Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola, and Bleu).  - Do not eat Mexican-style cheeses (such as queso blanco fresco and cojita).    Fruits and vegetables:  - Wash all raw fruits, vegetables, and fresh herbs with cold running water.  - Do not eat raw vegetable sprouts (such as alfalfa and mung bean).  - Do not use fresh salsa or salad dressings that are kept in the refrigerated cases of the grocery store.  - Drink only juice that says pasteurized on the container.    Do not eat raw honey. Eat only heat-treated honey. Avoid sweets that have creamy fillings.

Cook foods safely : When you cook, make sure you cook your food long enough.  Do not eat uncooked tofu. Cook tofu for at least 5 minutes.  When eating chicken and other poultry:  - Cook whole pieces of poultry to 180 F.  - Cook ground poultry to 165 F.    If you cook beef, lamb, pork, or venison:  - Do not eat raw mean, such as Japanese sashimi.  - Make sure meat is not red or pink before you eat it.  - Cook meat to 160 F.    When eating fish, oysters, and other shellfish:  - Do not eat raw fish (such as sushi), raw oysters, or any other raw shellfish.  - Make sure all fish and shellfish you eat is cooked thoroughly.    Heat all casseroles to 165 F. Warm hot dogs and lunch meats to steaming before you eat them.

Be careful when you eat out : When you dine out, stay away from:  - Raw fruits and vegetables  - Salad bars, buffets, sidewalk vendors, potlucks, and delis    Ask if all fruit juices are pasteurized.  Use only salad dressings, sauces, and salsas from single-serving packages. Eat out at times when restaurants are less crowded. Always ask for your food to be prepared fresh, even at fast food restaurants.)

ADAM_0003452_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Safe sex
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001949.htm
Answer: Summary : Safe sex means taking steps before and during sex that can prevent you from getting an infection, or from giving an infection to your partner.

Information : A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that can be spread to another person through sexual contact. STIs include:  - Chlamydia  - Genital herpes  - Genital warts  - Gonorrhea  - Hepatitis  - HIV  - HPV  - Syphilis    STIs are also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  These infections are spread by direct contact with a sore on the genitals or mouth, body fluids, or sometimes the skin around the genital area.  Before having sex:  - Get to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories  - Don't feel forced into having sex  - Don't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner    Your sexual partner should be someone who you know does not have any STI. Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs and share the test results with each other.  If you know you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know this before you have sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.  Use condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.  - The condom should be in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.  - Keep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with skin areas around the genitals. A condom reduces but does not eliminate your risk of getting an STI.    Other tips include:   - Use lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.  - Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.  - Polyurethane condoms are less likely to break than latex condoms, but they cost more.  - Using condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may increase the chance of HIV transmission.  - Stay sober. Alcohol and drugs impair your judgment. When you are not sober, you might not choose your partner as carefully. You may also forget to use condoms, or use them incorrectly.    Get tested regularly for STIs if you have new sexual partners. Most STIs have no symptoms, so you need to be tested often if there is any chance you have been exposed. You will have the best outcome and will be less likely to spread the infection if you are diagnosed early.  Women should consider getting the HPV vaccine to keep from getting the human papillomavirus. This virus can put you at risk for vaginal warts and cervical cancer.)

ADAM_0003842_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Taking multiple medicines safely
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000883.htm
Answer: Summary : If you take more than one medicine, it is important to take them carefully and safely. Some medicines can interact and cause side effects. It can also be hard to keep track of when and how to take each medicine.  Here are tips to help you keep track of your medicines and take them as directed.

Why you may Need More Than one Medicine : You may take more than one medicine to treat a single condition. Or you may take different medicines to treat more than one health problem. For example, you may take a statin to lower your cholesterol, and a beta-blocker to control your blood pressure.   Older adults often have more than one health condition. So they are more likely to take several medicines.

Risks of Taking Multiple Medicines : The more medicines you take, the more you need to use them carefully. There are several risks when taking multiple medicines.  - You may be more likely to have side effects. Because most medicines can have side effects, the more medicines you take, the more likely you will have side effects. Taking certain medicines can also increase the risk of falls.  - You are at higher risk for drug interactions. An interaction is when one medicine affects how another medicine works. For example, taken together, one medicine may make the other medicine stronger. Medicines can also interact with alcohol and even some foods. Some interactions can be serious, even life threatening.  - You may find it hard to keep track of when to take each medicine. You even may forget which medicine you have taken at a certain time.  - You may take a medicine you do not need. This may be more likely to happen if you see more than one health care provider. You may be prescribed different medicines for the same problem.

People at Higher Risk : Certain people are more likely to have problems from taking multiple medicines:  - People who are prescribed 5 or more medicines. The more medicines you take, the higher the chance of interactions or side effects. You may also find it hard to remember all possible drug interactions.  - People who take medicines prescribed by more than one provider. One provider may not know that you are taking medicines another provider has given you.  - Older adults. As you age, your body processes medicines differently. For instance, your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. This can mean that more medicine stays in your body for longer. This can lead to dangerous levels of medicines in your system.  - People in the hospital. When you are in the hospital, you will likely see new providers who are not familiar with your health history. Without this knowledge, they may prescribe a medicine that may interact with medicines you already take.

What you can do : These suggestions can help you take all of your medicines safely:  - Keep a list of all medicines you take. Your list should include all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. OTC medicines include vitamins, supplements, and herbal products. Keep a copy of the list in your wallet and at home.  - Review your medicine list with your health care providers and pharmacists. Discuss the list with your provider each time you have an appointment. Ask your provider if you still need to take all of the medicines on your list. Also ask if any of the dosages should be changed. Make sure you give all of your providers a copy of your medicine list.  - Ask questions about any new drugs you are prescribed. Make sure you understand how to take them. Also ask if a new medicine could interact with any of the medicines or supplements you are already taking.  - Take your medicines exactly as your provider tells you. If you have questions about how or why to take your medicine, ask your provider. DO NOT skip doses, or stop taking your medicines.  - If you notice side effects, tell your health care provider. DO NOT stop taking your medicines unless your provider tells you to.  - Keep your medicines organized. There are many ways to keep track of your medicines. A pill organizer may help. Try one or more methods and see what works for you.  - If you have a hospital stay, bring your medicine list with you. Talk with your provider about medicine safety while you are in the hospital.

When to Call the Doctor : Call if you have questions or you are confused about the directions for your medicine. Call if you have any side effects from your medicines. DO NOT stop taking any medicine unless your health care provider tells you to stop.)

ADAM_0004154_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Using over-the-counter medicines safely
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm
Answer: Summary : Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are drugs you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using OTC the medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.  Here is what you need to know about OTC drugs.

About OTC Medicines : You can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:  - Drug stores  - Grocery stores  - Discount and department stores  - Convenience stores  - Some gas stations    When used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:  - Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea  - Preventing problems like heartburn or motion sickness  - Treating conditions such as athletes foot, allergies, or migraine headaches  - Providing first aid

When Should you Use OTC Medicines : It is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:  - Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition  - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take  - What side effects or problems to watch for    Your pharmacist can answer questions such as:  - What the medicine will do  - How it should be stored  - Whether another medicine might work as well or better

What the Label can Tell you : You can also get information about OTC drugs on the medicine label.  Most OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.  Here is what the label will show you:  - Active Ingredient. This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose.  - Uses. The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, DO NOT use the medicine for any condition not listed.  - Warnings. Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. Some medicines you should not take when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose.  - Directions. The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Fully read the directions, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages.  - Other information. This includes such things as how to store the medicine.  - Inactive ingredients. Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.    The label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.

Other Ways to Use OTC Medicines Safely : You should:  - Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with.  - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place you bought it.  - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container.  - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.    Also be sure to take steps to keep kids safe. You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight.)

GHR_0000037_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) allergic asthma ? (Also called: extrinsic asthma)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/allergic-asthma
Answer: Asthma is a breathing disorder characterized by inflammation of the airways and recurrent episodes of breathing difficulty. These episodes, sometimes referred to as asthma attacks, are triggered by irritation of the inflamed airways. In allergic asthma, the attacks occur when substances known as allergens are inhaled, causing an allergic reaction. Allergens are harmless substances that the body's immune system mistakenly reacts to as though they are harmful. Common allergens include pollen, dust, animal dander, and mold. The immune response leads to the symptoms of asthma. Allergic asthma is the most common form of the disorder.  A hallmark of asthma is bronchial hyperresponsiveness, which means the airways are especially sensitive to irritants and respond excessively. Because of this hyperresponsiveness, attacks can be triggered by irritants other than allergens, such as physical activity, respiratory infections, or exposure to tobacco smoke, in people with allergic asthma.  An asthma attack is characterized by tightening of the muscles around the airways (bronchoconstriction), which narrows the airway and makes breathing difficult. Additionally, the immune reaction can lead to swelling of the airways and overproduction of mucus. During an attack, an affected individual can experience chest tightness, wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing. Over time, the muscles around the airways can become enlarged (hypertrophied), further narrowing the airways.  Some people with allergic asthma have another allergic disorder, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or food allergies. Asthma is sometimes part of a series of allergic disorders, referred to as the atopic march. Development of these conditions typically follows a pattern, beginning with eczema (atopic dermatitis), followed by food allergies, then hay fever, and finally asthma. However, not all individuals with asthma have progressed through the atopic march, and not all individuals with one allergic disease will develop others.)

MPlusHealthTopics_0000080_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Bad Breath ? (Also called: Halitosis)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/badbreath.html
Answer: There are many reasons why you might have bad breath. You can get it if you don't brush and floss regularly. Bacteria that build up in your mouth and between your teeth produce the bad odor. Other problems in your mouth, such as gum disease, dry mouth or cavities, may also cause it. Sinusitis or problems with your nose may be to blame. You can also have bad breath if you eat some foods, like raw onions, garlic or cabbage. And of course smoking causes its own bad aroma. Some diseases and medicines are associated with a specific breath odor.      Having good dental habits, like brushing and flossing regularly, help fight bad breath. Mouthwashes, mints or chewing gum may make your breath fresher. If you have an underlying disorder, treating it may help eliminate the breath odor.)

ADAM_0000334_Sec9.txt,"Question: How to prevent Asthma ? (Also called: Bronchial asthma; Wheezing - asthma - adults)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000141.htm
Answer: You can reduce asthma symptoms by avoiding triggers and substances that irritate the airways.  - Cover bedding with allergy-proof casings to reduce exposure to dust mites.  - Remove carpets from bedrooms and vacuum regularly.  - Use only unscented detergents and cleaning materials in the home.  - Keep humidity levels low and fix leaks to reduce the growth of organisms such as mold.  - Keep the house clean and keep food in containers and out of bedrooms. This helps reduce the possibility of cockroaches. Body parts and droppingsfrom cockroachescan trigger asthma attacks in some people.  - If someone is allergic to an animal that cannot be removed from the home, the animal should be kept out of the bedroom. Place filtering material over the heating outlets to trap animal dander. Change the filter in furnaces and air conditioners often.  - Eliminate tobacco smoke from the home. This is the single most important thing a family can do to helpsomeone with asthma. Smoking outside the house is not enough. Family members and visitors who smoke outside carry smoke residue inside on their clothes and hair. This can trigger asthma symptoms. If you smoke, now is a good time to quit.  - Avoid air pollution, industrial dust, and irritating fumes as much as possible.)

ADAM_0001480_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Exercise and age (Also called: Age and exercise)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002080.htm
Answer: Summary : It is never too late to start exercising. Exercise has benefits at any age.  Don't worry if you have never exercised, or if you stopped exercising for some reason. Being physically active can help youto keep doingthe things you enjoy and stay independent as you age. The right kind of regular exercise can also reduce yourriskof heart disease, diabetes, and falls.  An effective exercise program needs to be fun and helps to keep you motivated. It helps to have a goal. Your goal might be to:  - Manage a health condition  - Reduce stress  - Improve your stamina  - Be able to buy clothes in a smaller size   Your exercise program mayalso be a way for you to socialize. Taking exercise classes or exercising with a friend are both good ways to be social.  You may have a hard time starting an exercise routine. Once you do start, though, you will begin to notice the benefits, including improved sleep and self-esteem.  Exercise and physical activity can also:  - Improve or maintain your strength and fitness  - Make it easier to do the things you want to do  - Help your balance and walking  - Help with feelings of depression or anxiety and improve your mood  - Maintain your thinking skills (cognitive function) as you get older  - Prevent or treat diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, breast and colon cancer, and osteoporosis   Always talk to your health care provider before starting an exercise program.Your provider can suggest exercises and activities that are right for you.  Exercises can be grouped into four main categories, although many exercises fit into more than one category:  AEROBIC EXERCISE   Aerobic exercise increases your breathing and heart rate. These exercises help your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. They may prevent or delay many diseases, such as diabetes, colon and breast cancers, and heart disease.  - Aerobic sports activities include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, biking, climbing, tennis, and basketball  - Aerobic activities you can do every day include dancing, yard work, pushing your grandchild on a swing, and vacuuming   MUSCLE STRENGTH  Improving your muscle strength can help you climb stairs, carry groceries, and stay independent. You can build muscle strength by:  - Lifting weights or using a resistance band  - Performing everyday activities, such as carrying a full laundry basket from the basement, carrying your smaller grandchildren, or lifting things in the garden    BALANCE EXERCISES  Balance exercises help prevent falls, which is a concern for older adults. Many exercises that strengthen the muscles in the legs, hips, and lower back will improve your balance. It is often best to learn balance exercises from a physical therapist before starting on your own.  Balance exercises may include:  - Standing on one foot  - Walking heel-to-toe  - Tai chi  - Standing on tiptoe to reach something on the top shelf  - Walking up and down the stairs    STRETCHING  Stretching can help your body stay flexible. To stay limber:  - Learn shoulder, upper arm, and calf stretches  - Take yoga classes  - Do everyday activities, such as making your bed or bending over to tie your shoes)

ADAM_0001484_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Exercise, lifestyle, and your bones (Also called: Osteoporosis - exercise; Low bone density - exercise)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000492.htm
Answer: Summary : Osteoporosis is a disease that causes bones to become brittle and more likely to fracture (break). With osteoporosis, the bones lose density. Bone density is the amount of bone tissue in your bones.   Exercise plays a key role in preserving bone density as you age.

Why Exercise? : Make exercise a regular part of your life. It helps keep your bones strong and lower your risk of osteoporosis and fractures as you get older.   Before you begin an exercise program, talk with your doctor if:   - You are older  - You have not been active for a while  - You have diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, or any other health condition

How Much and What Type of Exercise? : To build up bone density, the exercise must make your muscles pull on your bones. These are called weight-bearing exercises. Some of them are:   - Brisk walks, jogging, playing tennis, dancing, or other weight-bearing activities such as aerobics and other sports  - Careful weight training, using weight machines or free weights    Weight bearing exercises also:   - Increase bone density even in young people  - Help preserve bone density in women who are approaching menopause    To protect your bones, do weight bearing exercises 3 or more days a week for a total of over 90 minutes a week.   If you are older, do not do high-impact aerobics, such as step aerobics. This type of exercise may increase your risk of fractures.  Low-impact exercises, like yoga and tai chi, do not help bone density very much. But they can improve your balance and lower your risk of falling and breaking a bone. And, even though they are good for your heart, swimming and biking do not increase bone density.

Other Lifestyle Changes to Help Your Bones : If you smoke, quit. Also limit how much alcohol you drink. Too much alcohol can damage your bones and raise your risk of falling and breaking a bone.   If you do not get enough calcium, or if your body does not absorb enough calcium from the foods you eat, your body may not make enough new bone. Talk with your health care provider about calcium and your bones.   Vitamin D helps your body absorb enough calcium.   - Ask your health care provider if you should take a vitamin D supplement.  - You may need more vitamin D during the winter or if you need to avoid sun exposure to prevent skin cancer.  - Ask your health care provider about how much sun is safe for you.)

ADAM_0000179_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Am I in labor? (Also called: False labor; Braxton Hicks contractions; Prodromal labor; Latent labor; Pregnancy - labor)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000508.htm
Answer: Summary : If you've never given birth before, you may think you'll just know when the time comes. In reality, it isn't always easy to know when you're going into labor. The steps leading up to labor can drag on for days.  Keep in mind that your due date is just a general idea of when your labor may start. Normal term labor can start any time between 3 weeks before and 2 weeks after this date.

False labor (Braxton Hicks contractions) : Most pregnant women feel mild contractions before true labor begins. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions, which:  - Are typically short  - Are not painful  - Do not come at regular intervals  - Are not accompanied by bleeding, leaking fluid, or decreased fetal movement    This stage is called ""prodromal"" or ""latent"" labor.

Other signs that labor is near : Lightening: This happens when your baby's head ""drops"" down into your pelvis.   - Your belly will look lower. It will be easier for you to breathe because the baby is not putting pressure on your lungs.  - You may need to urinate more often because the baby is pressing on your bladder.  - For first-time mothers, lightening often happens a few weeks before birth. For women who have had babies before, it may not happen until labor has begun.    Bloody show: If you have bloody or brownish discharge from your vagina, it may mean your cervix has begun to dilate. The mucous plug that sealed your cervix for the last 9 months may be visible. This is a good sign. But active labor may still be days away.   Your baby moves less: If you feel less movement, call your doctor or midwife, as sometimes decreased movement can mean that the baby is in trouble.   Your water breaks: When the amniotic sac (bag of fluid around the baby) breaks, you will feel fluid leak from your vagina. It may come out in a trickle or a gush.   - For most women, contractions come within 24 hours after the bag of water breaks.  - Even if contractions don't begin, let your doctor or midwife know as soon as you think your water has broken.    Diarrhea: Some women have the urge to go to the bathroom often to empty their bowels. If this happens and your stools are looser than normal, you may be going into labor.   Nesting: There's no science behind the theory, but plenty of women feel the sudden urge to ""nest"" right before labor starts. If you feel the need to vacuum the entire house at 3 a.m., or finish your work in the baby's nursery, you may be getting ready for labor.

True labor : In real labor, your contractions will:   - Come regularly and get closer together  - Last from 30 to 70 seconds, and will get longer  - Not stop, no matter what you do  - Radiate (reach) into your lower back and upper belly  - Get stronger or become more intense as time goes on  - Make you unable to talk to other people or laugh at a joke

When to call the doctor or midwife : Call your doctor or midwife right away if you have:   - Leaking amniotic fluid  - Decreased fetal movement  - Any vaginal bleeding other than light spotting  - Regular, painful contractions every 5 to 10 minutes for 60 minutes   Call for any other reason if you are unsure what to do.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000427.htm
Answer: Some patients cannot safely leave their beds to bathe. For these people, daily bed baths can help keep their skin healthy, control odor, and increase comfort. If moving the patient causes pain, plan to give the patient a bed bath after the person has received pain medicine and it has taken affect.  A bed bath is a good time to inspect a patient's skin for redness and sores. Pay special attention to skin folds and bony areas when checking.)

ADAM_0000410_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Bed rest during pregnancy
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000581.htm
Answer: Summary : Your doctor's orders to stay in bed for a few days or weeks might seem like a welcome break. But you will find that bed rest during pregnancy can be as much work as it is a break.  You might not be able to work, do things around the house, or spend time with other family members the way you normally do. If you are on complete bed rest during pregnancy, you might not even be able to shower or eat when sitting up.  Bed rest means you will need to quickly adjust to doing things differently. You will need to find ways to pass the time and ask for help with all of your daily activities.

Why Do I Need Bed Rest? : Bed rest used to be recommended routinely for a number of pregnancy complications, including:  - High blood pressure  - Premature or preterm changes in the cervix  - Problems with the placenta  - Vaginal bleeding  - Early labor  - More than one baby  - History of early birth or miscarriage  - Baby is not growing well  - Baby has medical problems   Now, though, most health care providers have stopped recommending bed rest except in rare circumstances.   Bed rest does not guarantee that problems with your pregnancy will get better. It is just a safeguard.   It is important that you discuss with your provider exactly what bed rest means and what activities you can and cannot do.

What Is the Best Position for Bed Rest? : The best position for bed rest is on your side, with the left side being preferred and the right side as an alternative when the left gets sore. This is to relieve pressure on the large vein that carries blood back to the heart from your feet (called the inferior vena cava) and to prevent putting pressure on your liver. Avoid lying on your back for long periods of time as this puts the most pressure on the inferior vena cava.

How Can I Deal with Discomfort from Bed Rest? : Bed rest can make your body ache. Switching from side to side every so often will help move your muscles and relieve pressure.  Movement and activity will also help keep your blood flowing. Here are some exercises that may help. Talk to your provider before you start any activity:  - Squeezing stress balls  - Pressing your hands and feet against the bed  - Turning your arms and feet in circles  - Tensing or tightening your arm and leg muscles    Try not to use your belly muscles if you are stretching or exercising. Keep in mind that you should talk to your provider before you do any stretching or exercising while on bed rest.

What You Can or Cannot Do While on Bed Rest : The dos and don'ts during bed rest will depend on your situation and your provider. Most often, bed rest will require that you avoid:  - Lifting anything over 20 pounds  - Exercise (specifically, impact exercises that put pressure on your joints)  - Sex  - Prolonged standing

Ask Your Health Care Provider : If you should limit yourself from doing any of these:  - Cooking  - Light chores  - Walking  - Bathing or showering  - Driving  - Having sex    If you will be on bed rest for a long time, you will need to get enough movement each day to keep your blood circulating. Talk to your provider about safe activity you can do while on bed rest.

How to Cope with Bed Rest : Remember that each day of bed rest brings you one day closer to the birth. In the meantime, try to:  - Get organized. Make sure what you need is within reach, like a phone, laptop and other devices, drinks and snacks, the remote control, and extra pillows and blankets.  - Beat boredom. This is a great time to focus on the baby. Shop online for baby goods. Knit a baby sweater. Read baby books or watch baby programs on your computer or TV. Do things to keep your mind busy.  - Accept help. When friends and loved ones ask what they can do, put them to work mowing the lawn, cleaning the bathroom, or keeping you company.  - Seek support. Connect with other moms who know what you are going through. Talk to friends who have been in your shoes. Check for support groups, bulletin boards, and chat rooms online for moms-to-be who are also on bed rest.  - Expect emotional ups and downs. Share your hopes and worries with your partner. Let each other vent if needed. If sexis notallowed, look for other ways to show your love. Take time to kiss, hug, and cuddle.)

ADAM_0001722_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Getting out of bed after surgery
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000174.htm
Answer: Summary : It is normal to feel a little weak after surgery. Getting out of bed after surgery is not always easy, but spending time out of bed will help you heal faster.  Try to get out of bed at least 2 to 3 times a day to sit in a chair or take a short walk when your nurse says it is ok.  Your doctor may have a physical therapist or assistant teach you how to get out of bed safely.  Make sure you are taking the right amount of pain medications at the right time to reduce your pain. Tell your nurse if getting out of bed causes a lot of pain.

Steps to Take : Make sure someone is with you for safety and support in the beginning.  To get out of bed:  - Roll onto your side.  - Bend your knees until your legs are hanging over the side of the bed.  - Use your arms to lift your upper body up so that you are sitting on the edge of the bed.  - Push off with your arms to stand up.    Stay still for a moment to make sure you are steady. Focus on an object in the room that you can walk to. If you feel dizzy, sit back down.  If you have an intravenous (IV) line, use the pole for support while you take small steps.  To get back into bed:  - Sit on the edge of the bed.  - Gently swing your legs back onto the bed.  - Use your arms for support as you lie down on your side  - Roll onto your back.

Movements in Bed : You can also move around in bed. Change your position at least every 2 hours. Shift from your back to your side. Alternate sides each time you shift.  Try ankle pump exercises in bed every 2 hours by bending your ankles up and down for a few minutes.  If you were taught coughing and deep breathing exercises, practice them for 10 to 15 minutes every 2 hours. Place your hands on your stomach, then your ribs, and breathe deeply, feeling the stomach wall and rib cage move.  Put on your compression stockings in bed if your nurse asks you to. This will help with your circulation and recovery.

When to Call the Nurse : Use the call button to call your nurse if you have trouble (pain, dizziness, or weakness) getting out of bed.)

ADAM_0001753_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Going home after a C-section
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000624.htm
Answer: Summary : You are going home after a C-section. You should expect to need help caring for yourself and your newborn. Talk to your partner, parents, in-laws, or friends.

What to Expect : You may have bleeding from your vagina for up to 6 weeks. It will slowly become less red, then pink, and then will have more of a yellow or white color. Bleeding and discharge after delivery is called lochia.  At first, your incision will be raised slightly and pinker than the rest of your skin. It will likely appear somewhat puffy.  - Any pain should decrease after 2 or 3 days, but your incision will remain tender for up to 3 weeks or more.  - Most women need pain medicine for the first few days to 2 weeks.  - Over time, your scar will become thinner and flatter and will turn either white or the color of your skin.    You will need a follow-up appointment with your health care provider in 4 to 6 weeks.

Incision Care : If you go home with a dressing (bandage), change the dressing over your incision once a day, or sooner if it gets dirty or wet.  - Your provider will tell you when to stop keeping your wound covered.  - Keep the wound area clean by washing it with mild soap and water. You don't need to scrub it. Often, just letting the water run over your wound in the shower is enough.  - You may remove your wound dressing and take showers if stitches, staples, or glue were used to close your skin.  - DO NOT soak in a bathtub or hot tub, or go swimming, until your provider tells you it is ok, usually not until 3 weeks after surgery.    If strips (Steri-Strips) were used to close your incision:  - DO NOT try to wash off the Steri-Strips or glue. It is ok to shower and pat your incision dry with a clean towel.  - They should fall off in about a week. If they are still there after 10 days, you can remove them, unless your provider tells you not to.

Activity : Getting up and walking around once you are home will help you heal faster and can help prevent blood clots.  You should be able to do most of your regular activities in 4 to 8 weeks. Before then:  - DO NOT lift anything heavier than your baby for the first 6 to 8 weeks.  - Short walks are okay. Light housework is ok. Slowly increase how much you do.  - Avoid heavy housecleaning, jogging, most exercises, and any activities that make you breathe hard or strain your muscles. DO NOT do sit-ups.    DO NOT drive a car for at least 2 weeks. It is ok to ride in a car, but make sure you wear your seat belt. DO NOT drive if you are taking narcotic pain medicine or if you feel weak or unsafe driving.

Other Self-care : Try eating smaller meals than normal and have healthy snacks in between. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and drink 8 cups of water a day to keep from getting constipated.  Any hemorrhoids you develop should slowly decrease in size. Some may go away. Methods that may help the symptoms include:  - Warm tub baths (shallow enough to keep your incision above the water level)  - Cold compresses over the area  - Over-the-counter pain relievers  - Over-the-counter hemorrhoid ointments or suppositories    Sex can begin any time after 6 weeks. Also, be sure to talk with your provider about contraception after pregnancy.  After C-sections that follow a difficult labor, some moms feel relieved. But others feel sad, disappointed, or even guilty about needing a C-section.  - Many of these feelings are normal, even for women who had a vaginal birth.  - Try talking with your partner, family, or friends about your feelings.  - Seek help from your health care provider if these feelings do not go away or become worse.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Call your health care provider if you have vaginal bleeding that:  - Is still very heavy (like your menstrual period flow) after more than 4 days  - Is light but lasts beyond 4 weeks  - Involves the passing of large clots  - Occurs 7 to 14 days after delivery from a scab forming at the site where the placenta is shed    Also call your provider if you have:  - Swelling in one of your legs (it will be red and warmer than the other leg)  - Pain in your calf  - Redness, warmth, swelling, or drainage from your incision site, or your incision breaks open  - Fever  - Increased pain in your belly  - Discharge from your vagina that becomes heavier or develops a foul odor  - Become very sad, depressed, or withdrawn, are having feelings of harming yourself or your baby, or are having trouble caring for yourself or your baby  - A tender, reddened, or warm area on one breast (this may be a sign of infection))

ADAM_0003154_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Polysomnography (Also called: Sleep study; Polysomnogram; Rapid eye movement studies; Split night polysomnography; PSG)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003932.htm
Answer: Summary : Polysomnography is a sleep study. This test records certain body functions as you as you sleep, or try to sleep. Polysomnography is used to diagnose sleep disorders.

How the Test is Performed : There are two states of sleep:  - Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.Most dreaming occurs during REM sleep. Under normal circumstances, your muscles, except for your eyes and breathing muscles, do not move during this stage of sleep.  - Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. NREM has three stages that can be detected by brain waves (EEG).   REM sleep alternates with NREM sleep about every 90 minutes. A person with normal sleep usually has four to five cycles of REM and NREM sleep during a night.  A sleep study measures your sleep cycles and stages by recording:  - Air flow in and out of your lungs as you breathe  - The level of oxygen in your blood  - Body position  - Brain waves (EEG)  - Breathing effort and rate  - Electrical activity of muscles  - Eye movement  - Heart rate   Polysomnography can be done either at a sleep center or in your home.  AT A SLEEP CENTER  Full sleep studies are usually done at a special sleep center.  - You will be asked to arrive about 2 hours before bedtime.  - You will sleep in a bed at the center. Many sleep centers have comfortable bedrooms, similar to a hotel.  - The test isusually done at night so that your normal sleep patterns can be studied. If you are a night shift worker, many centers can perform the test during your normal sleep hours.  - Your health care provider will place electrodes on your chin, scalp, and the outer edge of your eyelids. You will have monitors to record your heart rate and breathing attached to your chest. These will remain in place while you sleep.  - The electrodes record signals while you are awake (with your eyes closed) and during sleep. The test measures the amount of time it takes you to fall asleep and how long it takes you to enter REM sleep.  - A specially-trained health care provider will observe you while you sleep and note any changes in your breathing or heart rate.  - The test will record the number of times that you either stop breathing or almost stop breathing.  - There are also monitors to record your movements during sleep. Sometimes a video camera records your movements during sleep.   AT HOME  You may be able to use a sleep study device in your home instead of at a sleep center to help diagnose sleep apnea. You either pick up the device at a sleep center or a trained therapist comes to your home to set it up.  Home testing may be used when:  - You are under the care of a sleep specialist  - Your sleep doctor thinks you have obstructive sleep apnea  - You do not have other sleep disorders  - You do not have other serious health problems, such as heart disease or lung disease

How to Prepare for the Test : Whether the test is at a sleep study center or at home, you prepare the same way. Unless directed to do so by your doctor, do not take any sleep medicine and do not drink alcohol or caffeinated beverages before the test. They can interfere with your sleep.

Why the Test is Performed : The testhelps diagnose possible sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).Your health care provider may think you have OSA because you havethese symptoms:  - Daytime sleepiness (falling asleep during the day)  - Loud snoring  - Periods ofholding your breath while you sleep, followed by gasps or snorts  - Restless sleep   Polysomnographycan alsodiagnose other sleep disorders:  - Narcolepsy  - Periodic limb movements disorder (movingyour legs often during sleep)  - REM behavior disorder (physically ""acting out""your dreams during sleep)

Normal Results : A sleep study tracks:  - How often you stop breathing for at least 10 seconds (called apnea)  - How often your breathing is partly blocked for 10 seconds (called hypopnea)  - Your brain waves and muscle movements during sleep   Most people have short periods during sleep where their breathing stops or is partly blocked. The Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) is the number of apnea or hypopnea measured during a sleep study.AHI results are used to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea.  Normal test result show:  - Few or no episodes of stopping breathing.An AHI of less than 5 is considered normal.  - Normal patterns of brain waves and muscle movements during sleep.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Test results above 5 may mean you have sleep apnea:  - 5 - 15 is mild sleep apnea  - 15 - 30 is moderate sleep apnea  - More than 30 is severe sleep apnea   To make a diagnosis and decide on treatment, the sleep specialist must also look at:  - Other findings from the sleep study  - Your medical history and sleep-related complaints  - Your physical exam)

ADAM_0003285_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Pulling a patient up in bed (Also called: Moving a patient in bed)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000429.htm
Answer: Summary : A patient's body may slowly slide when the person is in bed for a long time. The person may ask to be moved up higher for comfort or may need to be moved up so a health care provider can do an exam.

Avoiding injury : You must move or pull someone up in bed the right way to avoid injuring the patient's shoulders and skin. Using the right method will also help protect your back.  It takes at least two people to safely move a patient up in bed.  Friction from rubbing can scrape or tear the person's skin. Common areas at risk for friction are the shoulders, back, buttocks, elbows, and heels.   Never move patients up by grabbing them under their arms and pulling. This can injure their shoulders.

Preparing to move the patient : A slide sheet is the best way to prevent friction. If you do not have one, you can make a draw sheet out of a bed sheet folded in half. Follow these steps to prepare the patient:  - Tell the patient what you are doing.  - Make the bed flat.  - Roll the patient to one side, then place a half rolled-up slide sheet or draw sheet against the person's back.  - Roll the patient onto the sheet and spread the sheet out flat under the person.  - Make sure the head, shoulders, and hips are on the sheet.

Pulling up : The goal is to pull, not lift, the patient toward the head of the bed. The two people moving the patient should stand on opposite sides of the bed. To pull the person up both people should:   - Grab the slide sheet or draw sheet on the side of the bed closest to you.  - Put one foot forward as you prepare to move the patient.  - On the count of three, move the patient by pulling the sheet toward the head of the bed. You may need to do this more than once to get the person in the right position.    If using a slide sheet, remove it when you're done.  If the patient can help you, ask the patient to:  - Bring the chin up to the chest and bend the knees. The patient's heels should remain on the bed.  - Have the patient push with the heels while you pull up.)

ADAM_0003899_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about The night before your surgery
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000371.htm
Answer: Summary : You've spent weeks going to appointments, preparing your home, and getting healthy. Now it's time for surgery. You may feel relieved or nervous at this point.  Taking care of a few last-minute details can help make your surgery successful. Depending on the type of surgery you're having, follow any further advice from your doctor or nurse.

Medications : Two weeks before surgery, you may have been told to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. Among other drugs, this includes:  - Aspirin  - Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)  - Naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve)    Take only the medicines your doctor has told you to take before surgery, including prescription medicines. If you're confused about which medicines to take the night before or the day of surgery, call your doctor.  Do not take any supplements, herbs, vitamins, or minerals before surgery unless your doctor said it is OK.  Bring a list of all your medicines to the hospital. Include the ones that you were told to stop taking before surgery. Make sure you write down the dose and how often you take them. If possible, bring your medicines in their containers.

Washing your skin : You may take a shower or bath both the night before and the morning of surgery.  Your doctor or nurse may have given you a medicated soap to use. Read the instructions for how to use this soap. If you were not given medicated soap, use antibacterial soap that you can buy at the store.  Do not shave the area that will be operated on. The doctors or nurses will do that at the hospital, if needed.  Scrub your fingernails with a brush. Remove nail polish and makeup before you go to the hospital.

Eating and drinking before surgery : It is likely that you have been asked not to eat or drink after midnight. This usually means both solid foods and liquids.  You may brush your teeth and rinse your mouth in the morning. If you were told to take any medicine on the morning of surgery, you may take them with a sip of water.

Symptoms to report : If you do not feel well in the days before or on the day of surgery, call your surgeon's office. The symptoms your surgeon needs to know about include:  - Any new skin rashes or skin infections (including herpes outbreak)  - Chest pain or shortness of breath  - Cough  - Fever  - Cold or flu symptoms

What you should pack : Clothing items:  - Flat walking shoes with rubber or crepe on the bottom  - Shorts or sweatpants  - T-shirt  - Lightweight bath robe  - Clothes to wear when you go home (sweat suit or something easy to put on and take off)    Personal care items:  - Eyeglasses (instead of contact lenses)  - Toothbrush, toothpaste, and deodorant  - Razor (electric only)    Other items:  - Crutches, can, or walker  - Books or magazines  - Important telephone numbers of friends and relatives  - Small amount of money)

ADAM_0004060_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Turning patients over in bed (Also called: Roll patients in bed)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000426.htm
Answer: Summary : Changing a patient's position in bed every 2 hours helps keep blood flowing. This helps the skin stay healthy and prevents bedsores.  Turning a patient is a good time to check the skin for redness and sores.

Getting a patient ready : - Explain to the patient what you are planning to do so the person knows what to expect. Encourage the person to help you if possible.  - Stand on the side of the bed the patient will be turning towards and lower the bed rail.  - Ask the patient to look towards you. This will be the direction in which the person is turning.  - Move the patient to the center of the bed so the person is not at risk of rolling out of the bed. Make sure the rail is up on the side you are turning the person toward.  - The patient's bottom arm should be stretched towards you. Place the person's top arm across the chest.  - Cross the patient's upper ankle over the bottom ankle.    If you are turning the patient onto the stomach, make sure the person's bottom hand is above the head first.

Turning a patient : - If you can, raise the bed to a level that reduces back strain for you. Make the bed flat.  - Get as close to the person as you can.  - Place one of your hands on the patient's shoulder and your other hand on the hip.  - Standing with one foot ahead of the other, shift your weight to your front foot as you gently pull the patient's shoulder toward you. Then shift your weight to your back foot as you gently pull the person's hip toward you.    You may need to repeat steps 3 and 4 until the patient is in the right position.

When the patient is in the right position : - Make sure the patient's ankles, knees, and elbows are not resting on top of each other.  - Make sure the head and neck are in line with the spine, not stretched forward, back, or to the side.  - Return the bed to a comfortable position with the side rails up. Check with the patient to make sure the patient is comfortable. Use pillows as needed.)

MPlusHealthTopics_0000823_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Sleep Apnea ? (Also called: Sleep-disordered breathing)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/sleepapnea.html
Answer: Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes your breathing to stop or get very shallow. Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour.    The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during sleep. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea.    You are more at risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight, male, or have a family history or small airways. Children with enlarged tonsils may also get it.    Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and sleep study results.    When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes, work-related accidents, and other medical problems. If you have it, it is important to get treatment. Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can treat sleep apnea in many people.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute)

ADAM_0001324_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Ear wax (Also called: Ear impaction; Cerumen impaction; Ear blockage)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000979.htm
Answer: Summary : The ear canal is lined with hair follicles and glands that produce a waxy oil called cerumen. The wax will most often make its way to the opening of the ear. There it will fall out or be removed by washing.   Wax can build up and block the ear canal. Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss.

Causes : Ear wax protects the ear by:  - Trapping and preventing dust, bacteria, and other germs and smallobjects from entering and damaging the ear   - Protecting the delicate skin of the ear canal from getting irritated when water is in the canal   In some people, the glands produce more wax than can be easily removed from the ear. This extra wax may harden in the ear canal and block the ear. When you try to clean the ear, you may instead push wax deeperand blockthe ear canal.

Symptoms : - Earache  - Fullness in the ear or a sensation that the ear is plugged  - Noises in the ear (tinnitus)  - Partial hearing loss, may get worse

Treatment : Most cases of ear wax blockage can be treated at home. The following remedies can be used to soften wax in the ear:  -  Baby oil   -  Commercial drops   -  Glycerin   -  Mineral oil   -  Water    Another method is to wash out the wax.   - Use body-temperature water (cooler or warmer water may cause brief but severe dizziness or vertigo).  - Hold your head upright andstraighten the ear canal by holding the outside ear and gently pulling upward.  - Use a syringe (you can buy one at the store) to gently direct a small stream of water against the ear canal wall next to the wax plug.  - Tip your head to allow the water to drain. You may need to repeat irrigation several times.    To avoid damaging your ear or causing an infection:  - Never irrigate the ear if the eardrum may have a hole in it.  - Do not irrigate the ear with a jet irrigator designed for cleaning teeth (such as a WaterPik).    After the wax is removed, dry the ear thoroughly. You may use a few drops of alcohol in the ear or a hair dryer set on low to help dry the ear.  You may clean the outer ear canal by using a cloth or paper tissue wrapped around your finger. Mineral oil can be used to moisturize the ear and prevent the wax from drying.  - Do not clean your ears too often or too hard. Ear wax also helps protect your ears.  - Never try to clean the ear by putting any object, such as a cotton swab, into the ear canal.    If you cannot remove the wax plug or you have discomfort, consult a health care provider, who may remove the wax by:  - Repeating the irrigation attempts  -  Suctioning the ear canal   -  Using a small device called a curette   -  Using a microscope to help

Outlook (Prognosis) : The ear may become blocked with wax again in the future. Hearing loss is often temporary. In most cases, hearing returns completely after the blockage is removed.  Rarely, trying to remove ear wax may cause an infection in the ear canal or damage to the eardrum.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : See your health care provider if your ears are blocked with wax and you are unable to remove the wax.  Also call if you have an ear wax blockage and you develop new symptoms, such as:  - Drainage from the ear  - Ear pain  - Fever  - Hearing loss that continues afteryou cleanthe wax)

ADAM_0001988_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about His bundle electrography (Also called: His bundle electrogram; HBE; His bundle recording; Electrogram - His bundle)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003391.htm
Answer: Summary : His bundle electrography is a test that measures electrical activity in a part of the heart that carries the signals that control the time between heartbeats (contractions).

How the Test is Performed : The bundle of His is a group of fibers that carry electrical impulses through the center of the heart. If these signals are blocked, you will have problems with your heartbeat.      Watch this video about:   Cardiac conduction system     The His bundle electrography is part of an electrophysiology (EP) study. An intravenous catheter (IV line) is inserted into your arm so that you can be given medicines during the test.  Electrocardiogram (ECG) leads are placed on your arms and legs. Your arm, neck, or groin will be cleaned and numbed with a local anesthetic. After the area is numb, the cardiologist makes a small cut in a vein and inserts a thin tube called a catheter inside.  The catheter is carefully moved through the vein up into the heart. An x-ray method called fluoroscopy helps guide the doctor to the right place. During the test, you are watched for any abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias). The catheter has a sensor on the end, which is used to measure the electrical activity of the bundle of His.

How to Prepare for the Test : You will be told not to eat or drink anything for 6 - 8 hours before the test. The test will be done in a hospital. Some people may need to check into the hospital the night before the test. Otherwise, you will check in the morning of the test. Although the test may take some time, most people do not need to stay in the hospital overnight.  Your health care provider will explain the procedure and its risks. You must sign a consent form before the test starts.  About half an hour before the procedure, you will be given a mild sedative to help you relax. You will wear a hospital gown. The procedure may last from 1 to several hours.

How the Test will Feel : You are awake during the test. You may feel some discomfort when the IV is placed into your arm, and some pressure at the site when the catheter is inserted.

Why the Test is Performed : This test may be done to:  - Determine if you need a pacemaker or other treatment  - Diagnose arrhythmias  - Find the specific location where electrical signals through the heart are blocked

Normal Results : The time between electrical signals from the bundle of His are evenly spaced.

What Abnormal Results Mean : A pacemaker will be needed if the test results are abnormal.  Abnormal results may mean you have or had:  - Chronic conduction system disease  - Carotid sinus pressure  - Recent heart attack  - Atrial disease

Risks : Risks of the procedure include:  - Arrhythmias  - Cardiac tamponade  - Embolism from blood clots at the tip of the catheter   - Heart attack  - Hemorrhage  - Infection  - Injury to the vein or artery  - Low blood pressure  - Stroke)

GHR_0000828_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) progressive familial heart block ? (Also called: bundle branch block; HBBD; hereditary bundle branch defect; hereditary bundle branch system defect; Lenegre Lev disease; Lev-Lengre disease; Lev syndrome; Lev's disease; PCCD; progressive cardiac conduction defect)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/progressive-familial-heart-block
Answer: Progressive familial heart block is a genetic condition that alters the normal beating of the heart. A normal heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way. These signals begin in a specialized cluster of cells called the sinoatrial node (the heart's natural pacemaker) located in the heart's upper chambers (the atria). From there, a group of cells called the atrioventricular node carries the electrical signals to another cluster of cells called the bundle of His. This bundle separates into multiple thin spindles called bundle branches, which carry electrical signals into the heart's lower chambers (the ventricles). Electrical impulses move from the sinoatrial node down to the bundle branches, stimulating a normal heartbeat in which the ventricles contract slightly later than the atria.  Heart block occurs when the electrical signaling is obstructed anywhere from the atria to the ventricles. In people with progressive familial heart block, the condition worsens over time: early in the disorder, the electrical signals are partially blocked, but the block eventually becomes complete, preventing any signals from passing through the heart. Partial heart block causes a slow or irregular heartbeat (bradycardia or arrhythmia, respectively), and can lead to the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the cells that carry electrical impulses. Fibrosis contributes to the development of complete heart block, resulting in uncoordinated electrical signaling between the atria and the ventricles and inefficient pumping of blood in the heart. Complete heart block can cause a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), shortness of breath, fainting (syncope), or sudden cardiac arrest and death.  Progressive familial heart block can be divided into type I and type II, with type I being further divided into types IA and IB. These types differ in where in the heart signaling is interrupted and the genetic cause. In types IA and IB, the heart block originates in the bundle branch, and in type II, the heart block originates in the atrioventricular node. The different types of progressive familial heart block have similar signs and symptoms.  Most cases of heart block are not genetic and are not considered progressive familial heart block. The most common cause of heart block is fibrosis of the heart, which occurs as a normal process of aging.

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/progressive-familial-heart-block
Answer: Mutations in the SCN5A and TRPM4 genes cause most cases of progressive familial heart block types IA and IB, respectively. The proteins produced from these genes are channels that allow positively charged atoms (cations) into and out of cells. Both channels are abundant in heart (cardiac) cells and play key roles in these cells' ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. These channels play a major role in signaling the start of each heartbeat, coordinating the contractions of the atria and ventricles, and maintaining a normal heart rhythm.  The SCN5A and TRPM4 gene mutations that cause progressive familial heart block alter the normal function of the channels. As a result of these channel alterations, cardiac cells have difficulty producing and transmitting the electrical signals that are necessary to coordinate normal heartbeats, leading to heart block. Death of these impaired cardiac cells over time can lead to fibrosis, worsening the heart block.  Mutations in other genes, some of which are unknown, account for the remaining cases of progressive familial heart block.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/progressive-familial-heart-block
Answer: Progressive familial heart block types I and II are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Some people with TRPM4 gene mutations never develop the condition, a situation known as reduced penetrance.  In most cases, an affected person has one parent with progressive familial heart block.)

Answer: The treatment for heart block depends the type of heart block you have and the cause.  If you do not have serious symptoms and have a milder type of heart block, you will most likely need to:  - Have regular checkups with your health care provider.  - Check your pulse every day.  - Be aware of your symptoms and know when to call your provider if symptoms change.   If you have second- or third-degree heart block, you may need a pacemaker to help your heart beat regularly.  - A pacemaker is smaller than a deck of cards. It is put inside the skin on your chest. It gives off electrical signals to make your heart beat at a regular rate and rhythm.  - How long you need the pacemaker depends on the type of heart block you have.  - Heart block caused by a heart attack or heart surgery may go away as you recover.  - If medicine is causing heart block, changing medications can fix the problem. Do NOT stop taking any medicine unless your doctor tells you to do so.)

ADAM_0001988_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about His bundle electrography (Also called: His bundle electrogram; HBE; His bundle recording; Electrogram - His bundle)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003391.htm
Answer: Summary : His bundle electrography is a test that measures electrical activity in a part of the heart that carries the signals that control the time between heartbeats (contractions).

How the Test is Performed : The bundle of His is a group of fibers that carry electrical impulses through the center of the heart. If these signals are blocked, you will have problems with your heartbeat.      Watch this video about:   Cardiac conduction system     The His bundle electrography is part of an electrophysiology (EP) study. An intravenous catheter (IV line) is inserted into your arm so that you can be given medicines during the test.  Electrocardiogram (ECG) leads are placed on your arms and legs. Your arm, neck, or groin will be cleaned and numbed with a local anesthetic. After the area is numb, the cardiologist makes a small cut in a vein and inserts a thin tube called a catheter inside.  The catheter is carefully moved through the vein up into the heart. An x-ray method called fluoroscopy helps guide the doctor to the right place. During the test, you are watched for any abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias). The catheter has a sensor on the end, which is used to measure the electrical activity of the bundle of His.

How to Prepare for the Test : You will be told not to eat or drink anything for 6 - 8 hours before the test. The test will be done in a hospital. Some people may need to check into the hospital the night before the test. Otherwise, you will check in the morning of the test. Although the test may take some time, most people do not need to stay in the hospital overnight.  Your health care provider will explain the procedure and its risks. You must sign a consent form before the test starts.  About half an hour before the procedure, you will be given a mild sedative to help you relax. You will wear a hospital gown. The procedure may last from 1 to several hours.

How the Test will Feel : You are awake during the test. You may feel some discomfort when the IV is placed into your arm, and some pressure at the site when the catheter is inserted.

Why the Test is Performed : This test may be done to:  - Determine if you need a pacemaker or other treatment  - Diagnose arrhythmias  - Find the specific location where electrical signals through the heart are blocked

Normal Results : The time between electrical signals from the bundle of His are evenly spaced.

What Abnormal Results Mean : A pacemaker will be needed if the test results are abnormal.  Abnormal results may mean you have or had:  - Chronic conduction system disease  - Carotid sinus pressure  - Recent heart attack  - Atrial disease

Risks : Risks of the procedure include:  - Arrhythmias  - Cardiac tamponade  - Embolism from blood clots at the tip of the catheter   - Heart attack  - Hemorrhage  - Infection  - Injury to the vein or artery  - Low blood pressure  - Stroke)

(Also called: bundle branch block; HBBD; hereditary bundle branch defect; hereditary bundle branch system defect; Lenegre Lev disease; Lev-Lengre disease; Lev syndrome; Lev's disease; PCCD; progressive cardiac conduction defect)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/progressive-familial-heart-block
Answer: Progressive familial heart block is a genetic condition that alters the normal beating of the heart. A normal heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way. These signals begin in a specialized cluster of cells called the sinoatrial node (the heart's natural pacemaker) located in the heart's upper chambers (the atria). From there, a group of cells called the atrioventricular node carries the electrical signals to another cluster of cells called the bundle of His. This bundle separates into multiple thin spindles called bundle branches, which carry electrical signals into the heart's lower chambers (the ventricles). Electrical impulses move from the sinoatrial node down to the bundle branches, stimulating a normal heartbeat in which the ventricles contract slightly later than the atria.  Heart block occurs when the electrical signaling is obstructed anywhere from the atria to the ventricles. In people with progressive familial heart block, the condition worsens over time: early in the disorder, the electrical signals are partially blocked, but the block eventually becomes complete, preventing any signals from passing through the heart. Partial heart block causes a slow or irregular heartbeat (bradycardia or arrhythmia, respectively), and can lead to the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the cells that carry electrical impulses. Fibrosis contributes to the development of complete heart block, resulting in uncoordinated electrical signaling between the atria and the ventricles and inefficient pumping of blood in the heart. Complete heart block can cause a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations), shortness of breath, fainting (syncope), or sudden cardiac arrest and death.  Progressive familial heart block can be divided into type I and type II, with type I being further divided into types IA and IB. These types differ in where in the heart signaling is interrupted and the genetic cause. In types IA and IB, the heart block originates in the bundle branch, and in type II, the heart block originates in the atrioventricular node. The different types of progressive familial heart block have similar signs and symptoms.  Most cases of heart block are not genetic and are not considered progressive familial heart block. The most common cause of heart block is fibrosis of the heart, which occurs as a normal process of aging. Other causes of heart block can include the use of certain medications or an infection of the heart tissue.)

ADAM_0000140_Sec2.txt,"Question: What is (are) Alcohol use and safe drinking ? (Also called: Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001944.htm
Answer: Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.  TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50 -- coma  - 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death    You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.  HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL  Alcohol increases the risk of:  - Alcoholism  - Falls, drownings, and other accidents  - Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers  - Motor vehicle accidents  - Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  - Suicide and homicide    Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.  RESPONSIBLE DRINKING  If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.  Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:  - Never drink alcohol and drive a car.  - If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.  - Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.    If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.  If alcohol use runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.  CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:  - You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member  - You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use or support groups  - You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking    Other resources include:  - Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups  - Local hospitals  - Public or private mental health agencies  - School or work counselors  - Student or employee health centers)

ADAM_0000154_Sec2.txt,"Question: What to do for Allergic reactions ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000005.htm
Answer: Allergic reactions are common. The immune response that causes an allergic reaction is similar to the response that causes hay fever. Most reactions happen soon after contact with an allergen.  Many allergic reactions are mild, while others can be severe and life-threatening. They can be confined to a small area of the body, or they may affect the entire body. The most severe form is called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock. Allergic reactions occur more often in people who have a family history of allergies.  Substances that don't bother most people (such as venom from bee stings and certain foods, medications, and pollens) can trigger allergic reactions in certain people.  First-time exposure may produce only a mild reaction. Repeated exposures may lead to more serious reactions. Once a person has had an exposure or an allergic reaction (is sensitized), even a very limited exposure to a very small amount of allergen can trigger a severe reaction.  Most severe allergic reactions occur within seconds or minutes after exposure to the allergen. Some reactions can occur after several hours, particularly if the allergen causes a reaction after it has been eaten. In very rare cases, reactions develop after 24 hours.  Anaphylaxis is a sudden and severe allergic reaction that occurs within minutes of exposure. Immediate medical attention is needed for this condition. Without treatment, anaphylaxis can get worse very quickly and lead to death within 15 minutes.)

ADAM_0000179_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Am I in labor? (Also called: False labor; Braxton Hicks contractions; Prodromal labor; Latent labor; Pregnancy - labor)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000508.htm
Answer: Summary : If you've never given birth before, you may think you'll just know when the time comes. In reality, it isn't always easy to know when you're going into labor. The steps leading up to labor can drag on for days.  Keep in mind that your due date is just a general idea of when your labor may start. Normal term labor can start any time between 3 weeks before and 2 weeks after this date.

False labor (Braxton Hicks contractions) : Most pregnant women feel mild contractions before true labor begins. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions, which:  - Are typically short  - Are not painful  - Do not come at regular intervals  - Are not accompanied by bleeding, leaking fluid, or decreased fetal movement    This stage is called ""prodromal"" or ""latent"" labor.

Other signs that labor is near : Lightening: This happens when your baby's head ""drops"" down into your pelvis.   - Your belly will look lower. It will be easier for you to breathe because the baby is not putting pressure on your lungs.  - You may need to urinate more often because the baby is pressing on your bladder.  - For first-time mothers, lightening often happens a few weeks before birth. For women who have had babies before, it may not happen until labor has begun.    Bloody show: If you have bloody or brownish discharge from your vagina, it may mean your cervix has begun to dilate. The mucous plug that sealed your cervix for the last 9 months may be visible. This is a good sign. But active labor may still be days away.   Your baby moves less: If you feel less movement, call your doctor or midwife, as sometimes decreased movement can mean that the baby is in trouble.   Your water breaks: When the amniotic sac (bag of fluid around the baby) breaks, you will feel fluid leak from your vagina. It may come out in a trickle or a gush.   - For most women, contractions come within 24 hours after the bag of water breaks.  - Even if contractions don't begin, let your doctor or midwife know as soon as you think your water has broken.    Diarrhea: Some women have the urge to go to the bathroom often to empty their bowels. If this happens and your stools are looser than normal, you may be going into labor.   Nesting: There's no science behind the theory, but plenty of women feel the sudden urge to ""nest"" right before labor starts. If you feel the need to vacuum the entire house at 3 a.m., or finish your work in the baby's nursery, you may be getting ready for labor.

True labor : In real labor, your contractions will:   - Come regularly and get closer together  - Last from 30 to 70 seconds, and will get longer  - Not stop, no matter what you do  - Radiate (reach) into your lower back and upper belly  - Get stronger or become more intense as time goes on  - Make you unable to talk to other people or laugh at a joke

When to call the doctor or midwife : Call your doctor or midwife right away if you have:   - Leaking amniotic fluid  - Decreased fetal movement  - Any vaginal bleeding other than light spotting  - Regular, painful contractions every 5 to 10 minutes for 60 minutes   Call for any other reason if you are unsure what to do.)

Answer: The main cause of bleeding gum is the buildup of plaque at the gum line. This will lead to a condition called gingivitis, or inflamed gums.  Plaque that is not removed will harden into tartar. This will lead to increased bleeding and a more advanced form of gum and jawbone disease known as periodontitis.  Other causes of bleeding gums include:  - Any bleeding disorder  - Brushing too hard  - Hormonal changes during pregnancy  - Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura  - Ill-fitting dentures or other dental appliances  - Improper flossing  - Infection, which can be either tooth- or gum-related  - Leukemia  - Scurvy  - Use of blood thinners  - Vitamin K deficiency)

ADAM_0000475_Sec3.txt,"Question: What to do for Bleeding gums ? (Also called: Gums - bleeding)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003062.htm
Answer: Visit the dentist at least once every 6 months for plaque removal. Follow your dentist's home care instructions.  You should brush your teeth gently with a soft-bristle toothbrush at least twice a day. It is best if you can brush after every meal. Your dentist may tell you to rinse with salt water or hydrogen peroxide and water. Do not use mouthwashes that contain alcohol, which can make the problem worse.   Flossing teeth twice a day can prevent plaque from building up. It can help to follow a balanced, healthy diet. Try to avoid snacking between meals and cut down on the carbohydrates you eat.   Other tips:  - Have periodontal exam.  - Avoid the use of tobacco, which aggravates bleeding gums.  - Control gum bleeding by applying pressure directly on the gums with a gauze pad soaked in ice water.  - If you have been diagnosed with a vitamin deficiency, take vitamin supplements.  - Avoid aspirin unless your health care provider has recommended that you take it.  - If side effects of a medicine are causing the irritation, ask your doctor to prescribe a different drug. Never change your medicine without first talking to your doctor.  - Use an oral irrigation device on the low setting to massage the gums.  - See your dentist if your dentures or other dental appliances do not fit well or are causing sore spots on your gums.  - Follow your dentist's instructions on how to brush and floss so you can avoid hurting your gums.)

ADAM_0001279_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Drinking water safely during cancer treatment
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000060.htm
Answer: Summary : During and right after your cancer treatment, your body cannot protect itself against infections. Tiny germs can be in water, even when it looks clean. You need to be careful where you get your water from. This includes water for drinking, cooking, and brushing your teeth. Ask your doctor or nurse about special care you should take.

Tap water : Tap water is water from your faucet. It should be safe when it comes from:  - A city water supply  - A city well that supplies many people with water    If you live in a small city or town, check with your local water department. Ask if they test the water every day for the kind of germs that can give you an infection -- germs are called coliforms.

Well water : Boil water from a private well or a small community well before you drink it or use it for cooking or brushing your teeth.  Running well water through a filter or adding chlorine to it does not make it safe to use. Test your well water at least once a year for coliform germs that may cause an infection. Test your water more often if coliforms are found in it or if there is any question about the safety of your water.  To boil water and store it:  - Heat the water to a rolling boil.  - Keep the water boiling for at least 1 minute.  - After boiling the water, store it in the refrigerator in a clean and covered container.  - Use all this water within 3 days (72 hours). If you do not use it in this time, pour it down the drain or use it to water your plants or your garden.

Bottled water : The label on any bottled water you drink should say how it was cleaned. Look for these words:  - Reverse osmosis filtration  - Distillation or distilled

Water filters : Tap water should be safe when it comes from a city water supply or a city well that supplies many people with water. It does not need to be filtered.  You should boil water that comes from a private well or a small local well, even if you have a filter.  Many sink filters, filters in refrigerators, pitchers that use filters, and some filters for camping do not remove germs.  If you have a home water-filtering system (such as a filter under your sink), change the filter as often as the manufacturer recommends.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003852.htm
Answer: Summary : A gum biopsy is a surgery in which a small piece of gingival (gum) tissue is removed and examined.

How the Test is Performed : A painkiller is sprayed into the mouth in the area of the abnormal gum tissue. You may also have an injection of numbing medicine. A small piece of gum tissue is removed and checked for problems in the lab. Sometimes stitches are used to close the opening created for the biopsy.

How to Prepare for the Test : You may be told not to eat for a few hours before the biopsy.

How the Test will Feel : The painkiller put in your mouth should numb the area during the procedure. You may feel some tugging or pressure. If there is bleeding, the blood vessels may be sealed off with an electric current or laser. This is called electrocauterization. After the numbness wears off, the area may be sore for a few days.

Why the Test is Performed : This test is done to look for the cause of abnormal gum tissue.

Normal Results : This test is only done when gum tissue looks abnormal.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may indicate:  - Amyloid  - Noncancerous mouth sores (the specific cause can be determined in many cases)  - Oral cancer (for example, squamous cell carcinoma)

Risks : Risks for this procedure include:  - Bleeding from the biopsy site  - Infection of the gums  - Soreness

Information : Make a Commitment to Safety  Teens also need to commit to being safe and responsible drivers in order to improve the odds in their favor.  - Reckless driving is still a danger to teens -- even with automobile safety features.  - All new drivers should take a driver's education course. These courses can reduce risk for crashes.    Drivers and passengers should use automobile safety features at all times. These include: seat belts, shoulder straps, and headrests. Only drive cars that have air bags, padded dashes, safety glass, collapsible steering columns, and anti-lock brakes.  Auto accidents are also a leading cause of death in infants and children. Infants and young children should be properly buckled into a child safety seat of the right size that is correctly installed in the vehicle.  Avoid Distracted Driving   Distractions are a problem for all drivers. Do not use cell phones for talking, texting, or email when you are driving.   - Mobile phones should be turned off when driving so you are not tempted to make calls, send or read texts, or answer the phone.  - If phones are left on for emergency use, pull off of the road before answering or texting.    Other tips include:  - Avoid putting on makeup while driving, even when stopped at a light or stop sign, it can be dangerous.  - Finish eating before starting your car and driving.    Driving with friends can lead to accidents.  - Teens are safer driving alone or with family. For the first 6 months, teens should drive with an adult driver who can help them learn good driving habits.  - New drivers should wait at least 3 to 6 months before taking friends as passengers.    Teenage-related driving deaths occur more often in certain conditions.  Other safety tips for teens  - Reckless driving is still a danger, even when using seatbelts. Do not rush. It is safer to be late.  - Avoid driving at nighttime. Your driving skills and reflexes are just developing during the first months of driving. Darkness adds an extra factor to cope with.  - When drowsy, stop driving until fully alert. Sleepiness may cause more accidents than alcohol.  - Never drink and drive. Drinking slows reflexes and hurts judgment. These effects happen to anyone who drinks. So, NEVER drink and drive. ALWAYS find someone to drive who has not been drinking -- even if this means making an uncomfortable phone call.  - Drugs can be just as dangerous as alcohol. Do not mix driving with marijuana, other illegal drugs or any prescribedmedicine that makes you sleepy.   Parents should talk with their teens about ""household driving rules.""  - Make a written ""driving contract"" that both parents and teens sign.  - The contract should include a list of driving rules and what teens can expect if the rules are broken.  - The contract should state that parents have the final say about the driving rules.  - When writing the contract, take into account all of the driving issues that are likely to come up.    Parents can do the following to help prevent teens from drinking and driving:  - Tell their teens to call rather than get in a car with a driver who has been drinking or when they have been drinking. Promise no punishment if they call first.    Some children continue to mix driving and drinking. In many states, the parent must sign for a teenager under 18 to get a driver's license. At any time before the 18th birthday a parent can refuse responsibility and the state will take the license.)

ADAM_0003451_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Safe eating during cancer treatment
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000061.htm
Answer: Summary : When you have cancer, you need good nutrition to help keep your body strong. To do this you need to watch the foods you eat and how you prepare them.  Some raw foods can contain germs that can hurt you when cancer or treatment weakens your immune system. Ask your doctor or nurse about how to eat well but safely.  When you eat eggs:  - Yolks and whites should be cooked solid. Do not eat runny eggs.  - Do not eat foods that may have raw eggs in them (such as Caesar salad dressing, cookie dough, cake batter, and hollandaise sauce).    Be careful when you have dairy products:  - All milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy should have the word pasteurized on their containers.  - Do not eat soft cheeses or cheeses with blue veins (such as Brie, Camembert, Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola, and Bleu).  - Do not eat Mexican-style cheeses (such as queso blanco fresco and cojita).    Fruits and vegetables:  - Wash all raw fruits, vegetables, and fresh herbs with cold running water.  - Do not eat raw vegetable sprouts (such as alfalfa and mung bean).  - Do not use fresh salsa or salad dressings that are kept in the refrigerated cases of the grocery store.  - Drink only juice that says pasteurized on the container.    Do not eat raw honey. Eat only heat-treated honey. Avoid sweets that have creamy fillings.

Cook foods safely : When you cook, make sure you cook your food long enough.  Do not eat uncooked tofu. Cook tofu for at least 5 minutes.  When eating chicken and other poultry:  - Cook whole pieces of poultry to 180 F.  - Cook ground poultry to 165 F.    If you cook beef, lamb, pork, or venison:  - Do not eat raw mean, such as Japanese sashimi.  - Make sure meat is not red or pink before you eat it.  - Cook meat to 160 F.    When eating fish, oysters, and other shellfish:  - Do not eat raw fish (such as sushi), raw oysters, or any other raw shellfish.  - Make sure all fish and shellfish you eat is cooked thoroughly.    Heat all casseroles to 165 F. Warm hot dogs and lunch meats to steaming before you eat them.

Be careful when you eat out : When you dine out, stay away from:  - Raw fruits and vegetables  - Salad bars, buffets, sidewalk vendors, potlucks, and delis    Ask if all fruit juices are pasteurized.  Use only salad dressings, sauces, and salsas from single-serving packages. Eat out at times when restaurants are less crowded. Always ask for your food to be prepared fresh, even at fast food restaurants.)

ADAM_0003452_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Safe sex
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001949.htm
Answer: Summary : Safe sex means taking steps before and during sex that can prevent you from getting an infection, or from giving an infection to your partner.

Information : A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that can be spread to another person through sexual contact. STIs include:  - Chlamydia  - Genital herpes  - Genital warts  - Gonorrhea  - Hepatitis  - HIV  - HPV  - Syphilis    STIs are also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  These infections are spread by direct contact with a sore on the genitals or mouth, body fluids, or sometimes the skin around the genital area.  Before having sex:  - Get to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories  - Don't feel forced into having sex  - Don't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner    Your sexual partner should be someone who you know does not have any STI. Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs and share the test results with each other.  If you know you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know this before you have sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.  Use condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.  - The condom should be in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.  - Keep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with skin areas around the genitals. A condom reduces but does not eliminate your risk of getting an STI.    Other tips include:   - Use lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.  - Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.  - Polyurethane condoms are less likely to break than latex condoms, but they cost more.  - Using condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may increase the chance of HIV transmission.  - Stay sober. Alcohol and drugs impair your judgment. When you are not sober, you might not choose your partner as carefully. You may also forget to use condoms, or use them incorrectly.    Get tested regularly for STIs if you have new sexual partners. Most STIs have no symptoms, so you need to be tested often if there is any chance you have been exposed. You will have the best outcome and will be less likely to spread the infection if you are diagnosed early.  Women should consider getting the HPV vaccine to keep from getting the human papillomavirus. This virus can put you at risk for vaginal warts and cervical cancer.)

ADAM_0003842_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Taking multiple medicines safely
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000883.htm
Answer: Summary : If you take more than one medicine, it is important to take them carefully and safely. Some medicines can interact and cause side effects. It can also be hard to keep track of when and how to take each medicine.  Here are tips to help you keep track of your medicines and take them as directed.

Why you may Need More Than one Medicine : You may take more than one medicine to treat a single condition. Or you may take different medicines to treat more than one health problem. For example, you may take a statin to lower your cholesterol, and a beta-blocker to control your blood pressure.   Older adults often have more than one health condition. So they are more likely to take several medicines.

Risks of Taking Multiple Medicines : The more medicines you take, the more you need to use them carefully. There are several risks when taking multiple medicines.  - You may be more likely to have side effects. Because most medicines can have side effects, the more medicines you take, the more likely you will have side effects. Taking certain medicines can also increase the risk of falls.  - You are at higher risk for drug interactions. An interaction is when one medicine affects how another medicine works. For example, taken together, one medicine may make the other medicine stronger. Medicines can also interact with alcohol and even some foods. Some interactions can be serious, even life threatening.  - You may find it hard to keep track of when to take each medicine. You even may forget which medicine you have taken at a certain time.  - You may take a medicine you do not need. This may be more likely to happen if you see more than one health care provider. You may be prescribed different medicines for the same problem.

People at Higher Risk : Certain people are more likely to have problems from taking multiple medicines:  - People who are prescribed 5 or more medicines. The more medicines you take, the higher the chance of interactions or side effects. You may also find it hard to remember all possible drug interactions.  - People who take medicines prescribed by more than one provider. One provider may not know that you are taking medicines another provider has given you.  - Older adults. As you age, your body processes medicines differently. For instance, your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. This can mean that more medicine stays in your body for longer. This can lead to dangerous levels of medicines in your system.  - People in the hospital. When you are in the hospital, you will likely see new providers who are not familiar with your health history. Without this knowledge, they may prescribe a medicine that may interact with medicines you already take.

What you can do : These suggestions can help you take all of your medicines safely:  - Keep a list of all medicines you take. Your list should include all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. OTC medicines include vitamins, supplements, and herbal products. Keep a copy of the list in your wallet and at home.  - Review your medicine list with your health care providers and pharmacists. Discuss the list with your provider each time you have an appointment. Ask your provider if you still need to take all of the medicines on your list. Also ask if any of the dosages should be changed. Make sure you give all of your providers a copy of your medicine list.  - Ask questions about any new drugs you are prescribed. Make sure you understand how to take them. Also ask if a new medicine could interact with any of the medicines or supplements you are already taking.  - Take your medicines exactly as your provider tells you. If you have questions about how or why to take your medicine, ask your provider. DO NOT skip doses, or stop taking your medicines.  - If you notice side effects, tell your health care provider. DO NOT stop taking your medicines unless your provider tells you to.  - Keep your medicines organized. There are many ways to keep track of your medicines. A pill organizer may help. Try one or more methods and see what works for you.  - If you have a hospital stay, bring your medicine list with you. Talk with your provider about medicine safety while you are in the hospital.

When to Call the Doctor : Call if you have questions or you are confused about the directions for your medicine. Call if you have any side effects from your medicines. DO NOT stop taking any medicine unless your health care provider tells you to stop.)

ADAM_0004154_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Using over-the-counter medicines safely
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm
Answer: Summary : Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are drugs you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using OTC the medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.  Here is what you need to know about OTC drugs.

About OTC Medicines : You can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:  - Drug stores  - Grocery stores  - Discount and department stores  - Convenience stores  - Some gas stations    When used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:  - Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea  - Preventing problems like heartburn or motion sickness  - Treating conditions such as athletes foot, allergies, or migraine headaches  - Providing first aid

When Should you Use OTC Medicines : It is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:  - Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition  - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take  - What side effects or problems to watch for    Your pharmacist can answer questions such as:  - What the medicine will do  - How it should be stored  - Whether another medicine might work as well or better

What the Label can Tell you : You can also get information about OTC drugs on the medicine label.  Most OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.  Here is what the label will show you:  - Active Ingredient. This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose.  - Uses. The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, DO NOT use the medicine for any condition not listed.  - Warnings. Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. Some medicines you should not take when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose.  - Directions. The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Fully read the directions, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages.  - Other information. This includes such things as how to store the medicine.  - Inactive ingredients. Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.    The label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.

Other Ways to Use OTC Medicines Safely : You should:  - Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with.  - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place you bought it.  - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container.  - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.    Also be sure to take steps to keep kids safe. You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a684056.html
Answer: Nicotine chewing gum is used to help people stop smoking cigarettes. Nicotine chewing gum should be used together with a smoking cessation program, which may include support groups, counseling, or specific behavioral change techniques. Nicotine gum is in a class of medications called smoking cessation aids. It works by providing nicotine to your body to decrease the withdrawal symptoms experienced when smoking is stopped and as a substitute oral activity to reduce the urge to smoke.)

MPlusDrugs_0000860_Sec2.txt,"Question: How should Nicotine Gum be used and what is the dosage ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a684056.html
Answer: Nicotine gum is used by mouth as a chewing gum and should not be swallowed. Follow the directions on your package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nicotine gum exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed on the package label or as recommended by your doctor.  If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, use the 2-mg gum. People who smoke their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up should use the 4-mg gum. Nicotine gum may be used regularly by chewing one piece of gum every 1 to 2 hours for the first 6 weeks, followed by one piece every 2 to 4 hours for 3 weeks, and then one piece every 4 to 8 hours for 3 weeks. If you have strong or frequent cravings, you may chew a second piece within one hour. To improve your chances of quitting smoking, chew at least 9 pieces of nicotine gum each day for the first 6 weeks.  Chew nicotine gum slowly until you can taste the nicotine or feel a slight tingling in your mouth. Then stop chewing and place (park) the chewing gum between your cheek and gum. When the tingling is almost gone (about 1 minute), start chewing again; repeat this procedure for about 30 minutes. Avoid eating and drinking for 15 minutes before and during chewing of nicotine gum.  Do not chew nicotine gum too fast, do not chew more than one piece of gum at a time, and do not chew one piece too soon after another. Chewing one piece of gum after another continuously may cause hiccups, heartburn, nausea, or other side effects.  Do not chew more than 24 pieces a day.  You should stop using nicotine gum after 12 weeks of use. If you still feel the need to use nicotine gum after 12 weeks, talk to your doctor.)

ADAM_0001386_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Endometrial ablation (Also called: Hysteroscopy-endometrial ablation; Laser thermal ablation; Endometrial ablation-radiofrequency; Endometrial ablation-thermal balloon ablation; Rollerball ablation; Hydrothermal ablation; Novasure ablation)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007632.htm
Answer: Summary : Endometrial ablation is a surgery or procedure done to damage the lining of the uterus in order to minimize heavy or prolonged menstrual flow. This lining is called the endometrium.

Description : Most often, a tool called a hysteroscope is used. It is a thin, lighted tube. It sends images of the inside of the womb to a video monitor.  - Most times, the procedure is performed under general anesthesia, but sometimes it is performed in the office under light sedation.  - The health care provider places the scope through the vagina and cervix and into the womb.  - Gas or fluid may be placed into the womb so it expands. This helps the provider see the area better.  - Pictures of the womb can be seen on the video screen.   Small tools can be used through the scope to remove abnormal growths or tissue for examination. Ablation uses heat, cold, or electricity to destroy the lining of the womb.  The procedure takes about 45 minutes.

Why the Procedure is Performed : This procedure can treat heavy or irregular periods. Your doctor will likely have tried other treatments first, such as hormone medicines or an IUD.  Endometrial ablation will not be used if you may want to become pregnant in the future. Though this procedure does not prevent you from getting pregnant, it may reduce your chances of getting pregnant. Reliable contraception is important in all women who get the procedure.  If a woman gets pregnant after an ablation procedure, the pregnancy will often miscarry or be extremely high risk because of the scar tissue in the uterus.

Risks : Risks of hysteroscopy include:   - Hole (perforation) in the wall of the womb  - Scarring of the lining of the womb  - Damage to the cervix  - Need for surgery to repair damage   Risks of any pelvic surgery include:  - Damage to nearby organs or tissues  - Blood clots, which could travel to the lungs and be deadly (rare)   Risks of anesthesia include:  - Nausea and vomiting  - Dizziness  - Headache  - Breathing problems  - Lung infection   Risks of any surgery include:  - Infection  - Bleeding

Before the Procedure : A biopsy of the endometrium or lining of the uterus will be performed in the weeks prior to the procedure. Younger women may be treated with a hormone that blocks estrogen from being made by the body for 1 to 3 months before the procedure.  Your health care provider may prescribe medicine to open your cervix. This makes it easier to insert the scope. You need to take this medicine about 8 to 12 hours before your procedure.  Before any surgery:   - Always tell your provider about all the medicines you take. This includes vitamins, herbs, and supplements.  - Tell your provider if you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, or other health problems.   In the 2 weeks before your procedure:  - You may need to stop taking drugs that make it hard for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), clopidogrel (Plavix), and warfarin (Coumadin). Your provider will tell you what you should or should not take.  - Ask your provider which medicines you can take on the day of your procedure.  - Tell your provider if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes outbreak, or other sickness.  - You will be told when to arrive at the hospital. Ask if you need to arrange for someone to drive you home.   On the day of the procedure:  - You may be asked not to drink or eat anything 6 to 12 hours before your procedure.  - Take any approved drugs with a small sip of water.

After the Procedure : You may go home the same day. Rarely, you may need to stay overnight.  - You may have menstrual-like cramps and light vaginal bleeding for 1 to 2 days. Ask your provider if you can take over-the-counter pain medicine for the cramping.  - You may have a watery discharge for up to several weeks.  - You can return to normal daily activities within 1 to 2 days. Do not have sex until your provider says it is OK.  - Any biopsy results are usually available with 1 to 2 weeks.   Your doctor will tell you the results of your procedure.

Outlook (Prognosis) : The lining of your uterus heals by scarring. Women will most often have less menstrual bleeding after this procedure. Up to 30 to 50% of women will completely stop having periods. This result is more likely in older women.)

Answer: Summary : Vegetables are an important part of a well-balanced diet. Many people wonder if frozen and canned vegetables are as healthy for you as fresh vegetables.  Overall, vegetables fresh from the farm or just picked are healthier than frozen or canned ones. But frozen and canned vegetables can still be a good choice. They need to be canned or frozen right after being harvested, when they still have all of their healthy nutrients.  Also, keep in mind how much salt is added to canned vegetables. Try to buy those without added salt and don't overcook any vegetable, whether fresh, frozen, or canned. Instead of boiling them in water for longer periods of time, they should be lightly steamed.)

Answer: Heart block is a problem in the electrical signals in the heart.  Normally, the heart beat starts in an area in the top chambers of the heart (atria). This area is the heart's pacemaker. The electrical signals travel to the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). This keeps the heart beat steady and regular.   Heart block occurs when the electrical signal is slowed down or does not reach the bottom chambers of the heart. Your heart may beat slowly, or it may skip beats. Heart block may resolve on its own, or it may be permanent and require treatment.  There are three degrees of heart block. First-degree heart block is the mildest type and third-degree is the most severe.  First-degree heart block:  - Rarely has symptoms   Second-degree heart block:  - The electrical impulse may not reach the lower chambers of the heart.  - The heart may miss a beat or beats and may be slow and irregular.  - You may feel dizzy, faint, or have other symptoms.   Third-degree heart block:  - The electrical signal does not move to the lower chambers of the heart. In this case, the lower chambers beat at a much slower rhythm, and the upper and lower chambers do not beat at the same rate.  - The heart fails to pump enough blood to the body. This can lead to fainting and shortness of breath.  - This is an emergency that needs medical help right away.)

Answer: Your health care provider will most likely send you to a heart doctor (cardiologist) to check for heart block.  The cardiologist will talk to you about your medical history and the medicines you are taking. The cardiologist will also:  - Do a complete physical exam. The doctor will check you for signs of heart failure, such asswollen ankles and feet.  - Do an ECG test to check the electrical signals in your heart.  - You may need to wear a heart monitor for 24 to 48 hours or longer to check the electrical signals in your heart.)

ADAM_0002002_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Holter monitor (24h) (Also called: Ambulatory electrocardiography; Electrocardiography - ambulatory)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003877.htm
Answer: Summary : A Holter monitor is a machine that continuously records the heart's rhythms. The monitor is worn for 24 - 48 hours during normal activity.

How the Test is Performed : Electrodes (small conducting patches) are stuck onto your chest. These are attached by wires to a small recording monitor. You carry the Holter monitor in a pocket or pouch worn around your neck or waist. The monitor runs on batteries.   While you wear the monitor, it records your heart's electrical activity.   - Keep a diary of what activities you do while wearing the monitor, and how you feel.  - After 24 to 48 hours, you will return the monitor to your doctor's office.  - The doctor will look at the records and see if there have been any abnormal heart rhythms.     It is very important that you accurately record your symptoms and activities so the doctor can match them with your Holter monitor findings.  Electrodes must be firmly attached to the chest so the machine gets an accurate recording of the heart's activity.  While wearing the device, avoid:  - Electric blankets  - High-voltage areas  - Magnets  - Metal detectors    Continue your normal activities while wearing the monitor. You may be asked to exercise while being monitored if your symptoms have occurred in the past while you were exercising.

How to Prepare for the Test : You do not need to prepare for the test.   Your doctor will start the monitor. You'll be told how to replace the electrodes if they fall off or get loose.  Tell your doctor if you are allergic to any tape or other adhesives. Make sure you shower or bathe before you start the test. You will not be able to do so while you are wearing a Holter monitor.

How the Test will Feel : This is a painless test. However, some people may need to have their chest shaved so the electrodes can stick.  You must keep the monitor close to your body. This may make it hard for you to sleep.

Why the Test is Performed : Holter monitoring is used to determine how the heart responds to normal activity. The monitor may also be used:  - After a heart attack  - To diagnose heart rhythm problems  - When starting a new heart medicine    It may be used to diagnose:  - Atrial fibrillation or flutter  - Multifocal atrial tachycardia  - Palpitations  - Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia  - Reasons for fainting  - Slow heart rate (bradycardia)  - Ventricular tachycardia

Normal Results : Normal variations in heart rate occur with activities. A normal result is no significant changes in heart rhythms or pattern.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may include various arrhythmias. Changes may mean that the heart is not getting enough oxygen.  The monitor may also detect conduction block, a condition in which the atrial electrical activity is either delayed or does not continue into the ventricles of the heart.

Risks : There are no risks associated with the test. However, you should be sure not to let the monitor get wet.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007395.htm
Answer: Varicose veins most often develop in the legs. They often stick out and are blue in color.  - Normally, valves in your veins keep your blood flowing up toward the heart, so the blood does not collect in one place.  - The valves in varicose veins are either damaged or missing. This causes the veins to become filled with blood, especially when you are standing.    The following treatments for varicose veins can be done in a health care provider's office or clinic. You will receive local anesthesia to numb your leg. You will be awake, but will not feel pain.  Sclerotherapy works best for spider veins. These are small varicose veins.  - Salt water (saline) or a chemical solution is injected into the varicose vein.  - The vein will harden and then disappear.    Laser treatment can be used on the surface of the skin. Small bursts of light make small varicose veins disappear.  Phlebectomy treats surface varicose veins. Very small cuts are made near the damaged vein. Then the vein is removed. One method uses a light under the skin to guide treatment.   This may be done along with other procedures, such as ablation.  Ablation uses intense heat to treat the vein. There are two methods. One uses radiofrequency energy and the other uses laser energy. During these procedures:  - Your doctor will puncture the varicose vein.  - Your doctor will thread a flexible tube (catheter) through the vein up to your groin.  - The catheter will send intense heat to the vein. The heat will close off and destroy the vein and the vein will disappear over time.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002952.htm
Answer: Summary : Vein stripping is surgery to remove varicose veins in the legs.

Description : Varicose veins are swollen,twisted, and enlarged veins that you can see under the skin. They are often red orblue in color. They usually appear inthe legs, but can occur in other parts of the body.  Normally, valves in your veins keep your blood flowing up toward the heart, so the blood does not collect in one place. The valves in varicose veins are either damaged or missing. This causes the veins to become filled with blood, especially when you are standing.  Vein stripping is used to remove or tie off a large vein in the leg called the superficial saphenous vein. This helps treat varicose veins.  Vein stripping usually takes about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. You may receive either:   - General anesthesia,in whichyou will be asleep and unable to feel pain.  - Spinal anesthesia, which will make the lower half of your body feel numb. You may also get medicine to help you relax.    During surgery:  - Your surgeon will make two or three small cuts in your leg.  - The cuts are near the top, middle, and bottom of your damaged vein. One is in your groin. The otherwill befarther down your leg, either in your calf or ankle.  - Your surgeon will then thread a thin, flexible plastic wire into the vein through your groin andguide the wirethrough the vein toward the other cut farther down your leg.  - The wire is then tied to the vein and pulled out through the lower cut, which pulls the vein out with it.  - If you have other damaged veins near the surface ofyour skin, your surgeon may also make small cuts over them to remove them or tie them off. This is called ambulatory phlebectomy.  - The doctor will close the cuts with stitches.  - You willwear bandages and compression stockings on your leg after the procedure.

Why the Procedure is Performed : The doctor may recommend vein stripping for:  - Varicose veins that cause problems with blood flow  - Leg pain and heaviness  - Skin changes or sores that are caused by too much pressure in the veins  - Blood clots or swelling in the veins  - Improving the appearance of your leg  - Varicose veins that can't be treated with newer procedures    Today, doctors are doing fewer vein stripping surgeries because there are newer, non-surgical ways to treat varicose veins that don't require general anesthesia and are done without an overnight hospital stay. These treatments are less painful and have a much faster recovery time.

Risks : Vein stripping is usually safe. Ask your doctor about any problems that might occur.  The risks from any anesthesia include:  - Allergic reactions to medicines  - Breathing problems   The risks from any surgery include:  - Bleeding  - Bruising  - Infection   The risks from vein stripping include:  - Bruising or scarring  - Nerve injury  - Return of varicose veins over time

Before the Procedure : Always tell your doctor or nurse:  - If you are or could be pregnant  - Whatdrugs you are taking; includingdrugs,supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription  - If you have been drinking more than 1 or 2 alcoholic drinks a day   During the days before your surgery:  - You may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other drugs that make it hard for your blood to clot.  - Ask your doctor which medications you should still take on the day of your surgery.  - If you smoke, try to stop. Your doctor or nurse can help. Smoking will slow your healing and recovery.    On the day of your surgery:  - You will likely be asked not to drink or eat anything for at least 6to 8 hours before surgery.  - Take your prescribed medications with a small sip of water.

After the Procedure : Your legs will be wrapped with bandages to control swelling and bleeding for 3to 5 days after surgery. You may need to keep them wrapped for several weeks.

Outlook (Prognosis) : Surgical vein stripping reduces pain and improves the appearance of your leg. Rarely, vein stripping causes scars.Mild leg swelling can occur. Be sure you regularly wear compression stockings.)

CDC_0000054_Sec7.txt,"Question: how can botulism be prevented?
URL: http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/botulism/
Answer: Many cases of botulism are preventable. Foodborne botulism has often been from home-canned foods with low acid content, such as asparagus, green beans, beets and corn and is caused by failure to follow proper canning methods. However, seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade, with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture, at retail, or by consumers; some examples are chopped garlic in oil, canned cheese sauce, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice, and baked potatoes wrapped in foil. In Alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods. Persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods, and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners/cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the US Department of Agriculture. Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs. Most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust.  The bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.  Honey can contain the bacteria that causes infant botulism so, children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey. Honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and older.)

ADAM_0003302_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Pulse (Also called: Heart rate; Heart beat)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003399.htm
Answer: Summary : The pulse is the number of heartbeats per minute.

How the Test is Performed : The pulse can be measured at areas where an artery passes close to the skin. These areas include the:  -  Back of the knees   -  Groin   -  Neck   -  Temple   -  Top or inner side of the foot   -  Wrist    To measure the pulse at the wrist, place the index and middle finger over the underside of the opposite wrist, below the base of the thumb. Press with flat fingers until you feel the pulse.  To measure the pulse on the neck, place the index and middle fingers just to the side of the Adam's apple, in the soft, hollow area. Press gently until you locate the pulse.   Note: Sit or lie down before taking the neck pulse. The neck arteries in some people are sensitive to pressure. Fainting or slowing of the heartbeat can result. Also, do not take the pulses on both sides of the neck at the same time. Doing so can slow the flow of blood to the head and lead to fainting.  Once you find the pulse, count the beats for1 full minute. Or count the beatsfor 30 seconds and multiply by 2. This will give the beats per minute.

How to Prepare for the Test : To determine the resting heart rate, you must have been resting for at least 10 minutes. Take the exercise heart rate while you are exercising.

How the Test will Feel : There is a slight pressure from the fingers.

Why the Test is Performed : Measuring the pulse gives important information about your health. Any change from your normal heart rate can indicate a health problem. Fast pulse may signal an infection or dehydration. In emergency situations, the pulse rate can help determine if the patient's heart is pumping.  Pulse measurement has other uses as well. During or immediately after exercise, the pulse rate gives information about your fitness level and health.

Normal Results : For resting heart rate:  - Newborns 0 to 1 month old: 70 to 190 beats per minute  - Infants 1 to 11 months old: 80 to 160 beats per minute  - Children 1 to 2 years old: 80 to 130 beats per minute  - Children 3 to 4 years old: 80 to 120 beats per minute  - Children 5 to 6 years old: 75 to 115 beats per minute  - Children 7 to 9 years old: 70 to 110 beats per minute  - Children 10 years and older, and adults (including seniors): 60 to 100 beats per minute  - Well-trained athletes: 40 to 60 beats per minute

What Abnormal Results Mean : Resting heart rates that are continually high (tachycardia) may mean a problem. Talk to a health care provider about this. Also discuss resting heart rates that are below the normal values (bradycardia).  A pulse that is very firm (bounding pulse) and that lasts for more than a few minutes should be checked by your provider as well. An irregular pulse can also indicate a problem.  A pulse that is hard to locate may mean blockages in the artery. These blockages are common in people with diabetes or hardening of the artery from high cholesterol. Your provider may order a test known as a Doppler study to check the blockages.)

MPlusHealthTopics_0000054_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Arrhythmia ? (Also called: Irregular heartbeat)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/arrhythmia.html
Answer: An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. It means that your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. When the heart beats faster than normal, it is called tachycardia. When the heart beats too slowly, it is called bradycardia. The most common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation, which causes an irregular and fast heart beat.    Many factors can affect your heart's rhythm, such as having had a heart attack, smoking, congenital heart defects, and stress. Some substances or medicines may also cause arrhythmias.     Symptoms of arrhythmias include       - Fast or slow heart beat    - Skipping beats    - Lightheadedness or dizziness    - Chest pain    - Shortness of breath     - Sweating        Your doctor can run tests to find out if you have an arrhythmia. Treatment to restore a normal heart rhythm may include medicines, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker, or sometimes surgery.

NHLBI_0000008_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Arrhythmia ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/arr
Answer: Espaol
                
An arrhythmia (ah-RITH-me-ah) is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm.
                
A heartbeat that is too fast is called tachycardia (TAK-ih-KAR-de-ah). A heartbeat that is too slow is called bradycardia (bray-de-KAR-de-ah).
                
Most arrhythmias are harmless, but some can be serious or even life threatening. During an arrhythmia, the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body. Lack of blood flow can damage the brain, heart, and other organs.
                
Understanding the Heart's Electrical System
                
To understand arrhythmias, it helps to understand the heart's internal electrical system. The heart's electrical system controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat.
                
With each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom. As the signal travels, it causes the heart to contract and pump blood.
                
Each electrical signal begins in a group of cells called the sinus node or sinoatrial (SA) node. The SA node is located in the heart's upper right chamber, the right atrium (AY-tree-um). In a healthy adult heart at rest, the SA node fires off an electrical signal to begin a new heartbeat 60 to 100 times a minute.
                
From the SA node, the electrical signal travels through special pathways in the right and left atria. This causes the atria to contract and pump blood into the heart's two lower chambers, the ventricles (VEN-trih-kuls).
                
The electrical signal then moves down to a group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node, located between the atria and the ventricles. Here, the signal slows down just a little, allowing the ventricles time to finish filling with blood.
                
The electrical signal then leaves the AV node and travels along a pathway called the bundle of His. This pathway divides into a right bundle branch and a left bundle branch. The signal goes down these branches to the ventricles, causing them to contract and pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.
                
The ventricles then relax, and the heartbeat process starts all over again in the SA node. (For more information about the heart's electrical system, including detailed animations, go to the Health Topics How the Heart Works article.)
                
A problem with any part of this process can cause an arrhythmia. For example, in atrial fibrillation (A-tre-al fi-bri-LA-shun), a common type of arrhythmia, electrical signals travel through the atria in a fast and disorganized way. This causes the atria to quiver instead of contract.
                
Outlook
                
There are many types of arrhythmia. Most arrhythmias are harmless, but some are not. The outlook for a person who has an arrhythmia depends on the type and severity of the arrhythmia.
                
Even serious arrhythmias often can be successfully treated. Most people who have arrhythmias are able to live normal, healthy lives.) 
"
NHLBI_0000008_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Arrhythmia ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/arr
Answer: An arrhythmia can occur if the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are delayed or blocked. This can happen if the special nerve cells that produce electrical signals don't work properly. It also can happen if the electrical signals don't travel normally through the heart.
                
An arrhythmia also can occur if another part of the heart starts to produce electrical signals. This adds to the signals from the special nerve cells and disrupts the normal heartbeat.
                
Smoking, heavy alcohol use, use of some drugs (such as cocaine or amphetamines), use of some prescription or over-the-counter medicines, or too much caffeine or nicotine can lead to arrhythmias in some people.
                
Strong emotional stress or anger can make the heart work harder, raise blood pressure, and release stress hormones. Sometimes these reactions can lead to arrhythmias.
                
A heart attack or other condition that damages the heart's electrical system also can cause arrhythmias. Examples of such conditions include high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, heart failure, an overactive or underactive thyroid gland (too much or too little thyroid hormone produced), and rheumatic heart disease.
                
Congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defects can cause some arrhythmias, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The term ""congenital means the defect is present at birth.
                
Sometimes the cause of arrhythmias is unknown.)

Answer: Normally, your heart works as a pump that brings blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.  To help this happen, your heart has an electrical system that makes sure it contracts (squeezes) in an orderly way.  - The electrical impulse that signals your heart to contract begins in the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node). This is your heart's natural pacemaker.  - The signal leaves the SA node and travels through the heart along a set electrical pathway.  - Different nerve messages signal your heart to beat slower or faster.    Arrhythmias are caused by problems with the heart's electrical conduction system.   - Abnormal (extra) signals may occur.  - Electrical signals may be blocked or slowed.  - Electrical signals travel in new or different pathways through the heart.    Some common causes of abnormal heartbeats are:  - Abnormal levels of potassium or other substances in the body  - Heart attack, or a damaged heart muscle from a past heart attack  - Heart disease that is present at birth (congenital)  - Heart failure or an enlarged heart  - Overactive thyroid gland        Watch this video about:   Arrhythmias     Arrhythmias may also be caused by some substances or drugs, including:  - Alcohol, caffeine, or stimulant drugs   - Heart or blood pressure medicines  - Cigarette smoking (nicotine)  - Drugs that mimic the activity of your nervous system  - Medicines used for depression or psychosis    Sometimes medicines used to treat one type of arrhythmia will cause another type of abnormal heart rhythm.   Some of the more common abnormal heart rhythms are:  - Atrial fibrillation or flutter  - Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT)  - Heart block or atrioventricular block  - Multifocal atrial tachycardia  - Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia  - Sick sinus syndrome  - Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia  - Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome)

Answer: The doctor will listen to your heart with a stethoscope and feel your pulse. Your blood pressure may be low or normal.  Heart monitoring devices are often used to identify the rhythm problem, such as a:   - Holter monitor (used for 24 hours)  - Event monitor or loop recorder (worn for 2 weeks or longer)    Other tests may be done to look at heart function:  - Coronary angiography  - ECG (electrocardiogram)  - Echocardiogram   A special test, called an electrophysiology study (EPS), is done to take a closer look at the heart's electrical system.)

NHLBI_0000008_Sec5.txt,"Question: How to diagnose Arrhythmia ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/arr
Answer: Arrhythmias can be hard to diagnose, especially the types that only cause symptoms every once in a while. Doctors diagnose arrhythmias based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.
                
Specialists Involved
                
Doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases include:
                
Cardiologists. These doctors diagnose and treat adults who have heart problems.
                
Pediatric cardiologists. These doctors diagnose and treat babies, children, and youth who have heart problems.
                
Electrophysiologists. These doctors are cardiologists or pediatric cardiologists who specialize in arrhythmias.
                
Medical and Family Histories
                
To diagnose an arrhythmia, your doctor may ask you to describe your symptoms. He or she may ask whether you feel fluttering in your chest and whether you feel dizzy or light-headed.
                
Your doctor also may ask whether you have other health problems, such as a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems. He or she may ask about your family's medical history, including whether anyone in your family:
                
Has a history of arrhythmias
                
Has ever had heart disease or high blood pressure
                
Has died suddenly
                
Has other illnesses or health problems
                
Your doctor will likely want to know what medicines you're taking, including over-the-counter medicines and supplements.
                
Your doctor may ask about your health habits, such as physical activity, smoking, or using alcohol or drugs (for example, cocaine). He or she also may want to know whether you've had emotional stress or anger.
                
Physical Exam
                
During a physical exam, your doctor may:
                
Listen to the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat
                
Listen to your heart for a heart murmur (an extra or unusual sound heard during your heartbeat)
                
Check your pulse to find out how fast your heart is beating
                
Check for swelling in your legs or feet, which could be a sign of an enlarged heart or heart failure
                
Look for signs of other diseases, such as thyroid disease, that could be causing the problem
                
Diagnostic Tests and Procedures
                
EKG (Electrocardiogram)
                
An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. It's the most common test used to diagnose arrhythmias.
                
An EKG shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). It also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.
                
A standard EKG only records the heartbeat for a few seconds. It won't detect arrhythmias that don't happen during the test.
                
To diagnose arrhythmias that come and go, your doctor may have you wear a portable EKG monitor. The two most common types of portable EKGs are Holter and event monitors.
                
Holter and Event Monitors
                
A Holter monitor records the heart's electrical signals for a full 24- or 48-hour period. You wear one while you do your normal daily activities. This allows the monitor to record your heart for a longer time than a standard EKG.
                
An event monitor is similar to a Holter monitor. You wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities. However, an event monitor only records your heart's electrical activity at certain times while you're wearing it.
                
For many event monitors, you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms. Other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms.
                
Some event monitors are able to send data about your heart's electrical activity to a central monitoring station. Technicians at the station review the information and send it to your doctor. You also can use the device to report any symptoms you're having.
                
You can wear an event monitor for weeks or until symptoms occur.
                
Other Tests
                
Other tests also are used to help diagnose arrhythmias.
                
Blood tests. Blood tests check the level of substances in the blood, such as potassium and thyroid hormone. Abnormal levels of these substances can increase your chances of having an arrhythmia.
                
Chest x ray. A chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart and lungs. This test can show whether your heart is enlarged.
                
Echocardiography. This test uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. Echocardiography (echo) provides information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.
                
The test also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.
                
There are several types of echo, including stress echo. This test is done both before and after a stress test (see below). A stress echo usually is done to find out whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart, a sign of coronary heart disease (CHD).
                
A transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo, or TEE, is a special type of echo that takes pictures of the heart through the esophagus. The esophagus is the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach.
                
Stress test. Some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast.
                
The heart tests done during stress testing may include nuclear heart scanning, echo, and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of the heart.
                
Electrophysiology study (EPS). This test is used to assess serious arrhythmias. During an EPS, a thin, flexible wire is passed through a vein in your groin (upper thigh) or arm to your heart. The wire records your heart's electrical signals.
                
Your doctor can use the wire to electrically stimulate your heart and trigger an arrhythmia. This allows your doctor to see whether an antiarrhythmia medicine can stop the problem.
                
Catheter ablation, a procedure used to treat some arrhythmias, may be done during an EPS.
                
Tilt table testing. This test sometimes is used to help find the cause of fainting spells. You lie on a table that moves from a lying down to an upright position. The change in position may cause you to faint.
                
Your doctor watches your symptoms, heart rate, EKG reading, and blood pressure throughout the test. He or she may give you medicine and then check your response to the medicine.
                
Coronary angiography. Coronary angiography uses dye and special x rays to show the inside of your coronary arteries. To get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun).
                
A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream.
                
Special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels. This helps your doctor find blockages that can cause a heart attack.
                
Implantable loop recorder. This device detects abnormal heart rhythms. Minor surgery is used to place this device under the skin in the chest area.
                
An implantable loop recorder helps doctors figure out why a person may be having palpitations or fainting spells, especially if these symptoms don't happen very often. The device can be used for as long as 12 to 24 months.)

ADAM_0000682_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Cardiac ablation procedures (Also called: Catheter ablation; Radiofrequency catheter ablation; Cryoablation)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007368.htm
Answer: Summary : Cardiac ablation is a procedure that is used to scar small areas in your heart that may be involved in your heart rhythm problems. This can prevent the abnormal electrical signals or rhythms from moving through the heart.   During the procedure, small wires called electrodes are placed inside your heart to measure your heart's electrical activity. When the source of the problem is found, the tissue causing the problem is destroyed.

Description : There are two methods for performing cardiac ablation:   - Radiofrequency ablation uses heat energy to eliminate the problem area.  - Cryoablation uses very cold temperatures.    The type of procedure you have will depend on what kind of abnormal heart rhythm you have.   Cardiac ablation procedures are done in a hospital laboratory by trained staff. This includes cardiologists (heart doctors), technicians, and nurses. The setting is safe and controlled so your risk is as low as possible.   You will be given medicine (a sedative) before the procedure to help you relax.  - The skin on your neck, arm, or groin will be cleaned well and made numb with an anesthetic.  - Next, the doctor will make a small cut in the skin.  - A small, flexible tube (catheter) will be inserted through this cut into one of the blood vessels in the area. The doctor will use live x-ray images to carefully guide the catheter up into your heart.    Once the catheter is in place, your doctor will place small electrodes in different areas of your heart.  - These electrodes are connected to monitors that allow the cardiologist to tell what area in your heart is causing problems with your heart rhythm. In most cases, there are one or more specific areas.  - Once the source of the problem has been found, one of the catheter lines is used to send electrical (or sometimes cold) energy to the problem area.  - This creates a small scar that causes the heart rhythm problem to stop.    Catheter ablation is a long procedure. It can last 4 or more hours. During the procedure your heart will be monitored closely. A health care provider may ask you if you are having symptoms at different times during the procedure. Symptoms you may feel are:  - A brief burning when medicines are injected  - A faster or stronger heartbeat  - Light-headedness  - Burning when the electrical energy is used

Why the Procedure is Performed : Cardiac ablation is used to treat certain heart rhythm problems that medicines are not controlling. These problems may be dangerous if they are not treated.  Common symptoms of heart rhythm problems may include:  - Chest pain  - Fainting  - Slow or fast heartbeat (palpitations)  - Light-headedness, dizziness  - Paleness  - Shortness of breath  - Skipping beats - changes in the pattern of the pulse  - Sweating    Some heart rhythm problems are:  - AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)  - Accessory pathway, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome  - Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter  - Ventricular tachycardia

Risks : Catheter ablation is generally safe. Talk with your provider about these rare complications:  - Bleeding or blood pooling where the catheter is inserted  - Blood clot that goes to arteries in your leg, heart, or brain  - Damage to the artery where the catheter is inserted  - Damage to heart valves  - Damage to the coronary arteries (blood vessels that carry blood to your heart)  - Esophageal atrial fistula (a connection that forms between your esophagus and part of your heart)  - Fluid around the heart (cardiac tamponade)  - Heart attack  - Vagal or phrenic nerve damage

Before the Procedure : Always tell your provider what drugs you are taking, even drugs or herbs you bought without a prescription.  During the days before the procedure:  - Ask your provider which drugs you should still take on the day of the surgery.  - Tell your provider if you are taking aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), ticagrelor (Brilinta), warfarin (Coumadin), or another blood thinner.  - If you smoke, stop before the procedure. Ask your provider for help if you need it.  - Tell your provider if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness.    On the day of the procedure:  - You will most often be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before your procedure.  - Take the drugs your providerhas told you to take with a small sip of water.  - You will be told when to arrive at the hospital.

After the Procedure : Pressure to reduce bleeding is put on the area where the catheters were inserted into your body. You will be kept in bed for at least 1 hour. You may need to stay in bed for up to 5 or 6 hours. Your heart rhythm will be checked during this time.  Your doctor will decide whether you can go home on the same day, or if you will need to stay in the hospital overnight for continued heart monitoring. You will need someone to drive you home after your procedure.  For 2 or 3 days after your procedure, you may have these symptoms:  - Fatigue  - Achy feeling in your chest  - Skipped heartbeats, or times when your heartbeat is very fast or irregular.    Your doctor may keep you on your medicines, or give you new ones that help control your heart rhythm.

Outlook (Prognosis) : Success rates are different depending on what type of heart rhythm problem is being treated.)

ADAM_0001900_Sec3.txt,"Question: What is (are) Helping your teen with depression ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000646.htm
Answer: You, your teen, and your provider should discuss whether antidepressant medicine might help your teen. Medicine is more important if your teen is severely depressed. In these cases, talk therapy alone cannot be effective.  If you decide that medicine would help, your provider will most likely prescribe a type of anti-depressant medicine called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for your teen.  The two most common SSRI medicines are fluoxetine (Prozac) and escitalopram (Lexapro). These are approved to treat depression in teenagers. Prozac is also approved for children age 8 and older.  Another type of antidepressants, called tri-cyclics, is not approved for use in teens.  There are risks and side effects with taking antidepressants. Your teen's provider can help manage these side effects. In a small number of teens, these medicines can make them more depressed and give them more suicidal thoughts. If this happens, you or your teen should talk to the provider right away.  If you, your teen, and your provider decide that your teen will take an antidepressant, make sure that:  - You give it time to work. Finding the right drug and dose can take time. It could take 4 to 6 weeks to get to full effect.  - A psychiatrist, or other medical doctor, who treats depression in teens is watching for side effects.  - You and other caregivers watch your teen for suicidal thoughts or behaviors, and for nervousness, irritability, moodiness, or sleeplessness that is getting worse. Get medical help for these symptoms right away.  - Your teen does not stop taking the antidepressant on their own. Talk to your teen's provider first. If your teen decides to stop taking the antidepressant, your teen may be instructed to lower the dose slowly before stopping altogether.  - Keep your teen going to talk therapy.  - If your teen is depressed in the fall or winter, ask your doctor about light therapy. It uses a special lamp that acts like the sun and may help with depression.)

ADAM_0003190_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Pregnancy and work
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000609.htm
Answer: Summary : Most women who are pregnant can keep working during their pregnancy. Some women are able to work right up until they are ready to deliver. Others may need to cut back on their hours or stop working before their due date.  Whether you can work or not depends on:   - Your health  - The health of the baby  - The type of job you have   Below are some factors that affect your ability to work.

Heavy Lifting : If your job requires heavy lifting, you may need to stop working or reduce your work hours. Most women are advised to only lift things that weigh under 20 pounds during pregnancy. Repetitively lifting heavier amounts often causes back injury or disability.

Exposure to Workplace Hazards : If you work in a job where you are around hazards (poisons or toxins), you may need to change your role until after the baby is born. Some hazards that may pose a threat to your baby include:  - Hair colorants: When pregnant, avoid getting or giving hair treatments. Your hands could absorb the chemicals in the color.  - Chemotherapy drugs: These are drugs used to treat people with health problems like cancer. They are very strong drugs. They may affect health care workers like nurses or pharmacists.  - Lead: You could be exposed to lead if you work in lead smelting, paint/battery/glass making, printing, ceramics, pottery glazing, toll booths, and heavily traveled roads.  - Ionizing radiation: This applies to x-ray techs and people who work in some types of research. Also, airline flight attendants or pilots may need to reduce their flying time during pregnancy to reduce their radiation exposure.  Ask your employer about any hazards or poisons in your workplace:   - Are the levels toxic?  - Is the workplace ventilated (Is there proper airflow to let the chemicals out)?  - What system is in place to protect workers from hazards?

Carpal Tunnel : If you work on a computer, you may notice numbness or tingling in your hands. This may be carpal tunnel syndrome. The numbness and tingling is caused by your body holding onto extra fluid.  The fluid causes swelling of tissues, which pinch down on the nerves in the hands. It is common in pregnancy as women retain extra fluid.  The symptoms may come and go. They often feel worse at night. Most often, they get better after you give birth. If the pain is causing you problems, you can try a few things for relief:  - If you work at a computer, adjust the height of your chair so your wrists aren't bent downward as you type.  - Take short breaks to move your arms and stretch your hands.  - Try a wrist or hand brace or an ergonomic keyboard.  - Sleep with a splint or brace on your hands, or prop your arms on pillows.  - If pain or tingling wakes you up at night, shake your hands until it goes away.    If your symptoms get worse or affect your daily life, talk to your health care provider.

Stress : Stress at work, and everywhere else, is a normal part of life. But too much stress can lead to health problems for you and your baby. Stress can also affect how well your body can fight off infection or disease.  A few tips to deal with stress:  - Talk about your worries with your partner or a friend.  - See your provider for regular prenatal care.  - Follow a healthy diet and stay active.  - Get plenty of sleep each night.  - Meditate.    Ask for help when you need it. If you are having a hard time dealing with stress, tell your provider. Your provider may refer you to a counselor or therapist who can help you better manage the stress in your life.)

ADAM_0004085_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Understanding health insurance plans
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000879.htm
Answer: Summary : Most insurance companies offer different types of health plans. And when you are comparing plans, it can sometimes seem like alphabet soup. What is the difference between an HMO, PPO, POS, and EPO? Do they offer the same coverage?  This guide to health plans can help you understand each type of plan. Then you can more easily choose the right plan for you and your family.

Types of Health Insurance Plans : Depending on how you get your health insurance, you may have a choice of different types of plans.  Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). These plans offer a network of health care providers and low monthly premiums. The providers have a contract with the health plan. This means they charge a set rate for services. You will choose a primary care doctor. This person will manage your care and refer you to specialists. If you use doctors, hospitals, and other providers from the plan's network, you pay less out of pocket. If you use providers outside of the network, you will have to pay more.  Exclusive Provider Organizations (EPOs). These are plans that offer networks of providers and low monthly premiums. You must use the doctors, hospitals, and other providers from the network list to keep your out-of-pocket costs low. If you see providers outside of the network, your costs will be much higher. With EPOs, you do not need a primary care doctor to manage your care and give you referrals.  Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs). PPOs offer a network of providers and the choice to see providers outside of the network for a bit more money. You do not need a primary care doctor to manage your care. You will pay more in premiums for this plan compared to an HMO, but you have a bit more freedom to see providers inside and outside the network without the need for referrals.  Point-of-Service (POS) plans. POS plans are like a PPO. They offer both in-network and out-of-network benefits. You can see any in-network providers without a referral. But you DO need a referral to see out-of-network providers. You may save some money in monthly premiums with this type of plan compared to a PPO.  High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs). This type of plan offers low monthly premiums and high yearly deductibles. A HDHP may be one of the plan types above with a high deductible. A deductible is a set amount of money you have to pay before your insurance starts to pay. For 2015, HDHPs have a deductible of $1300 per person and $2600 per family per year or more. People with these plans often get a medical savings or reimbursement account. This helps you save money for the deductible and other out-of-pocket costs. It can also help you save money on taxes.   Fee for Service (FFS) plans are not as common today. These plans offer freedom to see any doctor or hospital of your choice. The plan pays a set amount for each service, and you pay the rest. You do not need referrals. Sometimes you pay for the service up front, file a claim, and the plan reimburses you. This is a costly health insurance plan when it does not include a network or PPO option.  Catastrophic plans offer benefits for basic services and major illness or injury. They protect you from the cost of a major accident or illness. These plans do not have good coverage for people with health problems who need regular care or tests. You can only buy a catastrophic plan if you are under age 30 or can prove you cannot afford health coverage. The monthly premiums are low, but the deductibles for these plans are quite high. As an individual, your deductible may be about $6,000. You will need to pay the high deductible before the insurance starts paying.

What is Right for Me? : When choosing a plan, think about your medical needs and preferences. In addition to the plan type, make sure you compare the benefits, out-of-pocket costs, and provider network for a good fit.)

ADAM_0004181_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Vaginal dryness alternative treatments ? (Also called: Alternative treatments for vaginal dryness)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002142.htm
Answer: Question:   Is there a drug-free treatment for vaginal dryness?   Answer:   There are many causes of vaginal dryness. It may be caused by reduced estrogen levels, infection, medicines, and other things. Before treating yourself, talk to your health care provider.   Water-based lubricants and vaginal moisturizers work very well. Lubricants will moisten the vaginal opening and lining for several hours. The effects of a vaginal cream can last for up to a day.  Soybeans contain plant-based substances called isoflavones. These substances have an effect of the body that is similar to estrogen, but weaker. Therefore, it would seem that a diet rich in soy foods would improve symptoms of vaginal dryness. There continues to be research in this area, but the ideal sources or dose is still unknown. Soy foods include tofu, soy milk, and whole soybeans (also called edamame).  Many women claim that creams containing wild yam help with vaginal dryness. However, there is no good research that has evaluated these creams. Also, extracts of wild yam have not been found to have estrogen- or progesterone-like activities. Some of the products may have synthetic medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) added. MPA is a derivative of progesterone, and is also used in oral contraceptives. Like all supplements, MPA-containing products should be used with caution.  Black cohosh is an herb that some women use as a dietary supplement to relieve menopausal symptoms. However, it is not known if this herb helps with vaginal dryness.)

ADAM_0004326_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Working during cancer treatment
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000834.htm
Answer: Summary : Many people continue to work throughout their cancer treatment. Cancer, or the side effects of treatment, may make it hard to work on some days.   Understanding how treatment may affect you at work can help you and your coworkers know what to expect. Then you can plan ahead so that you can keep working with as little interruption as possible.

How Cancer May Affect You at Work : If you feel well enough, you may find that the daily routine of a job helps you maintain a sense of balance. But having unrealistic goals could cause extra stress. If possible, prepare yourself for the ways cancer could affect you at work:  - You may need to take time off for treatments.  - You may get tired more easily.  - At times, you could be distracted by pain or stress.  - You could have trouble remembering some things.

Tips to Help You Work During Treatment : There are ways you can plan ahead to make working through cancer easier on you and your co-workers.  - Schedule treatments late in the day so you can go home afterwards.  - Try to schedule chemotherapy at the end of the week so you have the weekend to recover.  - Talk to your manager about working at home some days, if possible. You can spend less time commuting and rest when you need to.  - Let your boss know your treatment schedule and when you will be out of work.  - Ask your family and friends to help around the house. This will leave you more energy for work.

How to Talk to Coworkers About Cancer : Consider letting your co-workers know you have cancer. It might be easier to work if you do not have to make excuses for taking time off. Some co-workers may offer to help out if you have to be out of the office.  - Consider talking first to one or two people you trust. They might have ideas of how to share the news with your other coworkers.  - Decide in advance how much information you want to share. The right amount will depend on you and your work culture.  - Be matter of fact when you share the news. Share the basic facts: that you have cancer, are getting treatment, and plan to keep working.    Some people may have an emotional reaction to the news. Your job is to take care of yourself. You do not have to help every person you know deal with their feelings about cancer.   Some co-workers may say things that are not helpful. They may want to talk about cancer when you want to work. They may ask for details that you do not want to share. Some people might try to give you advice about your treatment. Be ready with responses like:  - ""I would rather not discuss that at work.""  - ""I need to focus on this project right now.""  - ""That is a private decision I will make with my doctor.""

If You Can Not Work : Some people find that working through treatment is too difficult. Taking time off from work might be the best thing you can do for your health and your job. If your work performance is suffering, taking time off will allow your employer to bring in temporary help.   Your right to return to work after treatment is protected under federal law. You cannot be fired for being sick.  Depending on how long you need to be out of work, short-term or long-term disability may cover some of your salary while you are not working. Even if you plan to work through treatment, it is a good idea to find out if your employer has disability insurance. You can get an application for both short and long-term disability in case you need to apply later.

When to Call the Doctor : Talk to your health care provider about how you feel at work, and if you should consider taking time off. If you do, your provider can help you fill out an application for disability coverage.)

ADAM_0004327_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Working with a personal trainer
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000875.htm
Answer: Summary : If you have had a hard time sticking with regular exercise, you may want to hire a personal trainer. Personal trainers are not only for athletes. They can help people of all ages and abilities reach their fitness goals. A personal trainer can help you create a fitness plan that is right for you and help you stick with it.

The Benefits of a Personal Trainer : A personal trainer can:  - Assess your current level of fitness  - Help you find an exercise program that is safe and works well for you  - Help you set and achieve realistic fitness goals  - Teach you the correct way to do exercises  - Help you get the most out of your workout time  - Offer support, guidance, and feedback  - Provide motivation to continue exercising  - Work with your doctor or other health care professionals to create an exercise program if you are recovering from an illness or injury  - Offer advice on lifestyle changes to improve fitness

Affording a Personal Trainer : Of course, hiring a personal trainer does cost money. The hourly rate for trainers can range from $20 to $100 an hour. These costs vary depending on the trainer's location, experience, and type of workout.   Hiring a trainer may be more affordable than you think. Some trainers will charge less if you commit to a long-term package or pay for all your sessions upfront. You can also save money if you do 30-minute sessions or do sessions with a friend or group.   Here are some questions to ask about the cost:  - How much do you charge for a session?  - How long are your sessions?  - What services do I get for that price?  - Are there any other fees I need to pay (such as gym membership)?  - Do you offer any discounts or package deals?  - Do you offer any group sessions that are less expensive?

Choosing a Personal Trainer : You can find personal trainers in your area by asking friends, family members, or coworkers for referrals. Or you can check with local fitness centers and health clubs. Before you hire a personal trainer, meet with that person and ask about his or her training and experience. Here are some things to look for:  - Training. Make sure your personal trainer has credentials. Look for National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) accredited certification. Another plus is a trainer who has a college degree in exercise science, physical education, or a related field. This shows that the trainer has a solid background in fitness.  - Experience. Find out how long he or she has been a personal trainer. Ask about what types of clients the trainer typically works with. If you have a health condition, ask about the trainer's experience working with others who have had this condition. You can also ask for references from other clients.  - Personality. It is important to find a personal trainer you like and think you can work with. Ask yourself if the trainer explains things in a way you can understand and seems open to your questions and concerns.  - Schedule. Make sure the trainer can work within your schedule. Ask about cancellation policies and if you have to pay for sessions you need to cancel.

Know the Limits of Your Personal Trainer : Personal trainers can offer you professional advice on exercise. They can also provide general tips on living a healthy lifestyle. But be wary of a trainer who wants to offer more than that. Personal trainers are guided by a code of ethics and scope of practice for their field. Some red flags to watch for include:  - Offering medical advice. Your trainer can give you tips for a healthy lifestyle, but he or she should not tell you how to treat a medical condition.  - Going against your health care provider's orders. If your provider has set limits on the type or amount of exercise you can do, your trainer should stay within these limits.  - Touching you inappropriately. Your trainer may need to touch you as part of the instruction. If this makes you uncomfortable, let your trainer know. He or she should be able to instruct you without touching you at all. Your trainer should never touch you in any way that is sexual.  - Selling nutritional supplements. Your trainer should not prescribe or sell you nutritional supplements. Providers and dietitians are the only health professionals qualified to give specific nutritional advice.

When to Call Your Doctor : If you have been inactive for awhile, or have a medical condition, you should talk with your health care provider to make sure you are healthy enough for exercise.)

GHR_0000046_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) alternating hemiplegia of childhood ? (Also called: alternating hemiplegia syndrome)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/alternating-hemiplegia-of-childhood
Answer: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis, often affecting one side of the body (hemiplegia). During some episodes, the paralysis alternates from one side of the body to the other or affects both sides at the same time. These episodes begin in infancy or early childhood, usually before 18 months of age, and the paralysis lasts from minutes to days.  In addition to paralysis, affected individuals can have sudden attacks of uncontrollable muscle activity; these can cause involuntary limb movements (choreoathetosis), muscle tensing (dystonia), movement of the eyes (nystagmus), or shortness of breath (dyspnea). People with alternating hemiplegia of childhood may also experience sudden redness and warmth (flushing) or unusual paleness (pallor) of the skin. These attacks can occur during or separately from episodes of hemiplegia.  The episodes of hemiplegia or uncontrolled movements can be triggered by certain factors, such as stress, extreme tiredness, cold temperatures, or bathing, although the trigger is not always known. A characteristic feature of alternating hemiplegia of childhood is that all symptoms disappear while the affected person is sleeping but can reappear shortly after awakening. The number and length of the episodes initially worsen throughout childhood but then begin to decrease over time. The uncontrollable muscle movements may disappear entirely, but the episodes of hemiplegia occur throughout life.  Alternating hemiplegia of childhood also causes mild to severe cognitive problems. Almost all affected individuals have some level of developmental delay and intellectual disability. Their cognitive functioning typically declines over time.)

GHR_0000046_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to alternating hemiplegia of childhood ? (Also called: alternating hemiplegia syndrome)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/alternating-hemiplegia-of-childhood
Answer: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is primarily caused by mutations in the ATP1A3 gene. Very rarely, a mutation in the ATP1A2 gene is involved in the condition. These genes provide instructions for making very similar proteins. They function as different forms of one piece, the alpha subunit, of a larger protein complex called Na+/K+ ATPase; the two versions of the complex are found in different parts of the brain. Both versions play a critical role in the normal function of nerve cells (neurons). Na+/K+ ATPase transports charged atoms (ions) into and out of neurons, which is an essential part of the signaling process that controls muscle movement.  Mutations in the ATP1A3 or ATP1A2 gene reduce the activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase, impairing its ability to transport ions normally. It is unclear how a malfunctioning Na+/K+ ATPase causes the episodes of paralysis or uncontrollable movements characteristic of alternating hemiplegia of childhood.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/alternating-hemiplegia-of-childhood
Answer: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is considered an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases of alternating hemiplegia of childhood result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. However, the condition can also run in families. For unknown reasons, the signs and symptoms are typically milder when the condition is found in multiple family members than when a single individual is affected.)

GHR_0000490_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Huntington disease-like syndrome ? (Also called: Huntington disease-like syndromes; Huntington's disease-like syndromes; Huntington's disease phenocopies; Huntington's disease phenocopy syndromes)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/huntington-disease-like-syndrome
Answer: As its name suggests, a Huntington disease-like (HDL) syndrome is a condition that resembles Huntington disease. Researchers have described four HDL syndromes, designated Huntington disease-like 1 (HDL1) through Huntington disease-like 4 (HDL4). These progressive brain disorders are characterized by uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. HDL syndromes occur in people with the characteristic features of Huntington disease who do not have a mutation in HD, the gene typically associated with that disorder.  HDL1, HDL2, and HDL4 usually appear in early to mid-adulthood, although they can begin earlier in life. The first signs and symptoms of these conditions often include irritability, emotional problems, small involuntary movements, poor coordination, and trouble learning new information or making decisions. Many affected people develop involuntary jerking or twitching movements known as chorea. As the disease progresses, these abnormal movements become more pronounced. Affected individuals may develop problems with walking, speaking, and swallowing. People with these disorders also experience changes in personality and a decline in thinking and reasoning abilities. Individuals with an HDL syndrome can live for a few years to more than a decade after signs and symptoms begin.  HDL3 begins much earlier in life than most of the other HDL syndromes (usually around age 3 or 4). Affected children experience a decline in thinking ability, difficulties with movement and speech, and seizures. Because HDL3 has a somewhat different pattern of signs and symptoms and a different pattern of inheritance, researchers are unsure whether it belongs in the same category as the other HDL syndromes.)

GHR_0000509_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness ? (Also called: HID syndrome; ichthyosis, hystrix-like, with deafness)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hystrix-like-ichthyosis-with-deafness
Answer: Hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness (HID) is a disorder characterized by dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis) and hearing loss that is usually profound. Hystrix-like means resembling a porcupine; in this type of ichthyosis, the scales may be thick and spiky, giving the appearance of porcupine quills.  Newborns with HID typically develop reddened skin. The skin abnormalities worsen over time, and the ichthyosis eventually covers most of the body, although the palms of the hands and soles of the feet are usually only mildly affected. Breaks in the skin may occur and in severe cases can lead to life-threatening infections. Affected individuals have an increased risk of developing a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma, which can also affect mucous membranes such as the inner lining of the mouth. People with HID may also have patchy hair loss caused by scarring on particular areas of skin.)

GHR_0000509_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness ? (Also called: HID syndrome; ichthyosis, hystrix-like, with deafness)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hystrix-like-ichthyosis-with-deafness
Answer: HID is caused by mutations in the GJB2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called gap junction beta 2, more commonly known as connexin 26. Connexin 26 is a member of the connexin protein family. Connexin proteins form channels called gap junctions that permit the transport of nutrients, charged atoms (ions), and signaling molecules between neighboring cells that are in contact with each other. Gap junctions made with connexin 26 transport potassium ions and certain small molecules.  Connexin 26 is found in cells throughout the body, including the inner ear and the skin. In the inner ear, channels made from connexin 26 are found in a snail-shaped structure called the cochlea. These channels may help to maintain the proper level of potassium ions required for the conversion of sound waves to electrical nerve impulses. This conversion is essential for normal hearing. In addition, connexin 26 may be involved in the maturation of certain cells in the cochlea. Connexin 26 also plays a role in the growth and maturation of the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis).  At least one GJB2 gene mutation has been identified in people with HID. This mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in connexin 26. The mutation is thought to result in channels that constantly leak ions, which impairs the health of the cells and increases cell death. Death of cells in the skin and the inner ear may underlie the signs and symptoms of HID.  Because the GJB2 gene mutation identified in people with HID also occurs in keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome (KID syndrome), a disorder with similar features and the addition of eye abnormalities, many researchers categorize KID syndrome and HID as a single disorder, which they call KID/HID. It is not known why some people with this mutation have eye problems while others do not.)

Answer: Summary : Health insurance helps protect you from high medical care costs. It is a contract between you and your insurance company. You buy a plan or policy, and the company agrees to pay part of your expenses when you need medical care.    Many people in the United States get a health insurance policy through their employers. In most cases, the employer helps pay for that insurance. Insurance through employers is often with a managed care plan. These plans contract with health care providers and medical facilities to provide care for members at reduced costs. You can also purchase health insurance on your own.    People who meet certain requirements can qualify for government health insurance, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act expands health insurance coverage for many people in the U.S.)

URL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/alternatinghemiplegia/alternatinghemiplegia.htm
Answer: Alternating hemiplegia is a rare neurological disorder that develops in childhood, most often before the child is 18 months old. The disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of paralysis that involve one or both sides of the body, multiple limbs, or a single limb. The paralysis may affect different parts of the body at different times and may be brief or last for several days. Oftentimes these episodes will resolve after sleep. Affected children may also have abnormal movements involving stiffening or ""dance-like"" movements of a limb, as well as walking and balance problems. Some children have seizures. Children may have normal or delayed development. There are both benign and more serious forms of the disorder. Most children do not have a family history of the disorder; however, recent studies have show that some children with a family history have mutations in the genes CACNA1A, SCN1A, and ATP1A2. Mutations in the ATP1A2 gene have previously been associated with families affect by familial hemiplegic migraine.)

ADAM_0000179_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Am I in labor? (Also called: False labor; Braxton Hicks contractions; Prodromal labor; Latent labor; Pregnancy - labor)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000508.htm
Answer: Summary : If you've never given birth before, you may think you'll just know when the time comes. In reality, it isn't always easy to know when you're going into labor. The steps leading up to labor can drag on for days.  Keep in mind that your due date is just a general idea of when your labor may start. Normal term labor can start any time between 3 weeks before and 2 weeks after this date.

False labor (Braxton Hicks contractions) : Most pregnant women feel mild contractions before true labor begins. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions, which:  - Are typically short  - Are not painful  - Do not come at regular intervals  - Are not accompanied by bleeding, leaking fluid, or decreased fetal movement    This stage is called ""prodromal"" or ""latent"" labor.

Other signs that labor is near : Lightening: This happens when your baby's head ""drops"" down into your pelvis.   - Your belly will look lower. It will be easier for you to breathe because the baby is not putting pressure on your lungs.  - You may need to urinate more often because the baby is pressing on your bladder.  - For first-time mothers, lightening often happens a few weeks before birth. For women who have had babies before, it may not happen until labor has begun.    Bloody show: If you have bloody or brownish discharge from your vagina, it may mean your cervix has begun to dilate. The mucous plug that sealed your cervix for the last 9 months may be visible. This is a good sign. But active labor may still be days away.   Your baby moves less: If you feel less movement, call your doctor or midwife, as sometimes decreased movement can mean that the baby is in trouble.   Your water breaks: When the amniotic sac (bag of fluid around the baby) breaks, you will feel fluid leak from your vagina. It may come out in a trickle or a gush.   - For most women, contractions come within 24 hours after the bag of water breaks.  - Even if contractions don't begin, let your doctor or midwife know as soon as you think your water has broken.    Diarrhea: Some women have the urge to go to the bathroom often to empty their bowels. If this happens and your stools are looser than normal, you may be going into labor.   Nesting: There's no science behind the theory, but plenty of women feel the sudden urge to ""nest"" right before labor starts. If you feel the need to vacuum the entire house at 3 a.m., or finish your work in the baby's nursery, you may be getting ready for labor.

True labor : In real labor, your contractions will:   - Come regularly and get closer together  - Last from 30 to 70 seconds, and will get longer  - Not stop, no matter what you do  - Radiate (reach) into your lower back and upper belly  - Get stronger or become more intense as time goes on  - Make you unable to talk to other people or laugh at a joke

When to call the doctor or midwife : Call your doctor or midwife right away if you have:   - Leaking amniotic fluid  - Decreased fetal movement  - Any vaginal bleeding other than light spotting  - Regular, painful contractions every 5 to 10 minutes for 60 minutes   Call for any other reason if you are unsure what to do.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003201.htm
Answer: Summary : Uncontrollable movements include many types of movements that you cannot control. They can affect the arms, legs, face, neck, or other parts of the body.  Examples of uncontrollable movements are:  - Loss of muscle tone (flaccidity)  - Slow, twisting, or continued movements (chorea, athetosis, or dystonia)  - Sudden jerking movements (myoclonus, ballismus)  - Uncontrollable repetitive movements (asterixis or tremor)

Causes : There are many causes of uncontrolled movements. Some movements last only a short time. Others are due to a permanent condition of the brain and spinal cord and may get worse.  Some of these movements affect children. Others affect only adults.  Causes in children:  - Genetic disorder  - Kernicterus (too much bilirubin in the central nervous system)  - Lack of oxygen (hypoxia) at birth    Causes in adults:  - Nervous system diseases that are getting worse  - Genetic disorder  - Medicines  - Stroke or brain injury  - Tumors

Home Care : Physical therapy that includes swimming, stretching, walking, and balancing exercises can help with coordination and slow the damage.  Family support is important. It helps to openly discuss your feelings. Self-help groups are available in many communities.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Call your health care provider if you have any unexplained movements that you cannot control that do not go away.

What to Expect at Your Office Visit : The provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms and medical history. You will have a detailed examination of both the nervous and muscle systems.  Medical history questions may include:  - Are there muscle contractions that may be causing the abnormal posture?  - Are the arms affected?  - Are the legs affected?  - When did this movement begin?  - Did it occur suddenly?  - Has it been getting worse slowly over weeks ormonths?  - Is it present all the time?  - Is it worse after exercise?  - Is it worse when you are stressed?  - Is it better after sleep?  - What makes it better?  - What other symptoms are present?    Tests that may be ordered include:  - Blood tests (such as CBC or blood differential)  - CT scan of the head or affected area  - EEG  - Lumbar puncture  - MRI of the head or affected area  - Urinalysis   Treatment depends on the cause. Many uncontrollable movements are treated with medicines. Some symptoms may improve on their own. Your provider will make recommendations based on your signs and symptoms.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003037.htm
Answer: The involuntary eye movements of nystagmus are caused by abnormal function in the areas of the brain that control eye movements. The part of the inner ear that senses movement and position (the labyrinth) helps control eye movements.  There are two forms of nystagmus:  - Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is present at birth (congenital).  - Acquired nystagmus develops later in life because of a disease or injury.)

GHR_0000720_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) nephronophthisis ? (Also called: NPH; NPHP)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/nephronophthisis
Answer: Nephronophthisis is a disorder that affects the kidneys. It is characterized by inflammation and scarring (fibrosis) that impairs kidney function. These abnormalities lead to increased urine production (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), general weakness, and extreme tiredness (fatigue). In addition, affected individuals develop fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, usually in an area known as the corticomedullary region. Another feature of nephronophthisis is a shortage of red blood cells, a condition known as anemia.  Nephronophthisis eventually leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a life-threatening failure of kidney function that occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to filter fluids and waste products from the body effectively. Nephronophthisis can be classified by the approximate age at which ESRD begins: around age 1 (infantile), around age 13 (juvenile), and around age 19 (adolescent).  About 85 percent of all cases of nephronophthisis are isolated, which means they occur without other signs and symptoms. Some people with nephronophthisis have additional features, which can include liver fibrosis, heart abnormalities, or mirror image reversal of the position of one or more organs inside the body (situs inversus).  Nephronophthisis can occur as part of separate syndromes that affect other areas of the body; these are often referred to as nephronophthisis-associated ciliopathies. For example, Senior-Lken syndrome is characterized by the combination of nephronophthisis and a breakdown of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retinal degeneration); Joubert syndrome affects many parts of the body, causing neurological problems and other features, which can include nephronophthisis.)

ADAM_0002679_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Movement - uncontrolled or slow (Also called: Dystonia; Involuntary slow and twisting movements; Choreoathetosis; Leg and arm movements - uncontrollable; Arm and leg movements - uncontrollable; Slow involuntary movements of large muscle groups; Athetoid movements)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003197.htm
Answer: Summary : Uncontrolled or slow movement is a problem with muscle tone, usually in the large muscle groups. The problem leads to slow, uncontrollable jerky movements of the head, limbs, trunk, or neck.

Considerations : The abnormal movement may be reduced or disappear during sleep. Emotional stress makes it worse.  Abnormal and sometimes strange postures may occur because of these movements.

Causes : The slow twisting movements of muscles (athetosis) or jerky muscle contractions (dystonia) may be caused by one of manyconditions, including:  - Cerebral palsy  - Drug side effects  - Encephalitis  - Genetic diseases  - Hepatic encephalopathy  - Huntington disease  - Stroke    Sometimes two conditions (such as a brain injury and medication) interact to cause the abnormal movements when neither one alone would cause a problem.

Home Care : Get enough sleep and avoid too much stress. Take safety measures to avoid injury. Follow the treatment plan your doctor prescribes.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Call your health care provider if:  - You have unexplained movements that you cannot control  - The problem is getting worse  - Uncontrolled movements occur with other symptoms

What to Expect at Your Office Visit : The doctor will perform a physical exam. This may include a detailed examination of the nervous and muscle systems.  The doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms, including:  - When did you develop this problem?  - Is it always the same?  - Is it always present or only sometimes?  - Is it getting worse?  - Is it worse after exercise?  - Is it worse during times of emotional stress?  - Have you been injured or in an accident recently?  - Have you been sick recently?  - Is it better after you sleep?  - Does anyone else in your family have a similar problem?  - What other symptoms do you have?  - What medicines are you taking?    Tests that may be ordered include:  - Blood studies (such as metabolic panel,complete blood count (CBC), blood differential)  - CT scan of the head or affected area  - EEG  - EMG and nerve conduction velocity studies (sometimes done)  - Genetic studies  - Lumbar puncture  - MRI of the head or affected area  - Urinalysis   Treatment is based on the movement problem the person has and on the condition that may be causing the problem. If medicines are used, the health care provider will decide which medicine to prescribe based on the person's symptoms and any test results.)

Answer: The symptoms of NPH usually get worse over time if the condition is not treated, although some people may experience temporary improvements. While the success of treatment with shunts varies from person to person, some people recover almost completely after treatment and have a good quality of life.

NINDS_0000155_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus ?
URL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/normal_pressure_hydrocephalus/normal_pressure_hydrocephalus.htm
Answer: Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain's ventricles, or cavities. It occurs if the normal flow of CSF throughout the brain and spinal cord is blocked in some way. This causes the ventricles to enlarge, putting pressure on the brain. Normal pressure hydrocephalus can occur in people of any age, but it is most common in the elderly. It may result from a subarachnoid hemorrhage, head trauma, infection, tumor, or complications of surgery. However, many people develop NPH even when none of these factors are present. In these cases the cause of the disorder is unknown.
                
Symptoms of NPH include progressive mental impairment and dementia, problems with walking, and impaired bladder control. The person also may have a general slowing of movements or may complain that his or her feet feel ""stuck."" Because these symptoms are similar to those of other disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the disorder is often misdiagnosed. Many cases go unrecognized and are never properly treated. Doctors may use a variety of tests, including brain scans (CT and/or MRI), a spinal tap or lumbar catheter, intracranial pressure monitoring, and neuropsychological tests, to help them diagnose NPH and rule out other conditions.)

CDC_0000054_Sec5.txt,"Question: how can botulism be treated?
URL: http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/botulism/
Answer: The respiratory failure and paralysis that occur with severe botulism may require a patient to be on a breathing machine (ventilator) for weeks or months, plus intensive medical and nursing care. The paralysis slowly improves. Botulism can be treated with an antitoxin which blocks the action of toxin circulating in the blood. Antitoxin for infants is available from the California Department of Public Health, and antitoxin for older children and adults is available through CDC.If given before paralysis is complete, antitoxin can prevent worsening and shorten recovery time. Physicians may try to remove contaminated food still in the gut by inducing vomiting or by using enemas. Wounds should be treated, usually surgically, to remove the source of the toxin-producing bacteria followed by administration of appropriate antibiotics. Good supportive care in a hospital is the mainstay of therapy for all forms of botulism.)

Answer: Depression is a serious medical illness. It's more than just a feeling of being sad or ""blue"" for a few days. If you are one of the more than 19 million teens and adults in the United States who have depression, the feelings do not go away. They persist and interfere with your everyday life. Symptoms can include       - Feeling sad or ""empty""    - Loss of interest in favorite activities    - Overeating, or not wanting to eat at all    - Not being able to sleep, or sleeping too much    - Feeling very tired    - Feeling hopeless, irritable, anxious, or guilty    - Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems    - Thoughts of death or suicide       Depression is a disorder of the brain. There are a variety of causes, including genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Depression can happen at any age, but it often begins in teens and young adults. It is much more common in women. Women can also get postpartum depression after the birth of a baby. Some people get seasonal affective disorder in the winter.

NIHSeniorHealth_0000014_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Depression ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/depression/toc.html
Answer: Everyone feels blue or sad now and then, but these feelings don't usually last long and pass within a couple of days. When a person has depression, it interferes with daily life and normal functioning, and causes pain for both the person with depression and those who care about him or her. Doctors call this condition ""depressive disorder,"" or ""clinical depression."" Depression in Older Adults Important life changes that happen as we get older may cause feelings of uneasiness, stress, and sadness. For instance, the death of a loved one, moving from work into retirement, or dealing with a serious illness can leave people feeling sad or anxious. After a period of adjustment, many older adults can regain their emotional balance, but others do not and may develop depression. Depression is a common problem among older adults, but it is NOT a normal part of aging. In fact, studies show that most older adults feel satisfied with their lives, despite having more physical ailments. However, when older adults do suffer from depression, it may be overlooked because they may be less willing to talk about feelings of sadness or grief, or they may show different, less obvious symptoms, and doctors may be less likely to suspect or spot it. Sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish grief from major depression. Grief after loss of a loved one is a normal reaction to the loss and generally does not require professional mental health treatment. However, grief that lasts for a very long time following a loss may require treatment. Test Depression and Suicide Though it is widely believed that suicide more often affects young people, suicide is a serious problem among older adults, too  particularly among older men  and depression is usually a major contributing factor. Adults 65 and older have a suicide rate that is higher than the rate for the national population, but there are some major differences between older men and women. While suicide rates for older women are somewhat lower than those for young and middle-aged women, rates among men 75 and older are higher than those for younger men. In fact, white men age 85 and older have the highest suicide rate in the United States. Types of Depression There are several types of depression. The most common types are major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. - Major depressive disorder, also called major depression or clinical depression, is characterized by a combination of symptoms that interfere with a person's ability to work, sleep, concentrate, eat, and enjoy activities he or she once liked. Major depression prevents a person from functioning normally. An episode of major depression may occur only once in a person's lifetime, but more often, it recurs throughout a person's life.   - Dysthymic disorder, also called dysthymia, is a less severe but more long-lasting form of depression. Dysthymia is characterized by symptoms lasting two years or longer that keep a person from functioning normally or feeling well. People with dysthymia may also experience one or more episodes of major depression during their lifetime.  Major depressive disorder, also called major depression or clinical depression, is characterized by a combination of symptoms that interfere with a person's ability to work, sleep, concentrate, eat, and enjoy activities he or she once liked. Major depression prevents a person from functioning normally. An episode of major depression may occur only once in a person's lifetime, but more often, it recurs throughout a person's life. Dysthymic disorder, also called dysthymia, is a less severe but more long-lasting form of depression. Dysthymia is characterized by symptoms lasting two years or longer that keep a person from functioning normally or feeling well. People with dysthymia may also experience one or more episodes of major depression during their lifetime. Other types of depression include subsyndromal depression, psychotic depression. and bipolar depression. - Subsyndromal depression  is common among older adults. It includes less severe but clear symptoms of depression that fall short of being major depression or dysthymia. Having subsyndromal depression may increase a person's risk of developing major depression.  - Psychotic depression occurs when a person has severe depression plus some form of psychosis, such as having disturbing false beliefs or a break with reality (delusions), or hearing or seeing upsetting things that others cannot hear or see (hallucinations).  - Bipolar depression, also called manic-depressive illness, is not as common as major depression or dysthymia. Bipolar disorder is characterized by cycling mood changesfrom extreme highs (e.g., mania) to extreme lows (e.g., depression).  Subsyndromal depression  is common among older adults. It includes less severe but clear symptoms of depression that fall short of being major depression or dysthymia. Having subsyndromal depression may increase a person's risk of developing major depression. Psychotic depression occurs when a person has severe depression plus some form of psychosis, such as having disturbing false beliefs or a break with reality (delusions), or hearing or seeing upsetting things that others cannot hear or see (hallucinations).

Answer: Doctors do not know the exact causes of depression. It is believed that chemical changes in the brain are responsible. This may be due to a problem with your genes. Or it may be triggered by certain stressful events. More likely, it is a combination of both.  Some types of depression run in families. Other types occur even if you have no family history of the illness. Anyone can develop depression, including children and teens.   Depression may be brought on by:  - Alcohol or drug use  - Certain medical problems, such as underactive thyroid, cancer, or long-term pain  - Some kinds of medicines, such as steroids  - Sleeping problems  - Stressful life events, such as death or illness of someone close to you, divorce, childhood abuse or neglect, loneliness (common in the elderly), relationship breakup)

Answer: Depression can change or distort the way you see yourself, your life, and those around you.  With depression, you often see everything in a negative way. It is hard for you to imagine that a problem or situation can be solved in a positive way.   Symptoms of depression can include:  -  Agitation, restlessness, and irritability, anger   -  Becoming withdrawn or isolated   -  Fatigue and lack of energy   -  Feeling hopeless and helpless, worthless, guilty, self-hate   -  Loss of interest or pleasure in activities that were once enjoyed   -  Sudden change in appetite, often with weight gain or loss   -  Thoughts of death or suicide   -  Trouble concentrating   -  Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much    Depression in teens may be harder to recognize. Problems with school, behavior, or alcohol or drug use can all be signs.  If depression is very severe, you may have hallucinations and delusions (false beliefs).

ADAM_0002497_Sec5.txt,"Question: What are the treatments for Major depression ? (Also called: Depression - major; Depression - clinical; Clinical depression; Unipolar depression; Major depressive disorder)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000945.htm
Answer: Depression can be treated. Treatment includes medicines, talk therapy, or both.  If you are thinking about suicide or are very depressed and cannot function, you may need to be treated in a hospital.  After you have been on treatment, if you feel your symptoms are getting worse, talk with your provider. Your treatment plan may need to be changed.  MEDICINES  Antidepressants are medicines used to treat depression. They work by bringing back the chemicals in your brain to the right levels. This helps relieve your symptoms.  If you have delusions or hallucinations, your provider may prescribe additional medicines.  Tell your provider about any other medicines you take. Some medicines can change the way antidepressants work in your body.  Allow your medicine time to work. It may take a few weeks before you feel better. Keep taking your medicine as instructed. DO NOT stop taking it or change the amount (dosage) you are taking without talking to your provider. Ask your doctor about possible side effects, and what to do if you have any.  If you feel your medicine is not working, tell your provider. The medicine or its dosage may need to be changed. DO NOT stop taking medicines on your own.  WARNING: Children, teens, and young adults should be watched closely for suicidal behavior. This is especially true during the first few months after starting medicines for depression.  Women being treated for depression who are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant should not stop taking antidepressants without first talking to their provider.   Beware of natural remedies such as St. John's wort. This is an herb sold without a prescription. It may help some people with mild depression. But it can change the way other medicines work in your body, including antidepressants. Talk to your provider before trying this herb.  TALK THERAPY  Talk therapy is counseling to talk about your feelings and thoughts, and help you learn how to deal with them.  Types of talk therapy include:  - Cognitive behavioral therapy teaches you how to fight off negative thoughts. You learn how to become more aware of your symptoms and how to spot things that make your depression worse. You are also taught problem-solving skills.  - Psychotherapy can help you understand the issues that may be behind your thoughts and feelings.  - At group therapy, you share with others who have problems like yours. Your therapist or doctor can tell you more about group therapy.    OTHER TREATMENTS FOR DEPRESSION  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may improve mood in people with severe depression or suicidal thoughts who do not get better with other treatments. ECT is generally safe.  - Light therapy may relieve depression symptoms in the winter time. This type of depression is called seasonal affective disorder.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000945.htm
Answer: You may start feeling better a few weeks after starting treatment. If you take medicine, you will need to stay on the medicine for several months to feel good and prevent depression from returning. If your depression keeps coming back, you may need to stay on your medicine for a long period.  Chronic depression may make it harder for you to manage other illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease. Ask your doctor for help in managing these health problems.  Alcohol or drug use can make depression worse. Talk to your doctor about getting help.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000918.htm
Answer: There are a number of things you can try to improve PDD:  - Get enough sleep.  - Follow a healthy, nutritious diet.  - Take medicines correctly. Discuss any side effects with your doctor.  - Learn to watch for early signs that yourPDD is getting worse. Have a plan for how to respond if it does.  - Try to exercise regularly.  - Look for activities that make you happy.  - Talk to someone you trust about how you are feeling.  - Surround yourself with people who are caring and positive.  - Avoid alcohol and illegal drugs. These can make your mood worse over time and impair your judgment.   Medicines are often effective for PDD, though they sometimes do not work as well as they do for major depression and theymay take longer to work.  Do not stop taking your medicine on your own, even if you feel better or have side effects. Always call your doctor first.  When it is time to stop your medicine, your doctor will instruct you on how toslowly reduce the dose instead of stopping suddenly.  People withPDD may also be helped by some type of talk therapy. Talk therapy is a good place to talk about feelings and thoughts, and to learn ways to deal with them. Types of talk therapy include:  - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps you learn to be more aware of your symptoms and what makes them worse. You will be taught problem-solving skills.  - Insight-oriented or psychotherapy, which can help people withPDD understand factors that may be behind their depressive thoughts and feelings.    Joining a support group for people who are having problems like yours can also help. Ask your therapist or health care provider to recommend a group.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a685041.html
Answer: Naltrexone comes as a tablet to take by mouth either at home or under supervision in a clinic or treatment center. When naltrexone is taken at home, it is usually taken once a day with or without food. When naltrexone is taken in a clinic or treatment center, it may be taken once a day, once every other day, once every third day, or once every day except Sunday. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take naltrexone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Naltrexone is only helpful when it is used as part of an addiction treatment program. It is important that you attend all counseling sessions, support group meetings, education programs, or other treatments recommended by your doctor.  Naltrexone will help you avoid using drugs and alcohol, but it will not prevent or relieve the withdrawal symptoms that may occur when you stop using these substances. Instead, naltrexone may cause or worsen withdrawal symptoms. You should not take naltrexone if you have recently stopped using opioid medications or opioid street drugs and are now experiencing withdrawal symptoms.  Naltrexone will help you avoid drugs and alcohol only as long as you are taking it. Continue to take naltrexone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking naltrexone without talking to your doctor.)

Answer: Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver.     Viruses cause most cases of hepatitis. The type of hepatitis is named for the virus that causes it; for example, hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Drug or alcohol use can also cause hepatitis. In other cases, your body mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the liver.    Some people who have hepatitis have no symptoms. Others may have       - Loss of appetite    - Nausea and vomiting    - Diarrhea    - Dark-colored urine and pale bowel movements    - Stomach pain    - Jaundice, yellowing of skin and eyes       Some forms of hepatitis are mild, and others can be serious. Some can lead to scarring, called cirrhosis, or to liver cancer.    Sometimes hepatitis goes away by itself. If it does not, it can be treated with drugs. Sometimes hepatitis lasts a lifetime.

Answer: The hepatitis A virus is found mostly in the stools and blood of an infected person. The virus is present about 15 to 45 days before symptoms occur and during the first week of illness.  You can catch hepatitis A if:  - You eat or drink food or water that has been contaminated by stools (feces) containing the hepatitis A virus. Fruits, vegetables, shellfish, ice, and water are common sources of the disease.  - You come in contact with the stool or blood of a person who currently has the disease.  - A person with hepatitis A passes the virus to an object or food due to poor hand-washing after using the bathroom.  - You take part in sexual practices that involve oral-anal contact.    Not everyone has symptoms with hepatitis A infection. Therefore, many more people are infected than are diagnosed or reported.   Risk factors include:   - Overseas travel, especially to Asia or South or Central America  - IV drug use  - Living in a nursing home center  - Working in a health care, food, or sewage industry    Other common hepatitis virus infections include hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Hepatitis A is the least serious and mildest of these diseases.)

ADAM_0001935_Sec8.txt,"Question: How to prevent Hepatitis A ? (Also called: Viral hepatitis; Infectious hepatitis)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000278.htm
Answer: The following tips can help reduce your risk of spreading or catching the virus:  - Always wash your hands well after using the restroom, and when you come in contact with an infected person's blood, stools, or other bodily fluid.  - Avoid unclean food and water.    The virus may spread more rapidly through day care centers and other places where people are in close contact. Thorough hand washing before and after each diaper change, before serving food, and after using the restroom may help prevent such outbreaks.  Ask your provider about getting either immune globulin or the hepatitis A vaccine if you are exposed to the disease and have not had hepatitis A or the hepatitis A vaccine.  Common reasons for getting one or both of these treatments include:  - You live with someone who has hepatitis A.  - You recently had sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis A.  - You recently shared illegal drugs, either injected or noninjected, with someone who has hepatitis A.  - You have had close personal contact over a period of time with someone who has hepatitis A.  - You have eaten in a restaurant where food or food handlers were found to be infected or contaminated with hepatitis    Vaccines that protect against hepatitis A infection are available. The vaccine begins to protect 4 weeks after you get the first dose. You will need to get a booster shot 6 to 12 months later for long-term protection.  Travelers should take the following steps to protect against getting the disease:  - Avoid dairy products.  - Avoid raw or undercooked meat and fish.  - Beware of sliced fruit that may have been washed in unclean water. Travelers should peel all fresh fruits and vegetables themselves.  - DO NOT buy food from street vendors.  - Get vaccinated against hepatitis A (and possibly hepatitis B) if traveling to countries where outbreaks of the disease occur.  - Use only carbonated bottled water for brushing teeth and drinking. (Remember that ice cubes can carry infection.)  - If bottled water is not available, boiling water is the best way to get rid of hepatitis A. Bring the water to a full boil for at least 1 minute to make it safe to drink.  - Heated food should be hot to the touch and eaten right away.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003158.htm
Answer: Keep your genital area clean and dry when you have vaginitis.   - Avoid soap and just rinse with water to clean yourself.   - Soak in a warm, not hot, bath may help your symptoms. Dry thoroughly afterward.   Avoid douching. Many women feel cleaner when they douche, but it may actually worsen symptoms because it removes healthy bacteria that line the vagina. These bacteria help protect against infection.   Other tips are:   - Avoid using hygiene sprays, fragrances, or powders in the genital area.   - Use pads and not tampons while you have an infection.   - If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar levels in good control.   Allow more air to reach your genital area. You can do this by:   - Wearing loose-fitting clothes and not wearing panty hose   - Wearing cotton underwear (rather than synthetic), or underwear that has a cotton lining in the crotch. Cotton increases air flow and decreases moisture buildup.   - Not wearing underwear at night when you sleep.   Girls and women should also:   - Know how to properly clean their genital area while bathing or showering.   - Wipe properly after using the toilet -- always from front to back.   - Wash thoroughly before and after using the bathroom.   Always practice safe sex, and use condoms to avoid catching or spreading infections.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003172.htm
Answer: Elbow pain can be caused by many problems. A common cause in adults is tendinitis. This is inflammation and injury to the tendons, which are soft tissues that attach muscle to bone.  People who play racquet sports are most likely to injure the tendons on the outside of the elbow. This condition is commonly called tennis elbow. Golfers are more likely to injure the tendons on the inside of the elbow.  Other common causes of elbow tendinitis are gardening, playing baseball, using a screwdriver, or overusing your wrist and arm.  Young children commonly develop ""nursemaid's elbow,"" usually when someone is pulling on their straightened arm. The bones are stretched apart momentarily and a ligament slips in between. It becomes trapped when the bones try to snap back into place. Children will usually quietly refuse to use the arm, but often cry out when they try to bend or straighten the elbow. This condition is also called an elbow subluxation (a partial dislocation).  Other common causes of elbow pain are:  - Bursitis -- inflammation of a fluid-filled cushion beneath the skin  - Arthritis -- narrowing of the joint space and loss of cartilage in the elbow  - Elbow strains  - Infection of the elbow)

ADAM_0002352_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Lead levels - blood (Also called: Blood lead levels)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003360.htm
Answer: Summary : Blood lead level is a test that measures the amount of lead in the blood.

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.  In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin.  - The blood collects in a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip.  - A bandage is put over the spot to stop any bleeding.

How to Prepare for the Test : No special preparation is needed.  For children, it may be helpful to explain how the test will feel and why it is done. This may make the child feel less nervous.

How the Test will Feel : You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.

Why the Test is Performed : This test is used to screen people at risk for lead poisoning. This may include industrial workers and children who live in urban areas. The test is also used to measure how well treatment for lead poisoning is working. Lead is common in the environment, so it is often found in the body in low levels.

Normal Results : Small amounts of lead in adults are not thought to be harmful. However, even low levels of lead can be dangerous to infants and children. It can cause lead poisoning that leads to problems in mental development.  Adults:  - Less than 10 micrograms per deciliter (dL) of lead in the blood    Children:  - Less than 5 micrograms/dL of lead in the blood    Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Adults who have been exposed to lead should have blood lead levels below 40 micrograms/dL. Treatment may be recommended if:  - Your blood lead level is greater than 80 micrograms/dL.  - You have symptoms of lead poisoning and your blood lead level is greater than 40 micrograms/dL.   In children:  - Blood lead level of5 micrograms/dL or greater requires further testing and monitoring.  - The source of lead must be found and removed.  - A lead level greater than 45 micrograms/dL in a child's blood usually indicates the need for treatment.  - Treatment may be considered with a level as low as 20 micrograms/dL.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/leadpoisoning.html
Answer: Lead is a metal that occurs naturally in the earth's crust. Lead can be found in all parts of our environment. Much of it comes from human activities such as mining and manufacturing. Lead used to be in paint; older houses may still have lead paint. You could be exposed to lead by       - Eating food or drinking water that contains lead. Water pipes in older homes may contain lead.    - Working in a job where lead is used    - Using lead in a hobby, such as making stained glass or lead-glazed pottery    - Using folk remedies such as herbs or foods that contain lead       Breathing air, drinking water, eating food, or swallowing or touching dirt that contains lead can cause many health problems. Lead can affect almost every organ and system in your body. In adults, lead can increase blood pressure and cause infertility, nerve disorders, and muscle and joint pain. It can also make you irritable and affect your ability to concentrate and remember.    Lead is especially dangerous for children. A child who swallows large amounts of lead may develop anemia, severe stomachache, muscle weakness, and brain damage. Even at low levels, lead can affect a child's mental and physical growth.

Answer: Avoid exposure to rodent urine and droppings.  - Drink disinfected water.  - When camping, sleep on a ground cover and pad.  - Keep your home clean. Clear out potential nesting sites and clean your kitchen.    If you must work in an area where contact with rodent urine or feces is possible, follow these recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):  - When opening an unused cabin, shed, or other building, open all the doors and windows, leave the building, and allow the space to air out for 30 minutes.  - Return to the building and spray the surfaces, carpet, and other areas with a disinfectant. Leave the building for another 30 minutes.  - Spray mouse nests and droppings with a 10% solution of chlorine bleach or similar disinfectant. Allow it to sit for 30 minutes. Using rubber gloves, place the materials in plastic bags. Seal the bags and throw them in the trash or an incinerator. Dispose of gloves and cleaning materials in the same way.  - Wash all potentially contaminated hard surfaces with a bleach or disinfectant solution. Avoid vacuuming until the area has been thoroughly decontaminated. Then, vacuum the first few times with enough ventilation. Surgical masks may provide some protection.  - If you have a heavy infestation of rodents, call a pest control company. They have special cleanup equipment and methods.)

CDC_0000212_Sec3.txt,"Question: how can hps be prevented for Hantavirus ?
URL: http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/
Answer: Eliminate or minimize contact with rodents in your home, workplace, or campsite. If rodents don't find that where you are is a good place for them to be, then you're less likely to come into contact with them. Seal up holes and gaps in your home or garage. Place traps in and around your home to decrease rodent infestation. Clean up any easy-to-get food.
  
Recent research results show that many people who became ill with HPS developed the disease after having been in frequent contact with rodents and/or their droppings around a home or a workplace. On the other hand, many people who became ill reported that they had not seen rodents or rodent droppings at all. Therefore, if you live in an area where the carrier rodents are known to live, try to keep your home, vacation place, workplace, or campsite clean.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hantavirusinfections.html
Answer: Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a rare but deadly viral infection. It is spread by mice and rats. They shed the virus in their urine, droppings, and saliva. Tiny droplets with the virus can enter the air. People can get the disease if they breathe infected air or come into contact with rodents or their urine or droppings. You cannot catch it from people.    Early symptoms of HPS include       -  Fatigue    -  Fever     -  Muscle aches, especially in the thighs, hips and back    -  Headaches    -  Chills    -  Dizziness    -  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain       Later symptoms include coughing and shortness of breath.     Controlling rodents in and around your house is the best way to prevent infection. If you have been around rodents and have symptoms of fever, deep muscle aches, and severe shortness of breath, see your doctor immediately.    There is no specific treatment, cure, or vaccine for HPS. Patients may do better if it is recognized early and they get medical care in an intensive care unit.

CDC_0000212_Sec2.txt,"Question: what are the symptoms for Hantavirus ?
URL: http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/
Answer: Due to the small number of HPS cases, the ""incubation time"" is not positively known. However, on the basis of limited information, it appears that symptoms may develop between 1 and 5 weeks after exposure to fresh urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents.
  Early Symptoms
  
    
   
Early symptoms include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groups—thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders. These symptoms are universal.
   
There may also be headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. About half of all HPS patients experience these symptoms.
  
  Late Symptoms
  
    
   
Four to 10 days after the initial phase of illness, the late symptoms of HPS appear. These include coughing and shortness of breath, with the sensation of, as one survivor put it, a ""...tight band around my chest and a pillow over my face"" as the lungs fill with fluid.
  
  Is the Disease Fatal?
  
Yes. HPS can be fatal. It has a mortality rate of 38%.)

CDC_0000212_Sec4.txt,"Question: what is the history of hps for Hantavirus ?
URL: http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/
Answer: The ""First""Outbreak
  
In May 1993, an outbreak of an unexplained pulmonary illness occurred in the southwestern United States, in an area shared by Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah known as ""The Four Corners"". A young, physically fit Navajo man suffering from shortness of breath was rushed to a hospital in New Mexico and died very rapidly.
   
  
While reviewing the results of the case, medical personnel discovered that the young man's fiancée had died a few days before after showing similar symptoms, a piece of information that proved key to discovering the disease. As Dr. James Cheek of the Indian Health Service (IHS) noted, ""I think if it hadn't been for that initial pair of people that became sick within a week of each other, we never would have discovered the illness at all"".
  
An investigation combing the entire Four Corners region was launched by the New Mexico Office of Medical Investigations (OMI) to find any other people who had a similar case history. Within a few hours, Dr. Bruce Tempest of IHS, working with OMI, had located five young, healthy people who had all died after acute respiratory failure.
  
A series of laboratory tests had failed to identify any of the deaths as caused by a known disease, such as bubonic plague. At this point, the CDC Special Pathogens Branch was notified. CDC, the state health departments of New Mexico, Colorado and Utah, the Indian Health Service, the Navajo Nation, and the University of New Mexico all joined together to confront the outbreak.
   
  
During the next few weeks, as additional cases of the disease were reported in the Four Corners area, physicians and other scientific experts worked intensively to narrow down the list of possible causes. The particular mixture of symptoms and clinical findings pointed researchers away from possible causes, such as exposure to a herbicide or a new type of influenza, and toward some type of virus. Samples of tissue from patients who had gotten the disease were sent to CDC for exhaustive analysis. Virologists at CDC used several tests, including new methods to pinpoint virus genes at the molecular level, and were able to link the pulmonary syndrome with a virus, in particular a previously unknown type of hantavirus.
  Researchers Launch Investigations to Pin Down the Carrier of the New Virus
   
  
Researchers knew that all other known hantaviruses were transmitted to people by rodents, such as mice and rats. Therefore, an important part of their mission was to trap as many different species of rodents living in the Four Corners region as possible to find the particular type of rodent that carried the virus. From June through mid-August of 1993, all types of rodents were trapped inside and outside homes where people who had hantavirus pulmonary syndrome had lived, as well as in piñon groves and summer sheep camps where they had worked. Additional rodents were trapped for comparison in and around nearby households as well. Taking a calculated risk, researchers decided not to wear protective clothing or masks during the trapping process. ""We didn't want to go in wearing respirators, scaring...everybody"", John Sarisky, an Indian Health Service environmental disease specialist said. However, when the almost 1,700 rodents trapped were dissected to prepare samples for analysis at CDC, protective clothing and respirators were worn.
  
Among rodents trapped, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) was found to be the main host to a previously unknown type of hantavirus. Since the deer mouse often lives near people in rural and semi-rural areas—in barns and outbuildings, woodpiles, and inside people's homes—researchers suspected that the deer mouse might be transmitting the virus to humans. About 30% of the deer mice tested showed evidence of infection with hantavirus. Tests also showed that several other types of rodents were infected, although in lesser numbers.
  
The next step was to pin down the connection between the infected deer mice and households where people who had gotten the disease lived. Therefore, investigators launched a case-control investigation. They compared ""case"" households, where people who had gotten the disease lived, with nearby ""control"" households. Control households were similar to those where the case-patients lived, except for one factor: no one in the control households had gotten the disease.
  
The results? First, investigators trapped more rodents in case households than in control households, so more rodents may have been living in close contact with people in case households. Second, people in case households were more likely than those in control households to do cleaning around the house or to plant in or hand-plow soil outdoors in fields or gardens. However, it was unclear if the risk for contracting HPS was due to performing these tasks, or with entering closed-up rooms or closets to get tools needed for these tasks.
  
In November 1993, the specific hantavirus that caused the Four Corners outbreak was isolated. The Special Pathogens Branch at CDC used tissue from a deer mouse that had been trapped near the New Mexico home of a person who had gotten the disease and grew the virus from it in the laboratory. Shortly afterwards and independently, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) also grew the virus, from a person in New Mexico who had gotten the disease as well as from a mouse trapped in California.
   
  
The new virus was called Muerto Canyon virus — later changed to Sin Nombre virus (SNV) — and the new disease caused by the virus was named hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, or HPS.
  
The isolation of the virus in a matter of months was remarkable. This success was based on close cooperation of all the agencies and individuals involved in investigating the outbreak, years of basic research on other hantaviruses that had been conducted at CDC and USAMRIID, and on the continuing development of modern molecular virologic tests. To put the rapid isolation of the Sin Nombre virus in perspective, it took several decades for the first hantavirus discovered, the Hantaan virus, to be isolated.
  
                
  HPS Not Really a New Disease
  
As part of the effort to locate the source of the virus, researchers located and examined stored samples of lung tissue from people who had died of unexplained lung disease. Some of these samples showed evidence of previous infection with Sin Nombre virus—indicating that the disease had existed before the ""first"" known outbreak—it simply had not been recognized!
  
Other early cases of HPS have been discovered by examining samples of tissue belonging to people who had died of unexplained adult respiratory distress syndrome. By this method, the earliest known case of HPS that has been confirmed has been the case of a 38-year-old Utah man in 1959.
  
Interestingly, while HPS was not known to the epidemiologic and medical communities, there is evidence that it was recognized elsewhere. The Navajo Indians, a number of whom contracted HPS during the 1993 outbreak, recognize a similar disease in their medical traditions, and actually associate its occurrence with mice. As strikingly, Navajo medical beliefs concur with public health recommendations for preventing the disease.
  
                
  Why Did the Outbreak Occur in the Four Corners Area?
  
But why this sudden cluster of cases? The key answer to this question is that, during this period, there were suddenly many more mice than usual. The Four Corners area had been in a drought for several years. Then, in early 1993, heavy snows and rainfall helped drought-stricken plants and animals to revive and grow in larger-than-usual numbers. The area's deer mice had plenty to eat, and as a result they reproduced so rapidly that there were ten times more mice in May 1993 than there had been in May of 1992. With so many mice, it was more likely that mice and humans would come into contact with one another, and thus more likely that the hantavirus carried by the mice would be transmitted to humans.
  
                
  Person-to-Person Spread of HPS Decided Unlikely
  
""Although person-to-person spread [of HPS] has not been documented with any of the other known hantaviruses, we were concerned [during this outbreak] because we were dealing with a new agent"", said Charles Vitek, a CDC medical investigator.
  
Researchers and clinicians investigating the ongoing outbreak were not the only groups concerned about the disease. Shortly after the first few HPS patients died and it became clear that a new disease was affecting people in the area, and that no one knew how it was transmitted, the news media began extensive reporting on the outbreak. Widespread concern among the public ensued.
  
Unfortunately, the first victims of the outbreak were Navajo. News reports focused on this fact, and the misperception grew that the unknown disease was somehow linked to Navajos. As a consequence, Navajos found themselves at the center of intense media attention and the objects of the some people's fears.
  
By later in the summer of 1993, the media frenzy had quieted somewhat, and the source of the disease was pinpointed. Researchers determined that, like other hantaviruses, the virus that causes HPS is not transmitted from person to person the way other infections, such as the common cold, may be. The exception to this is an outbreak of HPS in Argentina in 1996. Evidence from this outbreak suggests that strains of hantaviruses in South America may be transmissable from person to person.
  
To date, no cases of HPS have been reported in the United States in which the virus was transmitted from one person to another. In fact, in a study of health care workers who were exposed to either patients or specimens infected with related types of hantaviruses (which cause a different disease in humans), none of the workers showed evidence of infection or illness.
  
                
  HPS Since the First Outbreak
  
After the initial outbreak, the medical community nationwide was asked to report any cases of illness with symptoms similar to those of HPS that could not be explained by any other cause. As a result, additional cases have been reported.
  
Since 1993, researchers have discovered that there is not just one hantavirus that causes HPS, but several. In June 1993, a Louisiana bridge inspector who had not traveled to the Four Corners area developed HPS. An investigation was begun. The patient's tissues were tested for the presence of antibodies to hantavirus. The results led to the discovery of another hantavirus, named Bayou virus, which was linked to a carrier, the rice rat (Oryzomys palustris). In late 1993, a 33-year-old Florida man came down with HPS symptoms; he later recovered. This person also had not traveled to the Four Corners area. A similar investigation revealed yet another hantavirus, named the Black Creek Canal virus, and its carrier, the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus). Another case occurred in New York. This time, the Sin Nombre-like virus was named New York-1, and the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), was implicated as the carrier.
  
More recently, cases of HPS stemming from related hantaviruses have been documented in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, making HPS a pan-hemispheric disease.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001337.htm
Answer: Q fever is found around the world and is caused by the bacteria Coxiella burnetii. These bacteria can infect:   - Sheep  - Goats  - Cattle  - Dogs  - Cats  - Birds  - Rodents  - Ticks   Infected animals shed these bacteria in:  - Birth products  - Feces  - Milk  - Urine    Humans usually get Q fever by breathing in contaminated droplets released into the air by infected animals. Drinking raw milk has also caused infection in rare cases. People at highest risk for this infection are:  - Farmers  - Laboratory workers who work with Coxiella burnetii  - Sheep and dairy workers  - Veterinarians    People at highest risk include those with heart valve problems or weakened immune systems.)

ADAM_0003314_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Q fever - early ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000611.htm
Answer: Q fever is caused by the bacteria Coxiella burnetii, which live in domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, birds, and cats. Some wild animals and ticks also carry the bacteria.  You can get Q fever by drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk, or afterbreathing indust or droplets in the air that are contaminated with infected animal feces, blood, or birth products.  Symptoms usually develop 2 to 3 weeks after coming in contact with the bacteria. This timeis called the incubation period. Most people have no symptoms. Others may have moderately severe symptoms similar to the flu. If symptoms occur, they may last for several weeks.  People at risk for infection include slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, researchers, food processors, and sheep and cattle workers. Men are infected more often than women. Most people who get Q fever are between 30 and 70 years old.  This disease is occasionally seen in children, especially those who live on a farm. In infected children younger than 3 years old, Q fever is usually discovered while looking for the cause of pneumonia.)

Answer: Rheumatic fever is common in developing countries worldwide. It does not often occur in the United States and other developed countries. When rheumatic fever does occur in the U.S., it is usually in isolated outbreaks. The latest outbreak in the U.S. was in the 1980s.  Rheumatic fever mainly affects children ages 5 -15 who have had strep throat or scarlet fever. If it occurs, it develops about 14 - 28 days after these illnesses.)

ADAM_0004071_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Typhoid fever ? (Also called: Enteric fever)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001332.htm
Answer: S typhi is spread through contaminated food, drink, or water. If you eat or drink something that is contaminated with the bacteria, the bacteria enter your body. They travel into your intestines, and then into your blood. In the blood, they travel to your lymph nodes, gallbladder, liver, spleen, and other parts of the body.  Some people become carriers of S typhi and continue to release the bacteria in their stools for years, spreading the disease.  Typhoid fever is common in developing countries. Fewer than 400 cases are reported in the US each year. Most cases in the US are brought in from other countries where typhoid fever is common.)

Answer: How you describe your symptoms can lead your health care provider to suspect appendicitis.   Your provider will do a physical exam.   - If you have appendicitis, your pain will increase when your lower right belly area is pressed.  - If your appendix has ruptured, touching the belly area may cause a lot of pain and lead you to tighten your muscles.  - A rectal exam may find tenderness on the right side of your rectum.    A blood test will often show a high white blood cell count. Imaging tests may also help diagnose appendicitis. Imaging tests include:  - CT scan of the abdomen  - Ultrasound of the abdomen)

Answer: Most of the time, a surgeon will remove your appendix as soon as you are diagnosed.   If a CT scan shows that you have an abscess, you may be treated with antibiotics first. You will have your appendix removed after the infection and swelling have gone away.  The tests used to diagnose appendicitis are not perfect. As a result, the operation may show that your appendix is normal. In that case, the surgeonwill remove your appendix and explore the rest of your abdomen for other causes of your pain.)

Answer: Summary : Normal body temperature varies by person, age, activity, and time of day. The average normal body temperature is generally accepted as 98.6F (37C). Some studies have shown that the ""normal"" body temperature can have a wide range, from 97F (36.1C) to 99F (37.2C).  A temperature over 100.4F (38C) most often means you have a fever caused by an infection or illness.  Body temperature normally changes throughout the day.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003090.htm
Answer: Normal body temperature may change during any given day. It is usually highest in the evening. Other factors that may affect body temperature are:  - A woman's menstrual cycle. In the second part of this cycle, her temperature may go up by 1 degree or more.  - Physical activity, strong emotion, eating, heavy clothing, medications, high room temperature, and high humidity can all increase body temperature.    Fever is an important part of the body's defense against infection. Most bacteria and viruses that cause infections in people thrive best at 98.6F. Many infants and children develop high fevers with mild viral illnesses. Although a fever signals that a battle might be going on in the body, the fever is fighting for, not against the person.  Brain damage from a fever generally will not occur unless the fever is over 107.6F (42C). Untreated fevers caused by infection will seldom go over 105F unless the child is overdressed or trapped in a hot place.  Febrile seizures do occur in some children. Most febrile seizures are over quickly and do not mean your child has epilepsy. These seizures also do not cause any permanent harm.  Unexplained fevers that continue for days or weeks are called fevers of undetermined origin (FUO).)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003090.htm
Answer: A simple cold or other viral infection can sometimes cause a high fever (102 - 104F, or 38.9 - 40C). This does not usually mean you or your child has a serious problem. Some serious infections may not cause a fever, or may even cause a very low body temperature, especially in infants.  If the fever is mild and you have no other problems, you do not need treatment. Drink fluids and rest.  The illness is probably not serious if your child:  - Is still interested in playing  - Is eating and drinking well  - Is alert and smiling at you  - Has a normal skin color  - Looks well when their temperature comes down    Take steps to lower a fever if you or your child is uncomfortable, vomiting, dried out (dehydrated), or not sleeping well. Remember, the goal is to lower, not eliminate, the fever.  When trying to lower a fever:  - Do not bundle up someone who has the chills.  - Remove excess clothing or blankets. The room should be comfortable, not too hot or cool. Try one layer of lightweight clothing, and one lightweight blanket for sleep. If the room is hot or stuffy, a fan may help.  - A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool someone with a fever. This is especially effective after medication is given -- otherwise the temperature might bounce right back up.  - Donot use cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs. These cool the skin, but often make the situation worse by causing shivering, which raises the core body temperature.    Here are some guidelines for taking medicine to lower a fever:  - Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help reduce fever in children and adults. Sometimes doctors advise you to use both types of medicine.  - Take acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours. It works by turning down the brain's thermostat.  - Take ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours. Do not use ibuprofen in children 6 months or younger.  - Aspirin is very effective for treating fever in adults. Do not give aspirin to a child unless your child's doctor tells you to.  - Know how much you or your child weighs, and then always check the instructions on the package to find the correct dose.  - In children 3 months or younger, call your doctor first before giving medicines.    Eating and drinking:  - Everyone, especially children, should drink plenty of fluids. Water, popsicles, soup, and gelatin are all good choices.  - Do not give too much fruit juice or apple juice and avoid sports drinks in younger children.  - Although eating is fine, do not force foods.)

ADAM_0000301_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the symptoms of Appendicitis ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000256.htm
Answer: The symptoms of appendicitis can vary. It can be hard to diagnose appendicitis in young children, the elderly, and women of childbearing age.  The first symptom is often pain around the belly button. Pain may be minor at first, but becomes more sharp and severe. You may also have a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and a low fever.  The pain tends to move into the right lower part of your belly. The pain tends to focus at a spot directly above the appendix called McBurney's point. This most often occurs 12 to 24 hours after the illness starts.  If your appendix breaks open (ruptures), you may have less pain for a short time and you may feel better. However, the pain soon gets worse and you will feel sicker.  Your pain may be worse when you walk, cough, or make sudden movements. Later symptoms include:  - Chills and shaking  - Hard stools  - Diarrhea  - Fever  - Nausea and vomiting)

MPlusHealthTopics_0000052_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Appendicitis ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/appendicitis.html
Answer: The appendix is a small, tube-like organ attached to the first part of the large intestine. It is located in the lower right part of the abdomen. It has no known function. A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis. The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis.    The main symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side. It is usually sudden and gets worse over time. Other symptoms may include       -  Swelling in the abdomen    -  Loss of appetite    -  Nausea and vomiting    -  Constipation or diarrhea    -  Inability to pass gas    -  Low fever        Not everyone with appendicitis has all these symptoms.    Appendicitis is a medical emergency. Treatment almost always involves removing the appendix. Anyone can get appendicitis, but it is more common among people 10 to 30 years old.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002611.htm
Answer: Summary : Clinitest tablets are used to test how much sugar (glucose) there is in a person's urine. Poisoning occurs from swallowing these tablets.   Clinitest tablets used to be used to check how well a person's diabetes was being controlled. These tablets are rarely used today. They are not meant to be swallowed, but could be taken by accident, since they look like pills.  This article is for information only. Do NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poisonous Ingredient : The poisonous ingredients in Clinitest tablets are:  - Copper sulfate  - Citric acid  - Sodium hydroxide  - Sodium carbonate

Where Found : The poisonous ingredients are found in Clinitest tablets.  Other products may also contain these ingredients.

Symptoms : Symptoms of poisoning from Clinitest tablets are:  - Blood in urine  - Burns and burning pain in the mouth and throat  - Collapse  - Convulsions  - Diarrhea, may be watery or bloody  - Lightheadedness  - Low blood pressure  - No urine output  - Pain during a bowel movement  - Severe abdominal pain  - Throat swelling (causes breathing trouble)  - Vomiting  - Weakness

Home Care : This type of poisoning requires medical help right away.  DO NOT make a person throw up. (They may do so on their own.)  If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.  If the chemical was swallowed, give the person water or orange juice right away. DO NOT give anything to drink if the person is vomiting or has a decreased level of alertness.

Before Calling Emergency : Have this information ready:   - Person's age, weight, and condition   - The name of the product   - When it was swallowed   - The amount swallowed

Poison Control : Your local poison centercan be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room : The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.   The person may receive:  - Additional flushing of the eyes  - Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and ventilator (breathing machine)  - Bronchoscopy. Camera placed down the throat to see burns in the airways and lungs.  - Chest x-ray to see if there is air leakage into the tissue around the heart and lungs  - Endoscopy. Camera placed down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and stomach.  - Fluids through a vein (IV)  - Medicine to treat symptoms and correct the body's electrolyte (body chemical) and acid-base balance

Outlook (Prognosis) : How well someone does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.  Extensive damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach are possible. The ultimate outcome depends on the extent of this damage. Damage continues to occur to the esophagus and stomach for several weeks after the poison was swallowed. Death is possible.  Keep all medicines in child-proof containers and out of the reach of children.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000697.htm
Answer: Summary : Your doctor gave you the news: you have COPD. There is no cure, but there are things you can do every day to keep COPD from getting worse, to protect your lungs, and to stay healthy.

Manage your days : Having COPD can sap your energy. These simple changes can make your days easier and preserve your strength.  - Ask for help when you need it.  - Give yourself more time for daily activities.  - Take breaks to catch your breath when you need to.  - Stay physically and mentally active.  - Set up your house so things you use every day are easily within reach.    Learn how to recognize and manage COPD flare-ups.

Clear the air : Your lungs need clean air. So if you smoke, the best thing you can do for your lungs is quit smoking. Talk with your doctor about ways to quit. Ask about support groups and other stop-smoking strategies.  Even second-hand smoke can cause further damage. So ask other people not to smoke around you.  You should also avoid other forms of pollution like car exhaust and dust. On days when air pollution is high, close the windows and stay inside if you can.

Eat well : Your diet affects COPD in several ways. Food gives you fuel to breathe. Moving air in and out of your lungs takes more work and burns more calories when you have COPD.  Your weight also affects COPD. Being overweight makes it harder to breathe. But if you are too thin, your body will have a hard time fighting illnesses.  Tips for eating well with COPD include:  - Eat small meals and snacks that give you energy, but don't leave you feeling stuffed. Large meals may make it harder for you to breathe.  - Drink water or other liquids throughout the day. Six to eight cups a day is a good goal. Drinking plenty of fluids helps thin mucus so its easier to get rid of it.  - Eat healthy proteins like low-fat milk and cheese, eggs, meat, fish, and nuts.  - Eat healthy fats like olive or canola oils and soft margarine. Ask your doctor how much fat you should eat a day.  - Limit sugary snacks like cakes, cookies, and soda.  - If needed, limit foods like beans, cabbage, and fizzy drinks if they make you feel gassy.    If you need to lose weight:  - Lose weight gradually.  - Replace 3 large meals a day with several smaller meals. That way you wont get too hungry.  - Talk with your doctor about an exercise plan that will help you burn calories.    If you need to gain weight, look for ways to add calories to your meals:  - Add a teaspoon of butter or olive oil to vegetables and soups.  - Stock your kitchen with high-energy snacks like walnuts, almonds, and string cheese.  - Add peanut butter or mayonnaise to your sandwiches.  - Drink milkshakes with high-fat ice cream. Add protein powder for an added boost of calories.

Exercise : Exercise is good for everyone, including people with COPD. Being active can build your strength so you can breathe easier. It can also help you stay healthier for longer.  Talk to your doctor about what kind of exercise is right for you. Then start slow. You may only be able to walk a short distance at first. Over time, you should be able to go longer.  Try to exercise for at least 15 minutes, 3 times a week.  If you become winded, slow down and rest.  Stop exercising and call your doctor if you feel:  - Pain in your chest, neck, arm or jaw  - Sick to your stomach  - Dizzy or lightheaded

Sleep : A good nights sleep can make you feel better and keep you healthier. But when you have COPD, certain things make it harder to get enough rest:  - You might wake up short of breath or coughing.  - Some COPD medicines make it hard to sleep.  - You might have to take a dose of medicine in the middle of the night.    Here are some safe ways to sleep better:  - Let your doctor know you are having trouble sleeping. A change in your treatment might help you sleep.  - Go to bed at the same time every night.  - Do something to relax before you go to bed. You might take a bath or read a book.  - Use window shades to block outside light.  - Ask your family to help keep the house quiet when its time for you to sleep.  - Don't use over-the-counter sleep aids. They can make it harder to breathe.

When to call your doctor : Call your doctor if your breathing is:  - Getting harder  - Faster than before  - Shallow, and you cannot get a deep breath    Also call your doctor if:  - You need to lean forward when sitting in order to breathe easily  - You are using muscles around your ribs to help you breathe  - You are having headaches more often  - You feel sleepy or confused  - You have a fever  - You are coughing up dark mucus  - You are coughing up more mucous than usual  - Your lips, fingertips, or the skin around your fingernails, are blue

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001956.htm
Answer: Summary : Your health care provider may give you a prescription in different ways, including:   - Writing a paper prescription that you take to a local pharmacy  - Calling or e-mailing a pharmacy to order the medicine  - Sending your prescription to the pharmacy by way of a computer that is linked to the provider's electronic medical record (EMR)    You also need to find out if your health plan will pay for the medicine your provider prescribed.   - Certain types or brands of medicine may not be covered.  - Many health plans require you to pay the pharmacy a portion of the cost of the prescription price. This called a co-pay.    Once you get a prescription from your provider, you may buy the medicine in different ways.   LOCAL PHARMACIES   The most common place for filling a prescription is at a local pharmacy. Some pharmacies are located inside of a grocery or large ""chain"" store.   It is best to fill all prescriptions with the same pharmacy. That way, the pharmacy has a record of all the medicines you are taking. This helps prevent drug interactions.   Your health plan may require you to use certain pharmacies. This means they may not pay for your prescription if you do not use one of these pharmacies. To find a pharmacy that takes your health plan:  - Call the phone number on the back of your insurance card.  - Call the pharmacy you want to use to see if they have a contract with your insurance plan.    To help the pharmacist fill the prescription:   - Make sure all of the information is filled in clearly.  - Bring your insurance card the first time you fill the prescription.  - When calling the pharmacy for a refill, make sure to give your name, the prescription number, and the name of the medicine.    MAIL-ORDER PHARMACIES   Some people and insurance companies choose to use mail-order pharmacies.   - The prescription is sent to the mail-order pharmacy or phoned in by the provider.  - Your medicine may cost less when you order it by mail. However, it may take a week or more for the medicine to get to you.  - Mail order is best used for long-term medicines you use for chronic problems.  - Buy short-term medicines and drugs that need to be stored at certain temperatures at a local pharmacy.    INTERNET (ONLINE) PHARMACIES   Internet pharmacies can be used for long-term medicines and medical supplies.   - The website should have clear directions for filling or transferring your prescription.  - Make sure that the website has clearly-stated privacy policies and other procedures.  - AVOID any website that claims a doctor can prescribe the medicine without seeing you.)

ADAM_0003077_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Physical activity (Also called: Fitness recommendations; Exercise)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001941.htm
Answer: Summary : Physical activity -- which includes an active lifestyle and routine exercise -- plus eating well, is the best way to stay healthy.

Information : An effective exercise program needs to be fun and keep you motivated. It helps to have a goal.  Your goal might be to:  - Manage a health condition  - Reduce stress  - Improve your stamina  - Buy clothes in a smaller size    Your exercise program can also be a good way for you to socialize. Taking exercise classes or exercising with a friend are both good ways to be social.  You may have a hard time starting an exercise routine, but once you do start, you may begin to notice other benefits, such as:  - Better control of your weight and appetite  - Improved fitness, making it easier to do everyday activities  - Improved sleep  - More confidence in yourself  - Lower risk for heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure    GETTING STARTED  You do not need to join a gym to exercise. If you have not exercised or been active in a long time, start slowly to prevent injuries. Taking a brisk 10-minute walk twice a week is a good start.  Try joining a dance, yoga, or karate class if it appeals to you. You could also join a baseball or bowling team, or even a mall-walking group. The social aspects of these groups can be rewarding and motivating.  The most important thing is to do exercises that you can maintain and enjoy.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Talk with your health care provider before starting an exercise program if:  - You have diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, or another long-term illness  - You are obese  - You have not been very active lately  - You get chest pains or shortness of breath when you are active    Build physical activity into your regular routine  Simple lifestyle changes can make a big difference over time.  - At work, try taking the stairs instead of the elevator, walking down the hall to talk with a co-worker instead of sending an email, or adding a 10- to 20-minute walk during lunch.  - When you are running errands, try parking at the far end of the parking lot or down the street. Even better, walk to the store or other nearby places.  - At home, do chores such as vacuuming, washing the car, gardening, raking leaves, or shoveling snow.  - If you ride the bus or other public transportation, get off 1 stop before your usual stop and walk the rest of the way.    REDUCE YOUR SCREEN TIME  Sedentary behaviors are things you do while you are sitting still. Decreasing your sedentary behaviors can help you lose weight. For most people, the best way to decrease sedentary behaviors is to reduce the time they spend watching TV and using a computer and other electronic devices. All of these activities are called ""screen time.""  Some ways to decrease screen time are:  - Choose 1 or 2 TV programs to watch, and turn off the TV when they are over.  - Do not keep the TV on all the time for background noise -- you might end up sitting down and watching it. Turn on the radio instead. You can be up doing things around the house and still listen tothe radio.  - Do not eat while you watch TV.  - Take the batteries out of your TV remote control and get up to change the channel.  - Before you turn on the TV, take your dog or a neighbor's dog for a walk. If you are going to miss your favorite show, record it.  - Find activities to replace TV watching. Read a book, play a board game with family or friends, or take an evening cooking class.  - Work out on an exercise or yoga ball while you watch TV. You will burn calories. Or, set up a stationary bike or treadmill in front of your TV and use it while you watch.    If you like playing video games, try games that require you to move your whole body, not just your thumbs.   HOW MUCH EXERCISE DO YOU NEED?  Aim to exercise about 2.5 hours a week. It's important to do both moderate-intensity aerobic activity that increases your heart rate and muscle strengthening. Muscle strengthening, also called strength training, resistance training, or endurance exercise, should be done 2 times a week. Depending on your schedule, you could exercise for 30 minutes 5 days a week, or 45 to 60 minutes 3 days a week.  You do not have to do your total daily exercise all at once. If your goal is to exercise for 30 minutes, you can break that up into shorter time periods that add up to 30 minutes.  As you become more fit, you can challenge yourself by increasing the intensity of your exercise by going from light to moderate activity. You can also increase the amount of time you exercise.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000798.htm
Answer: When a medicine is not taken in the way it is meant to be used and a person is addicted to it, the problem is called prescription drug use disorder. Persons who have this disorder take the drugs because the chemicals in the medicines have psychoactive effects. Psychoactive means having an effect on the way the brain functions. In short, the drugs are used to get high.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000798.htm
Answer: Treatment begins with recognizing there is aproblem. Once you decide you want to do something about your drug use, the next step is to get help and support.  Treatment programs use behavior modification techniques through counseling (talk therapy). The techniques get you to understand your behaviors and why you use drugs. Involving family and friends during counseling can help support you keep you from going back to using (relapsing).  With some drug addictions, such as opioids, medicines may also be used to help reduce the effects of opioids on the brain. Other medicines may be used to lessen cravings and withdrawal symptoms.  If you have severe withdrawal symptoms, you may need to stay at a residential treatment program. There, your health and safety can be monitored as you recover.)

ADAM_0004364_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about 5'-nucleotidase (Also called: 5'-NT)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003575.htm
Answer: Summary : 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) is a protein produced by the liver. A test can be done to measure the amount of this protein in your blood.

How the Test is Performed : Blood is drawn from a vein. Most of the time, a vein on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand is used. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.  Next, the provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm.  Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.  In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.

How to Prepare for the Test : Your provider may tell you to stop taking some medicines that could interfere with the test. Drugs that may affect results include:  - Acetaminophen (Tylenol)  - Halothane  - Isoniazid  - Methyldopa  - Nitrofurantoin

How the Test Will Feel : You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.

Why the Test is Performed : Your doctor may order this test if you have signs of a liver problem. It is used mostly to tell if the high protein level is due to liver damage or skeletal muscle damage.

Normal Results : The normal value is 2 to 17 units per liter.  Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.  The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Greater than normal levels may indicate:  - Cholestasis (when bile, which is made by the liver to help digest fats, is blocked from flowing out of the liver  - Destruction of liver cells  - Hepatitis (liver inflammation)  - Liver ischemia (loss of blood and oxygen to the liver)  - Liver tumor  - Use of a liver-damaging drug

Risks : Slight from having blood drawn may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling light-headed  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  - Bruising)

ADAM_0004365_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about 5-HIAA (Also called: HIAA; 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid; Serotonin metabolite)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003612.htm
Answer: Summary : 5-HIAA is a urine test that measures the amount of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). 5-HIAA is a breakdown product of a hormone called serotonin.  This test tells how much 5-HIAA the body is producing. It is also a way to measure how much serotonin is in the body.

How the Test is Performed : A 24-hour urine sample is needed.  - On day 1, urinate into the toilet when you get up in the morning.  - Afterwards, collect all urine in a special container for the next 24 hours.  - On day 2, urinate into the container when you get up in the morning.    Cap the container. Keep it in the refrigerator or a cool place during the collection period.  Label the container with your name, the date, the time of completion, and return it as instructed.  For an infant, thoroughly wash the area around the urethra. Open a urine collection bag (a plastic bag with an adhesive paper on one end), and place it on the infant. For males, place the entire penis in the bag and attach the adhesive to the skin. For females, place the bag over the labia. Diaper as usual over the secured bag.  This procedure may take a couple of attempts, and lively infants can move the bag, causing the urine to be absorbed by the diaper. Check the infant frequently and change the bag after the infant has urinated into it. Drain the urine from the bag into the container provided by your health care provider.  Deliver it to the laboratory or your provider as soon as possible upon completion.

How to Prepare for the Test : Your provider will instruct you, if necessary, to stop taking medicines that may interfere with the test.  Medicines that can increase 5-HIAA measurements include acetaminophen (Tylenol), acetanilide, phenacetin, glyceryl guaiacolate (found in many cough syrups), methocarbamol, and reserpine.  Medicines that can decrease 5-HIAA measurements include heparin, isoniazid, levodopa, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, methenamine, methyldopa, phenothiazines, and tricyclic antidepressants.  You will be told not to eat certain foods for 3 days before the test. Foods that can interfere with 5-HIAA measurements include plums, pineapples, bananas, eggplant, tomatoes, avocados, and walnuts.

How the Test Will Feel : The test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort.

Why the Test is Performed : This test measures the level of 5-HIAA in the urine. It is often done to detect certain tumors in the digestive tract (carcinoid tumors) and to track a person's condition.  The urine test may also be used to diagnose systemic mastocytosis and some endocrine tumors.

Normal Results : The normal range is 2 to 6 milligrams per 24 hours (mg/24 hr).  Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.  The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may be due to:  - Tumors of the endocrine system or carcinoid tumors  - Systemic mastocytosis   This list is not all-inclusive.

Risks : There are no risks.)

GHR_0000697_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) myasthenia gravis ? (Also called: MG)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/myasthenia-gravis
Answer: Myasthenia gravis is a disorder that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. The weakness most often starts in the muscles around the eyes, causing drooping of the eyelids (ptosis) and difficulty coordinating eye movements, which results in blurred or double vision. In a form of the disorder called ocular myasthenia, the weakness remains confined to the eye muscles. In most people with myasthenia gravis, however, additional muscles in the face and neck are affected. Affected individuals may have unusual facial expressions, difficulty holding up the head, speech impairment (dysarthria), and chewing and swallowing problems (dysphagia) that may lead to choking, gagging, or drooling.  Other muscles in the body are also affected in some people with myasthenia gravis. The muscles of the arms and legs may be involved, causing affected individuals to have changes in their gait or trouble with lifting objects, rising from a seated position, or climbing stairs. The muscle weakness tends to fluctuate over time; it typically worsens with activity and improves with rest.  Weakness of the muscles in the chest wall and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can cause breathing problems in some people with myasthenia gravis. About 10 percent of people with this disorder experience a potentially life-threatening complication in which these respiratory muscles weaken to the point that breathing is dangerously impaired, and the affected individual requires ventilation assistance. This respiratory failure, called a myasthenic crisis, may be triggered by stresses such as infections or reactions to medications.  People can develop myasthenia gravis at any age. For reasons that are unknown, it is most commonly diagnosed in women younger than age 40 and men older than age 60. It is uncommon in children, but some infants born to women with myasthenia gravis show signs and symptoms of the disorder for the first few days or weeks of life. This temporary occurrence of symptoms is called transient neonatal myasthenia gravis.)

GHR_0000697_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to myasthenia gravis ? (Also called: MG)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/myasthenia-gravis
Answer: Researchers believe that variations in particular genes may increase the risk of myasthenia gravis, but the identity of these genes is unknown. Many factors likely contribute to the risk of developing this complex disorder.  Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder, which occurs when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. In myasthenia gravis, the immune system disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles by producing a protein called an antibody that attaches (binds) to proteins important for nerve signal transmission. Antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but the antibody in myasthenia gravis attacks a normal human protein. In most affected individuals, the antibody targets a protein called acetylcholine receptor (AChR); in others, the antibodies attack a related protein called muscle-specific kinase (MuSK). In both cases, the abnormal antibodies lead to a reduction of available AChR.  The AChR protein is critical for signaling between nerve and muscle cells, which is necessary for movement. In myasthenia gravis, because of the abnormal immune response, less AChR is present, which reduces signaling between nerve and muscle cells. These signaling abnormalities lead to decreased muscle movement and the muscle weakness characteristic of this condition.  It is unclear why the immune system malfunctions in people with myasthenia gravis. About 75 percent of affected individuals have an abnormally large and overactive thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone that plays an important role in the immune system. The thymus sometimes develops tumors (thymomas) that are usually noncancerous (benign). However, the relationship between the thymus problems and the specific immune system malfunction that occurs in myasthenia gravis is not well understood.  People with myasthenia gravis are at increased risk of developing other autoimmune disorders, including autoimmune thyroid disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. Gene variations that affect immune system function likely affect the risk of developing myasthenia gravis and other autoimmune disorders.  Some families are affected by an inherited disorder with symptoms similar to those of myasthenia gravis, but in which antibodies to the AChR or MuSK proteins are not present. This condition, which is not an autoimmune disorder, is called congenital myasthenic syndrome.)

MPlusDrugs_0000922_Sec2.txt,"Question: How should Oxybutynin Topical be used and what is the dosage ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a613027.html
Answer: Topical oxybutynin comes as a gel to apply to the skin. It is usually applied once a day. Apply oxybutynin gel at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Apply oxybutynin gel exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Oxybutynin gel may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to use oxybutynin gel even if you feel well. Do not stop using oxybutynin gel without talking to your doctor.  Oxybutynin gel is only for use on the skin. Do not swallow oxybutynin gel and be careful not to get the medication in your eyes. If you get oxybutynin gel in your eyes, wash them with warm, clean water right away. Call your doctor if your eyes become irritated.  You can apply oxybutynin gel anywhere on your shoulders, upper arms, stomach, or thighs. Choose a different area to apply your medication every day, and apply the entire dose to the place you choose. Do not apply oxybutynin gel to your breasts or your genital area. Do not apply the medication to skin that has recently been shaved or that has open sores, rashes, or tattoos.  Keep the area where you applied oxybutynin gel dry for at least 1 hour after you apply the medication. Do not swim, bathe, shower, exercise, or get the area wet during this time. You may apply sunscreen during your treatment with oxybutynin gel.  Oxybutynin gel may catch fire. Stay away from open flames and do not smoke while you are applying the medication and until it is completely dry.  Oxybutynin gel comes in a pump that dispenses measured amounts of the medication and in single dose packets. If you are using the pump, you will have to prime it before the first use. To prime the pump, hold the container upright and press the top down completely 4 times. Do not use any medication that comes out when you are priming the pump. To use oxybutynin gel, follow these steps:   - Wash the area where you plan to apply the medication with mild soap and water. Allow it to dry.  - Wash your hands.  - If you are using the pump, hold the pump upright and press down on the top three times. You can hold the pump so that the medication comes out directly onto the area where you want to apply it, or you can dispense the medication onto your palm and apply it to your chosen area with your fingers.  - If you are using the single dose packets, tear one packet at the notch to open it. Squeeze all of the medication out of the packet. The amount of medication that you squeeze out of the packet should be about the size of a nickel. You can squeeze the medication directly onto the area where you plan to apply it, or you can squeeze it onto your palm and apply it to your chosen area with your fingers. Throw away the empty packet in a trash can that is out of the reach of children.  - Wash your hands again.   Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.)

MPlusDrugs_0000923_Sec2.txt,"Question: How should Oxybutynin Transdermal Patch be used and what is the dosage ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a604016.html
Answer: Transdermal oxybutynin comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is usually applied twice each week (every 34 days). You should apply transdermal oxybutynin on the same 2 days of the week every week. To help you remember to apply your patches on the right days, you should mark the calendar on the back of your package of medication. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use transdermal oxybutynin exactly as directed. Do not apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor.  You can apply oxybutynin patches anywhere on your stomach, hips, or buttocks except the area around your waistline. Choose an area where you think the patch will be comfortable for you, where it will not be rubbed by tight clothing, and where it will be protected from sunlight by clothing. After you apply a patch to a particular area, wait at least 1 week before applying another patch in that spot. Do not apply patches to skin that has wrinkles or folds; that you have recently treated with any lotion, oil, or powder; or that is oily, cut, scraped, or irritated. Before applying a patch, be sure the skin is clean and dry.  After you apply an oxybutynin patch, you should wear it all the time until you are ready to remove it and put on a fresh patch. If the patch loosens or falls off before it is time to replace it, try to press it back in place with your fingers. If the patch cannot be pressed back on, throw it away and apply a fresh patch to a different area. Replace the fresh patch on your next scheduled patch change day.  You may bathe, swim, shower, or exercise while you are wearing an oxybutynin patch. However, try not to rub on the patch during these activities, and do not soak in a hot tub for a long period of time while wearing a patch.  Transdermal oxybutynin controls the symptoms of overactive bladder but does not cure the condition. Continue to take transdermal oxybutynin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking transdermal oxybutynin without talking to your doctor. To use the patches, follow these steps:   - Open the protective pouch and remove the patch.  - Peel the first piece of liner off the sticky side of the patch. A second strip of liner should remain stuck to the patch.  - Press the patch firmly onto your skin with the sticky side down. Be careful not to touch the sticky side with your fingers.  - Bend the patch in half and use your fingertips to roll the remaining part of the patch onto your skin. The second liner strip should fall off of the patch when you do this.  - Press firmly on the surface of the patch to attach it tightly to your skin.  - When you are ready to remove a patch, peel it off slowly and gently. Fold the patch in half with the sticky sides together and throw it away in a trash can that is out of reach of children and pets. Children and pets can be harmed if they chew on, play with, or wear used patches.  - Wash the area that was under the patch with mild soap and warm water to remove any residue. If necessary, you can use baby oil or a medical adhesive removal pad to remove residue that will not come off with soap and water. Do not use alcohol, nail polish remover, or other solvents.  - Apply a new patch to a different area immediately by following steps 15.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/medicareprescriptiondrugcoverage.html
Answer: Summary : Part D is the name of Medicare's prescription drug coverage. It's insurance that helps people pay for prescription drugs. It is available to everyone who has Medicare. It provides protection if you pay high drug costs or have unexpected prescription drug bills. It doesn't cover all costs. You have to pay part of the cost of prescription drugs. Most people also have to pay an additional monthly cost.    Private companies provide Medicare prescription drug coverage. You choose the drug plan you like best. Whether or not you should sign up depends on how good your current coverage is. You need to sign up as soon as you are eligible for Medicare. Otherwise, there may be additional charges.

Answer: If you take a medicine in a way that is different from what the doctor prescribed, it is called prescription drug abuse. It could be       - Taking a medicine that was prescribed for someone else    - Taking a larger dose than you are supposed to    - Taking the medicine in a different way than you are supposed to. This might be crushing tablets and then snorting or injecting them.    - Using the medicine for another purpose, such as getting high       Abusing some prescription drugs can lead to addiction. These include narcotic painkillers, sedatives, tranquilizers, and stimulants.    Every medicine has some risk of side effects. Doctors take this into account when prescribing medicines. People who abuse these drugs may not understand the risks. The medicines may not be safe for them, especially at higher doses or when taken with other medicines.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/794.html
Answer: 5-HTP (5-Hydroxytryptophan) is a chemical by-product of the protein building block L-tryptophan. It is also produced commercially from the seeds of an African plant (Griffonia simplicifolia).     5-HTP is used for sleep disorders, depression, anxiety, migraine and tension-type headaches, fibromyalgia, binge eating associated with obesity, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and along with prescription drugs to treat seizure disorder and Parkinson's disease.)

MPlusHerbsSuppls_0000099_Sec2.txt,"Question: How effective is 5-HTP ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/794.html
Answer: Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.  The effectiveness ratings for 5-HTP are as follows: Possibly effective for...  - Depression. Research shows that taking 5-HTP by mouth might improve symptoms of depression. Several trials have found that doses of 50-3000 mg daily for 2-4 weeks can improve symptoms of depression. Some early research also shows that 5-HTP might be as beneficial as conventional antidepressant therapy.   - Fibromyalgia. Taking 5-HTP by mouth appears to improve symptoms of fibromyalgia including pain severity, morning stiffness, and sleeplessness.  Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...    - Alcoholism. Early research shows that taking 5-HTP with D-phenylalanine and L-glutamine for 40 days can reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms. However, taking 5-HTP with carbidopa daily for one year does not seem to help people stop drinking. The effect of 5-HTP alone for alcoholism is not clear.   - Alzheimer's disease. Early research suggests that taking 5-HTP by mouth does not help symptoms of Alzheimers disease.   - Anxiety. Evidence on the effects of 5-HTP for anxiety is unclear. Taking up to 300 mg of 5-HTP daily along with carbidopa seems to reduce anxiety symptoms in people with anxiety disorders. However, taking 60 mg of 5-HTP daily through the vein does not reduce anxiety in people with panic disorders.   - Nervous system disorder (Cerebellar ataxia). Evidence on the use of 5-HTP for cerebellar ataxia is unclear. Early evidence shows that taking 5 mg/kg of 5-HTP daily for 4 months can decrease nervous system dysfunction. However, other research shows that taking 5-HTP daily for up to one year does not improve symptoms of cerebellar ataxia.   - Down syndrome. Taking 2 mg/kg of 5-HTP daily for 3 years does not improve muscle movement, social skills, or intellectual development in newborn children with Down syndrome.   - Headache. Evidence on the use of 5-HTP to prevent or treat headache symptoms is unclear. Some research shows that taking 5-HTP daily can reduce headache symptoms in children with headaches. However, other studies show that 5-HTP does not reduce the number or severity of headaches.   - Insomnia. Taking an amino acid formula (Gabadone) containing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and 5-HTP seems to help people with sleeping problems fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. The effect of 5-HTP alone on sleeping problems is unclear.   - Menopausal symptoms. Taking 150 mg of 5-HTP daily for 4 weeks does not reduce hot flashes in postmenopausal women.   - Migraine headache. Evidence on the effects of 5-HTP for the prevention or treatment of migraines in adults is unclear. Some studies show that taking 5-HTP daily does not reduce migraines, while other studies show that it might be as beneficial as prescription drugs. 5-HTP does not seem to reduce migraines in children.   - Obesity. Early research suggests that taking 5-HTP might help reduce appetite, caloric intake, and weight in obese people.   - Muscle spasms in the mouth (Palatal myoclonus). Early evidence suggests that taking 5-HTP by mouth might reduce muscle spasms in people with palatal myoclonus.   - Premenstrual syndrome (PMS).   - Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).   - Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).   - Other conditions.   More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of 5-HTP for these uses.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a613027.html
Answer: Topical oxybutynin comes as a gel to apply to the skin. It is usually applied once a day. Apply oxybutynin gel at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Apply oxybutynin gel exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Oxybutynin gel may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to use oxybutynin gel even if you feel well. Do not stop using oxybutynin gel without talking to your doctor.  Oxybutynin gel is only for use on the skin. Do not swallow oxybutynin gel and be careful not to get the medication in your eyes. If you get oxybutynin gel in your eyes, wash them with warm, clean water right away. Call your doctor if your eyes become irritated.  You can apply oxybutynin gel anywhere on your shoulders, upper arms, stomach, or thighs. Choose a different area to apply your medication every day, and apply the entire dose to the place you choose. Do not apply oxybutynin gel to your breasts or your genital area. Do not apply the medication to skin that has recently been shaved or that has open sores, rashes, or tattoos.  Keep the area where you applied oxybutynin gel dry for at least 1 hour after you apply the medication. Do not swim, bathe, shower, exercise, or get the area wet during this time. You may apply sunscreen during your treatment with oxybutynin gel.  Oxybutynin gel may catch fire. Stay away from open flames and do not smoke while you are applying the medication and until it is completely dry.  Oxybutynin gel comes in a pump that dispenses measured amounts of the medication and in single dose packets. If you are using the pump, you will have to prime it before the first use. To prime the pump, hold the container upright and press the top down completely 4 times. Do not use any medication that comes out when you are priming the pump. To use oxybutynin gel, follow these steps:   - Wash the area where you plan to apply the medication with mild soap and water. Allow it to dry.  - Wash your hands.  - If you are using the pump, hold the pump upright and press down on the top three times. You can hold the pump so that the medication comes out directly onto the area where you want to apply it, or you can dispense the medication onto your palm and apply it to your chosen area with your fingers.  - If you are using the single dose packets, tear one packet at the notch to open it. Squeeze all of the medication out of the packet. The amount of medication that you squeeze out of the packet should be about the size of a nickel. You can squeeze the medication directly onto the area where you plan to apply it, or you can squeeze it onto your palm and apply it to your chosen area with your fingers. Throw away the empty packet in a trash can that is out of the reach of children.  - Wash your hands again.   Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.)

MPlusDrugs_0000923_Sec2.txt,"Question: How should Oxybutynin Transdermal Patch be used and what is the dosage ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a604016.html
Answer: Transdermal oxybutynin comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is usually applied twice each week (every 34 days). You should apply transdermal oxybutynin on the same 2 days of the week every week. To help you remember to apply your patches on the right days, you should mark the calendar on the back of your package of medication. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use transdermal oxybutynin exactly as directed. Do not apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor.  You can apply oxybutynin patches anywhere on your stomach, hips, or buttocks except the area around your waistline. Choose an area where you think the patch will be comfortable for you, where it will not be rubbed by tight clothing, and where it will be protected from sunlight by clothing. After you apply a patch to a particular area, wait at least 1 week before applying another patch in that spot. Do not apply patches to skin that has wrinkles or folds; that you have recently treated with any lotion, oil, or powder; or that is oily, cut, scraped, or irritated. Before applying a patch, be sure the skin is clean and dry.  After you apply an oxybutynin patch, you should wear it all the time until you are ready to remove it and put on a fresh patch. If the patch loosens or falls off before it is time to replace it, try to press it back in place with your fingers. If the patch cannot be pressed back on, throw it away and apply a fresh patch to a different area. Replace the fresh patch on your next scheduled patch change day.  You may bathe, swim, shower, or exercise while you are wearing an oxybutynin patch. However, try not to rub on the patch during these activities, and do not soak in a hot tub for a long period of time while wearing a patch.  Transdermal oxybutynin controls the symptoms of overactive bladder but does not cure the condition. Continue to take transdermal oxybutynin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking transdermal oxybutynin without talking to your doctor. To use the patches, follow these steps:   - Open the protective pouch and remove the patch.  - Peel the first piece of liner off the sticky side of the patch. A second strip of liner should remain stuck to the patch.  - Press the patch firmly onto your skin with the sticky side down. Be careful not to touch the sticky side with your fingers.  - Bend the patch in half and use your fingertips to roll the remaining part of the patch onto your skin. The second liner strip should fall off of the patch when you do this.  - Press firmly on the surface of the patch to attach it tightly to your skin.  - When you are ready to remove a patch, peel it off slowly and gently. Fold the patch in half with the sticky sides together and throw it away in a trash can that is out of reach of children and pets. Children and pets can be harmed if they chew on, play with, or wear used patches.  - Wash the area that was under the patch with mild soap and warm water to remove any residue. If necessary, you can use baby oil or a medical adhesive removal pad to remove residue that will not come off with soap and water. Do not use alcohol, nail polish remover, or other solvents.  - Apply a new patch to a different area immediately by following steps 15.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682141.html
Answer: Oxybutynin comes as a tablet, a syrup, and an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The tablets and syrup are usually taken two to four times a day. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take oxybutynin at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take oxybutynin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Swallow the extended-release tablets whole with plenty of water or other liquid. Do not split, chew, or crush the extended-release tablets. Tell your doctor if you cannot swallow tablets.  Use a dose-measuring spoon or cup to measure the correct amount of liquid for each dose, not a household spoon.  Your doctor may start you on a low dose of oxybutynin and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every week.  Oxybutynin may control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to take oxybutynin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking oxybutynin without talking to your doctor.  You may notice some improvement in your symptoms within the first 2 weeks of your treatment. However, it may take 68 weeks to experience the full benefit of oxybutynin. Talk to your doctor if your symptoms do not improve at all within 8 weeks.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003075.htm
Answer: Shortness of breath has many different causes. For example, heart disease can cause breathlessness if your heart is unable to pump enough blood to supply oxygen to your body. If your brain, muscles, or other body organs do not get enough oxygen, a sense of breathlessness may occur.  Breathing difficulty may also be due to problems with the lungs, airways, or other health problems.  Problems with the lungs:  - Blood clot in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary embolism)  - Bronchiolitis  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as chronic bronchitis or emphysema  - Other lung disease  - Pneumonia  - Pulmonary hypertension    Problems with the airways leading to the lungs:  - Blockage of the air passages in your nose, mouth, or throat  - Choking on something stuck in the airways  - Croup  - Epiglottitis   Problems with the heart:  - Angina  - Heart attack  - Heart defects from birth (congenital heart disease)  - Heart failure  - Heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias)    Other causes:  - Allergies (such as to mold, dander, or pollen)  - High altitudes where there is less oxygen in the air  - Compression of the chest wall  - Dust in the environment  - Emotional distress, such as anxiety  - Hiatal hernia  - Obesity  - Panic attacks)

Answer: Sometimes, mild breathing difficulty may be normal and is not a cause for concern. A very stuffy nose is one example. Strenuous exercise, especially when you do not exercise often, is another example.  If breathing difficulty is new or is getting worse, it may be due to a serious problem. Though many causes are not dangerous and are easily treated, call your health care provider for any breathing difficulty.  If you are being treated for a long-term problem with your lungs or heart, follow your provider's directions to help with that problem.)

ADAM_0003102_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Placenta abruptio (Also called: Premature placental separation; Placental separation; Placental abruption)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000605.htm
Answer: Summary : The placenta connects the fetus (unborn baby) to the mother's uterus. It allows the baby to get nutrients, blood, and oxygen from the mother. It also helps the baby get rid of waste.  Placenta abruptio (also called placental abruption) is when the placenta separates from the inner wall of the uterus before the baby is born.

More About This Condition : In most pregnancies, the placenta stays attached to the upper part of the uterine wall.  In a small number of pregnancies, the placenta detaches (pulls itself from the wall of the uterus) too early. Most of the time, only part of the placenta pulls away. Other times it pulls away completely. If this happens, it is usually in the 3rd trimester.  The placenta is the lifeline of a fetus. Serious problems occur if it detaches. The baby gets less oxygen and fewer nutrients. Some babies become growth restricted (very small), and in a small number of cases, it is fatal. It can also cause significant blood loss for the mother.

What Causes It? : No one knows what causes placental abruption. But these factors raise a woman's risk for it:  - Long-term (chronic) high blood pressure  - Sudden high blood pressure in pregnant women who had normal blood pressure in the past  - Heart disease  - Diabetes  - Smoking  - Alcohol or cocaine use  - Placental abruption in an earlier pregnancy  - An injury to the mother (such as a car crash or fall in which the abdomen was hit)  - Being African American  - Being older than 40

Signs of Placental Abruption : The most common symptoms are vaginal bleeding and painful contractions. The amount of bleeding depends on how much of the placenta has detached. Sometimes the blood that collects when the placenta detaches stays between the placenta and uterine wall, so you may not have bleeding from your vagina.  - If the separation is slight, you may have only light bleeding. You may also have cramps or feel tender in your belly.  - If the separation is moderate, you may have heavier bleeding. Cramps and belly pain will be more severe.  - If more than half the placenta detaches, you may have belly pain and heavy bleeding. You may also have contractions. The baby may move more or less than normal.   If you have any of these symptoms during your pregnancy, tell your health care provider right away.

How Is Placental Abruption Treated? : Your provider will:  - Do a physical exam  - Observe your contractions and how your baby responds to them  - Sometimes do an ultrasound to check your placenta (but ultrasound does not always show a placental abruption)  - Check your baby's heart rate and rhythm    If your placental abruption is small, your provider may put you on bed rest to stop your bleeding. After a few days, most women can usually go back to their normal activities.  For a moderate separation, you will likely need to stay in the hospital. In the hospital:  - Your baby's heart rate will be monitored.  - You might need a blood transfusion.  - If your baby shows any signs of distress, your health care provider may induce your labor early. If you cannot give birth vaginally, you will need a cesarean delivery (C-section).    Severe placental abruption is an emergency. You will need to deliver right away, usually by C-section. It is very rare, but a baby can be stillborn if there is a severe abruption.

Can I Prevent Placental Abruption? : You cannot prevent placental abruption, but you can control the risk factors related to it by:  - Keeping high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes under control  - Not using tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, or amphetamines  - Following your provider's recommendations about ways to lower your risk if you had an abruption in a past pregnancy

Answer: Separation anxiety in children is a developmental stage during which the child experiences anxiety when separated from the primary caregiver (usually the mother).) 
"
ADAM_0003523_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Separation anxiety in children ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001542.htm
Answer: As infants develop, they experience various emotions, usually in a predictable order. Before 8 months, infants are so new to the world that they have little knowledge of what is ordinary and what may be dangerous, so new situations or experiences seem usual, and not frightening.  In normal development, during this early period the infant becomes familiar with the home environment, and feels comfortable when parents or other known caretakers are present. After this time, lack of familiarity often produces fear because the infant recognizes that something unusual is going on.  From 8to 14 months, children often become frightened when they meet new people or visit new places. They recognize their parents as familiar and safe. When separated from their parents, particularly when away from home, they feel threatened and unsafe.  Separation anxiety is a normal developmental stage. It helped keep our ancestors alive and helps children learn how to master their environment.  It usually ends when the child is around 2 years old. At this age, toddlers begin to understand that parents may be out of sight now, but will return later. There is also a normal desire to test their independence.  To get over separation anxiety, children must:  - Feel safe in their home environment  - Trust people other than their parents  - Trust that their parents will return   Even after children have successfully mastered this developmental stage, separation anxiety may return during periods of stress. Most children will experience some degree of separation anxiety when in unfamiliar situations, especially when separated from their parents.  When children are in situations (such as hospitals) and are experiencing stress (such as illness or pain), they seek the safety, comfort, and protection of their parents. When parents cannot be with their children in these situations, the children experience distress.  This is why it is important to stay with your child as much as is possible during any medical procedures. Your presence can actually reduce the amount of pain the child experiences, as anxiety of any kind makes pain worse.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000562.htm
Answer: Shoulder separation is not an injury to the main shoulder joint itself. It is an injury to the top of the shoulder where the collarbone (clavicle) meets the top of the shoulder blade (acromion of the scapula).  It is not the same as a shoulder dislocation. A dislocated shoulder occurs when the arm bone comes out of the main shoulder joint.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000562.htm
Answer: Most shoulder separation injuries are caused by falling onto the shoulder. This causes a tear in the tissue that connects the collarbone and top of the shoulder blade. These tears can also come from car accidents and sports injuries.  This injury can make the shoulder look abnormal, from the end of a bone sticking up or the shoulder hanging lower than normal.   Pain is usually at the very top of the shoulder.   Your health care provider may have you hold onto a weight while he or she examines you to see if your collarbone sticks out. An x-ray of your shoulder may help diagnose a shoulder separation.)

Answer: Most people recover from a shoulder separation without surgery, within 2 to 12 weeks. You will be treated with ice, medicines, a sling, and then exercises as you continue to heal.  Your recovery may be slower if you have:   - Arthritis in your shoulder joint  - Damaged cartilage (cushioning tissue) between your collarbone and top of your shoulder blade  - A severe shoulder separation    You may need surgery right away if you have:   - Numbness in your fingers  - Cold fingers  - Muscle weakness in your arm  - Severe deformity of the joint)

ADAM_0003797_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Sutures - separated (Also called: Separation of the sutures)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003307.htm
Answer: Summary : Separated sutures are abnormally wide spaces in the bony joints of the skull in an infant.

Considerations : The skull of an infant or young child is made up of bony plates that allow for growth. The borders where these plates come together are called sutures or suture lines.  In an infant only a few minutes old, the pressure from delivery may compress the head. This makes the bony plates overlap at the sutures and creates a small ridge. This is normal in newborns. In the next few days the baby's head expands. The overlap disappears and disappears and the edges of the bony plates meet edge to edge. This is the normal position.  Diseases or conditions that cause an abnormal increase in the pressure within the head can cause the sutures to spread apart. These separated sutures can be a sign of pressure within the skull (increased intracranial pressure).  Separated sutures may be associated with bulging fontanelles. If intracranial pressure is increased a lot, there may be large veins over the scalp.

Causes : The problem may be caused by:  - Arnold-Chiari malformation  - Battered child syndrome  - Bleeding inside the brain (intraventricular hemorrhage)  - Brain tumor  - Certain vitamin deficiencies  - Dandy-Walker malformation  - Down syndrome  - Hydrocephalus  - Infections that are present at birth (congenital infections)  - Lead poisoning  - Meningitis  - Subdural hematoma or subdural effusion  - Underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Contact your health care provider if your child has:  - Separated sutures, bulging fontanelles, or very obvious scalp veins  - Redness, swelling, or discharge from the area of the sutures

What to Expect at Your Office Visit : The provider will perform a physical exam. This will include examining the fontanelles and scalp veins and feeling (palpating) the sutures to find out how far they are separated.  The provider will ask questions about the child's medical history and symptoms, including:  - Does the child have other symptoms (such as abnormal head circumference)?  - When did you first notice the separated sutures?  - Does it seem to be getting worse?  - Is the child otherwise well? (For example, are eating and activity patterns normal?)    The following tests may be performed:  - MRI of the head  - CT scan of the head  - Ultrasound of the head  - Infectious disease work-up, including blood cultures and possible spinal tap  - Metabolic work-up, such as blood tests to look at electrolyte levels  - Standard eye exam   Although your provider keeps records from routine checkups, you might find it helpful to keep your own records of your child's development. Bring these records to your provider's attention if you notice anything unusual.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a694007.html
Answer: Gabapentin capsules, tablets, and oral solution are used to help control certain types of seizures in people who have epilepsy. Gabapentin capsules, tablets, and oral solution are also used to relieve the pain of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN; the burning, stabbing pain or aches that may last for months or years after an attack of shingles). Gabapentin extended-release tablets (Horizant) are used to treat restless legs syndrome (RLS; a condition that causes discomfort in the legs and a strong urge to move the legs, especially at night and when sitting or lying down). Gabapentin is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. Gabapentin treats seizures by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain. Gabapentin relieves the pain of PHN by changing the way the body senses pain. It is not known exactly how gabapentin works to treat restless legs syndrome.)

MPlusDrugs_0000541_Sec2.txt,"Question: How should Gabapentin be used and what is the dosage ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a694007.html
Answer: Gabapentin comes as a capsule, a tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and an oral solution (liquid) to take by mouth. Gabapentin capsules, tablets, and oral solution are usually taken with a full glass of water (8 ounces [240 milliliters]), with or without food, three times a day.  These medications should be taken at evenly spaced times throughout the day and night; no more than 12 hours should pass between doses. The extended-release tablet (Horizant) is taken with food once daily at about 5 PM. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take gabapentin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Gabapentin extended-release tablets cannot be substituted for another type of gabapentin product. Be sure that you receive only the type of gabapentin that was prescribed by your doctor. Ask your pharmacist if you have any questions about the type of gabapentin you were given.  Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not cut, chew, or crush them.  If your doctor tells you to take one-half of a regular tablet as part of your dose, carefully split the tablet along the score mark. Use the other half-tablet as part of your next dose. Properly throw away any half-tablets that you have not used within several days of breaking them.  If you are taking gabapentin to control seizures or PHN, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of gabapentin and gradually increase your dose as needed to treat your condition. If you are taking gabapentin to treat PHN, tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during your treatment.  Gabapentin may help to control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take gabapentin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking gabapentin without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking gabapentin tablets, capsules, or oral solution, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, nausea, pain, and sweating. If you are taking gabapentin to treat seizures and you suddenly stop taking the medication, you may experience seizures more often. Your doctor may decrease your dose gradually over at least a week.  Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with gabapentin and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a694007.html
Answer: Before taking gabapentin,  - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to gabapentin, any other medications, or any of the inactive ingredients in the type of gabapentin you plan to take. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the inactive ingredients.  - you should know that gabapentin is available in different forms that may be prescribed for different uses. Ask your doctor to be sure that you are not taking more than one product that contains gabapentin.  - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: hydrocodone (in Hydrocet, in Vicodin, others), medications that make you feel dizzy or drowsy, morphine (Avinza, Kadian, MSIR, others), and naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox, Naprosyn, others). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.  - if you are taking antacids such as Maalox or Mylanta, take them at least 2 hours before you take gabapentin tablets, capsules, or solution.  - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney disease. If you will be taking the extended-release tablets, also tell your doctor if you need to sleep during the day and stay awake at night.  - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking gabapentin, call your doctor.  - if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking gabapentin.  - you should know that this medication may make you drowsy or dizzy, may slow your thinking, and may cause loss of coordination. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you, and your doctor agrees that it is safe for you to begin these activities.  - if you are giving gabapentin to your child, you should know that your child's behavior and mental abilities may change while he or she is taking gabapentin. Your child may have sudden changes in mood, become hostile or hyperactive, have difficulty concentrating or paying attention, or be drowsy or clumsy. Have your child avoid activities that could be dangerous, such as riding a bicycle, until you know how gabapentin affects him or her.  - remember that alcohol can add to the drowsiness caused by this medication.  - you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking gabapentin for the treatment of epilepsy, mental illness, or other conditions. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants such as gabapentin to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as one week after they started taking the medication. There is a risk that you may experience changes in your mental health if you take an anticonvulsant medication such as gabapentin, but there may also be a risk that you will experience changes in your mental health if your condition is not treated. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood); talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life; withdrawing from friends and family; preoccupation with death and dying; giving away prized possessions; or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a614045.html
Answer: Hydrocodone is used to relieve severe pain. Hydrocodone is only used to treat people who are expected to need medication to relieve severe pain around-the-clock for a long time and who cannot be treated with other medications or treatments. Hydrocodone extended-release (long-acting) capsules or extended-release tablets should not be used to treat pain that can be controlled by medication that is taken as needed. Hydrocodone is in a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics. It works by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain.  This monograph only includes information about the use of hydrocodone alone. If you are taking a hydrocodone combination product, be sure to read information about all the ingredients in the hydrocodone-combination monograph and ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.)

Answer: Hydrocodone comes as an extended-release (long-acting) capsule and an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The extended-release capsule is usually taken once every 12 hours. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once daily. Take hydrocodone at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take hydrocodone exactly as directed by your doctor.  Swallow the extended-release capsules or extended-release tablets one at a time with plenty of water. Swallow each capsule or tablet as soon as you put it in your mouth. Do not presoak, wet, or lick the extended-release tablets before you put them in your mouth.  Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of hydrocodone and may gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 3 to 7 days if needed to control your pain. After your take hydrocodone for a period of time, your body may become used to the medication. If this happens, your doctor may increase your dose of hydrocodone or may prescribe a different medication to help control your pain. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment with hydrocodone.  Do not stop taking hydrocodone without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking hydrocodone, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, teary eyes, runny nose, yawning, sweating, chills, hair standing on end, muscle pain, widened pupils (black circles in the middle of the eyes), irritability, anxiety, back or joint pain, weakness, stomach cramps, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, fast breathing, or fast heartbeat.

Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you, and your doctor agrees that it is safe for you to begin these activities.  - if you are giving gabapentin to your child, you should know that your child's behavior and mental abilities may change while he or she is taking gabapentin. Your child may have sudden changes in mood, become hostile or hyperactive, have difficulty concentrating or paying attention, or be drowsy or clumsy. Have your child avoid activities that could be dangerous, such as riding a bicycle, until you know how gabapentin affects him or her.  - remember that alcohol can add to the drowsiness caused by this medication.  - you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking gabapentin for the treatment of epilepsy, mental illness, or other conditions. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants such as gabapentin to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as one week after they started taking the medication. There is a risk that you may experience changes in your mental health if you take an anticonvulsant medication such as gabapentin, but there may also be a risk that you will experience changes in your mental health if your condition is not treated. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood); talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life; withdrawing from friends and family; preoccupation with death and dying; giving away prized possessions; or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.)

MPlusDrugs_0000583_Sec1.txt,"Question: What important warning or information should I know about Hydrocodone ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a614045.html
Answer: Hydrocodone may be habit-forming. Do not take more of it, take it more often, or take it in a different way than directed by your doctor. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family drinks or has ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, uses or has ever used street drugs, has overused prescription medications, or if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness. There is a greater risk that you will overuse hydrocodone if you have or have ever had any of these conditions.  Do not allow anyone else to take your medication. Hydrocodone may harm or cause death to other people who take your medication, especially children. Keep hydrocodone in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Be especially careful to keep hydrocodone out of the reach of children. Keep track of how many capsules or tablets are left so you will know if any medication is missing.  Hydrocodone may cause slowed or stopped breathing, especially when you begin your treatment and any time your dose is increased. Your doctor will monitor you carefully during your treatment. Your doctor will adjust your dose to control your pain and decrease the risk that you will experience serious breathing problems. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had slowed breathing or asthma. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take hydrocodone. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways), a head injury, or any condition that increases the amount of pressure in your brain. The risk that you will develop breathing problems may be higher if you are an older adult or are weakened or malnourished due to disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: slowed breathing, long pauses between breaths, or shortness of breath.  Drinking alcohol, taking prescription or nonprescription medications that contain alcohol, or using street drugs during your treatment with hydrocodone increases the risk that you will experience breathing problems or other serious, life-threatening side effects. It is especially important that you do not drink any drinks that contain alcohol or take any prescription or non-prescription medications that contain alcohol during your treatment with hydrocodone extended-release capsules and extended-release tablets. Talk to your doctor about the risks of drinking alcohol or using street drugs during your treatment with hydrocodone products.  Taking certain other medications or stopping treatment with certain other medications while you are taking hydrocodone may increase the risk that you will experience breathing problems or other serious, life-threatening side effects. Tell your doctor if you are taking, plan to take or plan to stop taking any of the following medications: certain antifungal medications including itraconazole (Onmel, Sporanox), ketoconazole (Extina, Nizoral, Xolegel), and voriconazole (Vfend); carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Equetro, Tegretol, others); cimetidine; clarithromycin (Biaxin, in Prevpac); erythromycin (E.E.S., Erythyrocin, others); other narcotic pain medications; medications for anxiety, seizures, mental illness, or nausea; certain medications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) including ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra, in Viekira Pak); muscle relaxants; phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek); rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane, in Rifamate, in Rifater); sedatives; sleeping pills; or tranquilizers.  Swallow hydrocodone extended-release capsules or extended-release tablets whole; do not chew, break, divide, crush, or dissolve them. Hydrocodone extended-release capsules and extended-release tablets are difficult to crush, break or dissolve. If you swallow broken, chewed, or crushed extended-release capsules or extended-release tablets, you may receive too much hydrocodone at once. This may cause serious problems, including overdose and death.  Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you take hydrocodone regularly during your pregnancy, your baby may experience life-threatening withdrawal symptoms after birth. Tell your baby's doctor right away if your baby experiences any of the following symptoms: irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep, high-pitched cry, uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body, vomiting, diarrhea, or failure to gain weight.  Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with hydrocodone and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.  Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking hydrocodone.)

Your doctor may tell you not to take hydrocodone.  - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had low blood pressure, difficulty urinating, seizures, or thyroid, gall bladder, pancreas, liver, or kidney disease. If you are taking the extended-release tablets, also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had difficulty swallowing, colon cancer (cancer that begins in the large intestine), esophageal cancer (cancer that begins in the tube that connects the mouth and stomach), heart failure (HF; condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to other parts of the body), or heart rhythm problems such long QT syndrome (condition that increases the risk of developing an irregular heartbeat that may cause fainting or sudden death).  - tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding.  - if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking hydrocodone.  - you should know that hydrocodone may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.  - you should know that hydrocodone may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is more common when you first start taking hydrocodone. To avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up.  - you should know that hydrocodone may cause constipation. Talk to your doctor about changing your diet and using other medications to treat or prevent constipation.)

Answer: Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.  The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. The person may be admitted to the hospital and may receive:  - Activated charcoal  - Blood and urine tests  - Breathing support,including oxygen and a tube through the mouth into the lungs  - Chest x-ray  - CT scan (advanced imaging) of the brain  - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)  - Intravenous fluids (through a vein)  - A laxative  - Medicine to reverse the effects of the poison and treat symptoms  - Tube through the mouth into the stomach to empty the stomach (gastric lavage)   If there is a high level of acetaminophen in the blood, the person will be given N-acetyl cysteine. This drug is called an antidote. It counteracts the effects of the acetaminophen. Without it, deadly liver failure may occur.)

Answer: How well a person does, depends on the amount of medicine swallowed and how quickly the treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. If breathing has been depressed for a long period of time before treatment, brain injury may occur.  If an antidote can be given, recovery from an acute overdose often occurs within 24 to 48 hours. Recovery takes longer, if the liver is affected, and the person may not fully recover.)

ADAM_0000140_Sec2.txt,"Question: What is (are) Alcohol use and safe drinking ? (Also called: Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001944.htm
Answer: Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.  TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50 -- coma  - 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death    You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.  HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL  Alcohol increases the risk of:  - Alcoholism  - Falls, drownings, and other accidents  - Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers  - Motor vehicle accidents  - Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  - Suicide and homicide    Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.  RESPONSIBLE DRINKING  If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.  Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:  - Never drink alcohol and drive a car.  - If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.  - Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.    If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.  If alcohol use runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.  CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:  - You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member  - You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use or support groups  - You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking    Other resources include:  - Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups  - Local hospitals  - Public or private mental health agencies  - School or work counselors  - Student or employee health centers)

ADAM_0003451_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Safe eating during cancer treatment
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000061.htm
Answer: Summary : When you have cancer, you need good nutrition to help keep your body strong. To do this you need to watch the foods you eat and how you prepare them.  Some raw foods can contain germs that can hurt you when cancer or treatment weakens your immune system. Ask your doctor or nurse about how to eat well but safely.  When you eat eggs:  - Yolks and whites should be cooked solid. Do not eat runny eggs.  - Do not eat foods that may have raw eggs in them (such as Caesar salad dressing, cookie dough, cake batter, and hollandaise sauce).    Be careful when you have dairy products:  - All milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy should have the word pasteurized on their containers.  - Do not eat soft cheeses or cheeses with blue veins (such as Brie, Camembert, Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola, and Bleu).  - Do not eat Mexican-style cheeses (such as queso blanco fresco and cojita).    Fruits and vegetables:  - Wash all raw fruits, vegetables, and fresh herbs with cold running water.  - Do not eat raw vegetable sprouts (such as alfalfa and mung bean).  - Do not use fresh salsa or salad dressings that are kept in the refrigerated cases of the grocery store.  - Drink only juice that says pasteurized on the container.    Do not eat raw honey. Eat only heat-treated honey. Avoid sweets that have creamy fillings.

Cook foods safely : When you cook, make sure you cook your food long enough.  Do not eat uncooked tofu. Cook tofu for at least 5 minutes.  When eating chicken and other poultry:  - Cook whole pieces of poultry to 180 F.  - Cook ground poultry to 165 F.    If you cook beef, lamb, pork, or venison:  - Do not eat raw mean, such as Japanese sashimi.  - Make sure meat is not red or pink before you eat it.  - Cook meat to 160 F.    When eating fish, oysters, and other shellfish:  - Do not eat raw fish (such as sushi), raw oysters, or any other raw shellfish.  - Make sure all fish and shellfish you eat is cooked thoroughly.    Heat all casseroles to 165 F. Warm hot dogs and lunch meats to steaming before you eat them.

Be careful when you eat out : When you dine out, stay away from:  - Raw fruits and vegetables  - Salad bars, buffets, sidewalk vendors, potlucks, and delis    Ask if all fruit juices are pasteurized.  Use only salad dressings, sauces, and salsas from single-serving packages. Eat out at times when restaurants are less crowded. Always ask for your food to be prepared fresh, even at fast food restaurants.)

ADAM_0003452_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Safe sex
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001949.htm
Answer: Summary : Safe sex means taking steps before and during sex that can prevent you from getting an infection, or from giving an infection to your partner.

Information : A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that can be spread to another person through sexual contact. STIs include:  - Chlamydia  - Genital herpes  - Genital warts  - Gonorrhea  - Hepatitis  - HIV  - HPV  - Syphilis    STIs are also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  These infections are spread by direct contact with a sore on the genitals or mouth, body fluids, or sometimes the skin around the genital area.  Before having sex:  - Get to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories  - Don't feel forced into having sex  - Don't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner    Your sexual partner should be someone who you know does not have any STI. Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs and share the test results with each other.  If you know you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know this before you have sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.  Use condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.  - The condom should be in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.  - Keep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with skin areas around the genitals. A condom reduces but does not eliminate your risk of getting an STI.    Other tips include:   - Use lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.  - Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.  - Polyurethane condoms are less likely to break than latex condoms, but they cost more.  - Using condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may increase the chance of HIV transmission.  - Stay sober. Alcohol and drugs impair your judgment. When you are not sober, you might not choose your partner as carefully. You may also forget to use condoms, or use them incorrectly.    Get tested regularly for STIs if you have new sexual partners. Most STIs have no symptoms, so you need to be tested often if there is any chance you have been exposed. You will have the best outcome and will be less likely to spread the infection if you are diagnosed early.  Women should consider getting the HPV vaccine to keep from getting the human papillomavirus. This virus can put you at risk for vaginal warts and cervical cancer.)

ADAM_0003842_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Taking multiple medicines safely
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000883.htm
Answer: Summary : If you take more than one medicine, it is important to take them carefully and safely. Some medicines can interact and cause side effects. It can also be hard to keep track of when and how to take each medicine.  Here are tips to help you keep track of your medicines and take them as directed.

Why you may Need More Than one Medicine : You may take more than one medicine to treat a single condition. Or you may take different medicines to treat more than one health problem. For example, you may take a statin to lower your cholesterol, and a beta-blocker to control your blood pressure.   Older adults often have more than one health condition. So they are more likely to take several medicines.

Risks of Taking Multiple Medicines : The more medicines you take, the more you need to use them carefully. There are several risks when taking multiple medicines.  - You may be more likely to have side effects. Because most medicines can have side effects, the more medicines you take, the more likely you will have side effects. Taking certain medicines can also increase the risk of falls.  - You are at higher risk for drug interactions. An interaction is when one medicine affects how another medicine works. For example, taken together, one medicine may make the other medicine stronger. Medicines can also interact with alcohol and even some foods. Some interactions can be serious, even life threatening.  - You may find it hard to keep track of when to take each medicine. You even may forget which medicine you have taken at a certain time.  - You may take a medicine you do not need. This may be more likely to happen if you see more than one health care provider. You may be prescribed different medicines for the same problem.

People at Higher Risk : Certain people are more likely to have problems from taking multiple medicines:  - People who are prescribed 5 or more medicines. The more medicines you take, the higher the chance of interactions or side effects. You may also find it hard to remember all possible drug interactions.  - People who take medicines prescribed by more than one provider. One provider may not know that you are taking medicines another provider has given you.  - Older adults. As you age, your body processes medicines differently. For instance, your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. This can mean that more medicine stays in your body for longer. This can lead to dangerous levels of medicines in your system.  - People in the hospital. When you are in the hospital, you will likely see new providers who are not familiar with your health history. Without this knowledge, they may prescribe a medicine that may interact with medicines you already take.

What you can do : These suggestions can help you take all of your medicines safely:  - Keep a list of all medicines you take. Your list should include all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. OTC medicines include vitamins, supplements, and herbal products. Keep a copy of the list in your wallet and at home.  - Review your medicine list with your health care providers and pharmacists. Discuss the list with your provider each time you have an appointment. Ask your provider if you still need to take all of the medicines on your list. Also ask if any of the dosages should be changed. Make sure you give all of your providers a copy of your medicine list.  - Ask questions about any new drugs you are prescribed. Make sure you understand how to take them. Also ask if a new medicine could interact with any of the medicines or supplements you are already taking.  - Take your medicines exactly as your provider tells you. If you have questions about how or why to take your medicine, ask your provider. DO NOT skip doses, or stop taking your medicines.  - If you notice side effects, tell your health care provider. DO NOT stop taking your medicines unless your provider tells you to.  - Keep your medicines organized. There are many ways to keep track of your medicines. A pill organizer may help. Try one or more methods and see what works for you.  - If you have a hospital stay, bring your medicine list with you. Talk with your provider about medicine safety while you are in the hospital.

When to Call the Doctor : Call if you have questions or you are confused about the directions for your medicine. Call if you have any side effects from your medicines. DO NOT stop taking any medicine unless your health care provider tells you to stop.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000783.htm
Answer: Summary : Taking acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help children with colds and fever feel better. As with all drugs, it is important to give children the correct dose. Acetaminophen is safe when taken as directed. But taking too much of this medicine can be harmful.

How Acetaminophen Can Help Your Child : Acetaminophen is used to help:  - Reduce aches, pain, sore throat, and fever in children with a cold or the flu  - Relieve pain from a headache or toothache

Proper Dosing of Liquids and Tablets : Children's acetaminophen can be taken as liquid or chewable tablet.   If your child is under 2 years old, check with your health care provider before giving your child acetaminophen.   To give the correct dose, you will need to know your child's weight.   You also need to know how much acetaminophen is in a tablet, teaspoon (tsp), or 5 milliliters (mL) of the product you are using. You can read the label to find out.  - For chewable tablets, the label will tell you how many milligrams (mg) are found in each tablet, such as 80 mg per tablet.  - For liquids, the label will tell you how many mg are found in 1 tsp or in 5 mL, such as 160 mg/1 tsp or 160 mg/5 mL.    For syrups, you will need some type of dosing syringe. It may come with the medicine, or you can ask your pharmacist. Make sure to clean it out after each use.  If your child weighs 24 to 35 lbs:  - For syrup that says 160 mg/5 mL on the label: Give a dose: 5 mL  - For syrup that says 160 mg/1 tsp on the label: Give a dose: 1 tsp  - For chewable tablets that say 80 mg on the label: Give a dose: 2 tablets    If your child weighs 36 to 47 lbs:  - For syrup that says 160 mg/5 mL on the label: Give a dose: 7.5 mL  - For syrup that says 160 mg/1 tsp on the label: Give a dose: 1  tsp  - For chewable tablets that say 80 mg on the label: Give a dose: 3 tablets    If your child weighs 48 to 59 lbs:  - For syrup that says 160 mg/5 mL on the label: Give a dose: 10 mL  - For syrup that says 160 mg/1 tsp on the label: Give a dose: 2 tsp  - For chewable tablets that say 80 mg on the label: Give a dose: 4 tablets    If your child weighs 60 to 71 lbs:  - For syrup that says 160 mg/5 mL on the label: Give a dose: 12.5 mL  - For syrup that says 160 mg/1 tsp on the label: Give a dose: 2  tsp  - For chewable tablets that say 80 mg on the label: Give a dose: 5 tablets  - For chewable tablets that say 160 mg on the label: Give a dose: 2  tablets    If your child weighs 72 to 95 lbs:  - For syrup that says 160 mg/5 mL on the label: Give a dose: 15 mL  - For syrup that says 160 mg/1 tsp on the label: Give a dose: 3 tsp  - For chewable tablets that say 80 mg on the label: Give a dose: 6 tablets  - For chewable tablets that say 160 mg on the label: Give a dose: 3 tablets    If your child weighs 96 lbs or more:  - For syrup that says 160 mg/5 mL on the label: Give a dose: 20 mL  - For syrup that says 160 mg/1 tsp on the label: Give a dose: 4 tsp  - For chewable tablets that say 80 mg on the label: Give a dose: 8 tablets  - For chewable tablets that say 160 mg on the label: Give a dose: 4 tablets    You may repeat the dose every 4 to 6 hours as needed. DO NOT give your child more than 5 doses in 24 hours.  If you are not sure how much to give your child, call your health care provider.

Proper Dosing of Suppositories : If your child is vomiting or will not take oral medicine, you can use suppositories. Suppositories are placed in the anus to deliver medicine.   You can use suppositories in children older than 6 months. Always check with your health care provider before giving any medicine to children under 2 years old.   This medicine is given every 4 to 6 hours.  If your child is 6 to 11 months:  - For infant suppositories that read 80 milligrams (mg) on the label: Give a dose: 1 suppository every 6 hours  - Maximum dose: 4 doses in 24 hours    If your child is 12 to 36 months:  - For infant suppositories that read 80 mg on the label: Give a dose: 1 suppository every 4 to 6 hours  - Maximum dose: 5 doses in 24 hours    If your child is 3 to 6 years:  - For children's suppositories that read 120 mg on the label: Give a dose: 1 suppository every 4 to 6 hours  - Maximum dose: 5 doses in 24 hours    If your child is 6 to 12 years:  - For junior-strength suppositories that read 325 mg on the label: Give a dose: 1 suppository every 4 to 6 hours  - Maximum dose: 5 doses in 24 hours    If your child is 12 yearsand over:  - For junior-strength suppositories that read 325 mg on the label: Give a dose: 2 suppositories every 4 to 6 hours  - Maximum dose: 6 doses in 24 hours

Giving Medicine to Children : Make sure you do not give your child more than one medicine that contains acetaminophen as an ingredient. For example, acetaminophen can be found in many cold remedies. Read the label before giving any medicine to children. You should not give medicine with more than one active ingredient to children under age 6.  When giving medicine to children, also be sure to follow important child medication safety tips.

If Your Child Takes Too Much : Be sure to post the number for the poison control center by your phone. If you think your child has taken too much medicine, call the poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. It is open 24 hours a day. Signs may include nausea, vomiting, tiredness, and abdominal pain.  Go to the nearest emergency room. Your child may need:  - To get activated charcoal. Charcoal stops the body from absorbing the medicine. It has to be given within an hour, and it does not work for every medicine.  - To be admitted to the hospital so they can be watched closely  - Blood tests to see what the medicine is doing  - To have their heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure monitored

When to Call the Doctor : Call your health care provider if:  - You are not sureabout thedose of medicine to give your infant or child  - You are having trouble getting your child to take medicine  - Your child's symptoms do not go away when you would expect them to go away  - Your child is an infant and has signs of illness, such as fever

Diclofenac tablets and diclofenac delayed-release tablets are usually taken 2, 3, or 4 times a day. Diclofenac solution is taken without food as a one dose treatment to relieve the pain of migraine headaches. If you were told to take diclofenac on a regular basis, take it at around the same time(s) every day.

Answer: Trisomy 13 occurs when extra DNA from chromosome 13 appears in some or all of the body's cells.  - Trisomy 13: the presence of an extra (third) chromosome 13 in all of the cells.  - Trisomy 13: mosaicism, the presence of an extra chromosome 13 in some of the cells.  - Partial trisomy: the presence of a part of an extra chromosome 13 in the cells.   The extra material interferes with normal development.  Trisomy 13 occurs in about 1 out of every 10,000 newborns. Most cases are not passed down through families (inherited). Instead, the events that lead to trisomy 13 occur in either the sperm or the egg that forms the fetus.)

GHR_0000996_Sec4.txt,"Question: Is trisomy 13 inherited ? (Also called: Bartholin-Patau syndrome; complete trisomy 13 syndrome; Patau syndrome; Patau's syndrome; trisomy 13 syndrome)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/trisomy-13
Answer: Most cases of trisomy 13 are not inherited and result from random events during the formation of eggs and sperm in healthy parents. An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of chromosome 13. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra chromosome 13 in each cell of the body.  Translocation trisomy 13 can be inherited. An unaffected person can carry a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 13 and another chromosome. These rearrangements are called balanced translocations because there is no extra material from chromosome 13. A person with a balanced translocation involving chromosome 13 has an increased chance of passing extra material from chromosome 13 to their children.)

Answer: Trisomy 13 can be diagnosed before birth by amniocentesis with chromosome studies of the amniotic cells.  Parents of infants with trisomy 13 that is caused by a translocation should have genetic testing and counseling. This may help them avoid having another child with the condition.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/trisomy-13
Answer: Most cases of trisomy 13 result from having three copies of chromosome 13 in each cell in the body instead of the usual two copies. The extra genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of trisomy 13.  Trisomy 13 can also occur when part of chromosome 13 becomes attached (translocated) to another chromosome during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or very early in fetal development. Affected people have two normal copies of chromosome 13, plus an extra copy of chromosome 13 attached to another chromosome. In rare cases, only part of chromosome 13 is present in three copies. The physical signs and symptoms in these cases may be different than those found in full trisomy 13.  A small percentage of people with trisomy 13 have an extra copy of chromosome 13 in only some of the body's cells. In these people, the condition is called mosaic trisomy 13. The severity of mosaic trisomy 13 depends on the type and number of cells that have the extra chromosome. The physical features of mosaic trisomy 13 are often milder than those of full trisomy 13.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000170.htm
Answer: Peripheral artery disease is caused by arteriosclerosis, or ""hardening of the arteries."" This problem occurs when fatty material (plaque) builds up on the walls of your arteries and makes them narrower. The walls of the arteries also become stiffer and cannot widen (dilate) to allow greater blood flow when needed.   As a result, the muscles of your legs cannot get enough blood and oxygen when they are working harder (such as during exercise or walking). If PAD becomes severe, there may not be enough blood and oxygen, even when the muscles are resting.  Peripheral artery disease is a common disorder. It most often affects men over age 50, but women can have it as well. People are at higher risk if they have a history of:  - Abnormal cholesterol  - Diabetes  - Heart disease (coronary artery disease)  - High blood pressure (hypertension)  - Kidney disease involving hemodialysis  - Smoking  - Stroke (cerebrovascular disease))

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000170.htm
Answer: The main symptoms of PAD are pain, achiness, fatigue, burning, or discomfort in the muscles of your feet, calves, or thighs. These symptoms usually appear during walking or exercise, and go away after several minutes of rest.  - At first, these symptoms may appear only when you walk uphill, walk faster, or walk for longer distances.  - Slowly, these symptoms occur more quickly and with less exercise.  - Your legs or feet may feel numb when you are at rest. The legs also may feel cool to the touch, and the skin may look pale.    When peripheral artery disease becomes severe, you may have:  - Impotence  - Pain and cramps at night  - Pain or tingling in the feet or toes, which can be so severe that even the weight of clothes or bed sheets is painful  - Pain that is worse when you elevate the legs and improves when you dangle your legs over the side of the bed  - Skin that looks dark and blue  - Sores that do not heal)

ADAM_0000665_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Cancer treatment: fertility and sexual side effects in women
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000840.htm
Answer: Summary : Getting treatment for cancer can cause side effects. Some of these side effects can affect your sex life or fertility, which is your ability to have children. These side effects may last for a short time or be permanent. The type of side effects you have depends on your type of cancer and your treatment.

Cancers Most Likely to Have Sexual Side Effects : Many cancer treatments can cause sexual side effects. But you are more likely to have these side effects if you are being treated for one of these types of cancer:  - Cervical cancer  - Ovarian cancer  -  Rectal cancer   - Uterine cancer  - Vaginal cancer  - Breast cancer  - Bladder cancer

Types of Sexual Side Effects : For women, the most common sexual side effects include:  - Loss of desire  - Pain during sex   Other side effects can include:  - Not being able to have an orgasm  - Numbness or pain in the genitals  - Problems with fertility   Many people also have emotional side effects after cancer treatment, such as feeling depressed or bad about your body. These side effects can also affect your sex life. You may not feel like having sex or may not want your partner to touch your body.

How Cancer Treatment Causes These Side Effects : Different types of cancer treatment can affect your sexuality and fertility in different ways.   Surgery for cancer:  - Pelvic surgery can cause pain and problems having sex or getting pregnant.  - Some women who have surgery to remove all or part of a breast find they have less interest in sex.  - The type of side effects you have depends on which part of the body where you have the surgery and how much tissue is removed.    Chemotherapy can cause:  - Loss of sexual desire  - Pain with sex and problems having an orgasm  - Vaginal dryness and shrinking and thinning of the vaginal walls due to lower estrogen.  - Problems with fertility    Radiation therapy can cause:  - Loss of sexual desire  - Changes in the lining of your vagina, which. This can cause pain and problems with fertility.    Hormone therapy for breast cancer can cause:  - Loss of sexual desire  - Vaginal pain or dryness  - Trouble having an orgasm

Talk About Side Effects : One of the most important things you can do is to talk with your doctor about sexual side effects before your treatment. Ask what types of possible side effects to expect and how long they will last. This way, you will know what to expect. You should also talk about these changes with your partner.   If your treatment can cause fertility problems, you may want to see a fertility doctor before your treatment to discuss your options if you want to have children. These options may include freezing your eggs or ovarian tissue.

Sex During Treatment : Although many women continue to have sex during cancer treatment, you may find you are not interested in sex. Both of these responses are normal.   If you do want to have sex, make sure to ask your doctor if it is ok. Also ask about using birth control. In many cases, it is not be safe to get pregnant during cancer treatment.

Coping with Sexual Changes : Sex may feel different for you after your treatment, but there are ways to help cope.  - Focus on the positive. Feeling bad about your body can affect your sex life. Look for little ways to give yourself a lift, such as a new hairstyle, new makeup or a new outfit.  - Give yourself time. It can take months to heal after cancer treatment. DO NOT push yourself to have sex just because you think you should. Once you are ready, remember that it may take longer for you to feel aroused. You also may need to use a lubricant.  - Keep an open mind. There is not just one way to have sex. Try to stay open to all ways of being intimate. Experiment with new ways of touching. You may find that what feels good after treatment is not the same as what felt good before treatment.  - See your doctor. If you are having pain with sex, tell your doctor. They may suggest creams, lubricants, or other treatments.  - Talk with your partner. This is very important. Try to be open about your feelings. Be honest about what would make you feel good. And try to listen to your partner's concerns or desires with an open mind.  - Share your feelings. It is normal to feel anger or grief after cancer treatment. DO NOT hold it in. Talk with close friends and family. It can also help to talk with a counselor if you cannot shake feelings of loss and grief.)

Answer: Antibiotics (tetracycline or doxycycline) are used to treat the disease. Children should not take tetracycline by mouth until after all their permanent teeth have grown in, because it can permanently change the color of growing teeth. Doxycycline that is used for 2 weeks or less usually does not discolor a child's permanent teeth. Rifampin has also been used in people who cannot tolerate doxycycline.)

Answer: Ehrlichiosis is spread by tick bites. Measures should be taken to prevent tick bites, including:  - Wear long pants and long sleeves when walking through heavy brush, tall grass, and thickly wooded areas.  - Pull your socks over the outside of pants to prevent ticks from crawling up your leg.  - Keep your shirt tucked into your pants.  - Wear light-colored clothes so that ticks can be spotted easily.  - Spray your clothes with insect repellent.  - Check your clothes and skin often while in the woods.   After returning home:  - Remove your clothes. Look closely at all skin surfaces, including scalp. Ticks can quickly climb up the length of body.  - Some ticks are large and easy to locate. Other ticks can be quite small, so carefully look at all black or brown spots on the skin.  - If possible, ask someone to help you examine your body for ticks.  - An adult should examine children carefully.   Studies suggest that a tick must be attached to your body for at least 24 hours to cause disease. Early removal may prevent infection.  If you are bitten by a tick, write down the date and time the bite happened. Bring this information, along with the tick (if possible), to your provider if you become sick.)

ADAM_0002187_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Informed consent - adults
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000445.htm
Answer: Summary : You have the right to help decide what medical care is best for you. By law, your health care providers must explain your health condition and treatment choices to you.   Informed consent means:   - You are informed. You have received information about your health condition and treatment options.  - You understand your health condition and treatment options.  - You are able to decide what health care treatment you want to receive and give your consent to receive it.    To obtain your informed consent, your provider may talk with you about the treatment. Then you will read a description of it and sign a form. This is written informed consent.   Or, your provider may explain a treatment to you. They will ask if you agree to have the treatment. Not all medical treatments require written informed consent.

What Treatments Need Informed Consent? : Medical procedures that require you to give written informed consent include:   - Most surgeries, even when they are not done in the hospital.  - Other advanced or complex medical tests and procedures, such as an endoscopy (placing a tube down your throat to look at the inside of your stomach) or a needle biopsy of the liver.  - Radiation or chemotherapy to treat cancer.  - Most vaccines.  - Some blood tests, such as HIV testing (need for written consent varies by state).

What Should Occur During the Informed Consent Process? : When asking for your informed consent, your doctor or other health care provider must explain:  - If treatment is necessary now or if it can wait  - Your health problem and the reason for the treatment  - What happens during the treatment  - The risks of the treatment and how likely they are to occur  - How likely the treatment is to work  - Other options for treating your health problem  - Unknown risks or possible side effects that may happen later on    You should have enough information to make a decision about your treatment. Your provider should also make sure you understand the information. One way a provider may do this is by asking you to repeat the information back in your own words.  If you would like more details about your treatment choices, ask your provider where to look. There are many trusted websites and other resources your provider can give you.

What is Your Role in the Informed Consent Process? : You are an important member of your health care team. You should ask questions about anything you do not understand. If you need your provider to explain something in a different way, ask them to do so.  You have the right to refuse treatment if you are able to understand your health condition, your treatment options, and the risks and benefits of each option. Your doctor or other health care provider may tell you they do not think this is the best choice for you. But, your providers should not try to force you to have a treatment you do not want to have.  It is important to be involved in the informed consent process. After all, you are the one who will receive the treatment if you give your consent.

Other Tips : Informed consent is not needed in an emergency when delayed treatment would be dangerous.  Some people are no longer able to make an informed decision, such as someone with advanced Alzheimer disease or someone in a coma. In both cases, the person would not be able to understand information to decide what medical care they want. In these types of situations, the provider would try to obtain informed consent for treatment from a surrogate, or substitute decision-maker.   Even when your provider does not ask for your written consent, you should still be told what tests or treatments are being done and why. For example:   - Before they have the test, men should know the pros, cons, and the reasons for a PSA blood test that screens for prostate cancer.  - Women should know the pros, cons, and the reasons for a Pap test, a mammogram, or other tests.  - Anyone who is being tested for an infection that occurs after sexual contact should be told about the test and why they are being tested.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000496.htm
Answer: Medicines called corticosteroids can cure minimal change disease in most children. Some children may need to stay on steroids to keep the disease from returning.  In adults, steroids are effective, but less so than in children. Adults may have more frequent relapses and become dependent on steroids.  If steroids are not effective, the health care provider will likely suggest other medicines.  Swelling may be treated with:  - ACE inhibitor medicines  - Blood pressure control  - Diuretics (water pills)   You may also be told to reduce the amount of salt in your diet.)

ADAM_0003077_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Physical activity (Also called: Fitness recommendations; Exercise)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001941.htm
Answer: Summary : Physical activity -- which includes an active lifestyle and routine exercise -- plus eating well, is the best way to stay healthy.

Information : An effective exercise program needs to be fun and keep you motivated. It helps to have a goal.  Your goal might be to:  - Manage a health condition  - Reduce stress  - Improve your stamina  - Buy clothes in a smaller size    Your exercise program can also be a good way for you to socialize. Taking exercise classes or exercising with a friend are both good ways to be social.  You may have a hard time starting an exercise routine, but once you do start, you may begin to notice other benefits, such as:  - Better control of your weight and appetite  - Improved fitness, making it easier to do everyday activities  - Improved sleep  - More confidence in yourself  - Lower risk for heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure    GETTING STARTED  You do not need to join a gym to exercise. If you have not exercised or been active in a long time, start slowly to prevent injuries. Taking a brisk 10-minute walk twice a week is a good start.  Try joining a dance, yoga, or karate class if it appeals to you. You could also join a baseball or bowling team, or even a mall-walking group. The social aspects of these groups can be rewarding and motivating.  The most important thing is to do exercises that you can maintain and enjoy.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Talk with your health care provider before starting an exercise program if:  - You have diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, or another long-term illness  - You are obese  - You have not been very active lately  - You get chest pains or shortness of breath when you are active    Build physical activity into your regular routine  Simple lifestyle changes can make a big difference over time.  - At work, try taking the stairs instead of the elevator, walking down the hall to talk with a co-worker instead of sending an email, or adding a 10- to 20-minute walk during lunch.  - When you are running errands, try parking at the far end of the parking lot or down the street. Even better, walk to the store or other nearby places.  - At home, do chores such as vacuuming, washing the car, gardening, raking leaves, or shoveling snow.  - If you ride the bus or other public transportation, get off 1 stop before your usual stop and walk the rest of the way.    REDUCE YOUR SCREEN TIME  Sedentary behaviors are things you do while you are sitting still. Decreasing your sedentary behaviors can help you lose weight. For most people, the best way to decrease sedentary behaviors is to reduce the time they spend watching TV and using a computer and other electronic devices. All of these activities are called ""screen time.""  Some ways to decrease screen time are:  - Choose 1 or 2 TV programs to watch, and turn off the TV when they are over.  - Do not keep the TV on all the time for background noise -- you might end up sitting down and watching it. Turn on the radio instead. You can be up doing things around the house and still listen tothe radio.  - Do not eat while you watch TV.  - Take the batteries out of your TV remote control and get up to change the channel.  - Before you turn on the TV, take your dog or a neighbor's dog for a walk. If you are going to miss your favorite show, record it.  - Find activities to replace TV watching. Read a book, play a board game with family or friends, or take an evening cooking class.  - Work out on an exercise or yoga ball while you watch TV. You will burn calories. Or, set up a stationary bike or treadmill in front of your TV and use it while you watch.    If you like playing video games, try games that require you to move your whole body, not just your thumbs.   HOW MUCH EXERCISE DO YOU NEED?  Aim to exercise about 2.5 hours a week. It's important to do both moderate-intensity aerobic activity that increases your heart rate and muscle strengthening. Muscle strengthening, also called strength training, resistance training, or endurance exercise, should be done 2 times a week. Depending on your schedule, you could exercise for 30 minutes 5 days a week, or 45 to 60 minutes 3 days a week.  You do not have to do your total daily exercise all at once. If your goal is to exercise for 30 minutes, you can break that up into shorter time periods that add up to 30 minutes.  As you become more fit, you can challenge yourself by increasing the intensity of your exercise by going from light to moderate activity. You can also increase the amount of time you exercise.)

ADAM_0001279_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Drinking water safely during cancer treatment
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000060.htm
Answer: Summary : During and right after your cancer treatment, your body cannot protect itself against infections. Tiny germs can be in water, even when it looks clean. You need to be careful where you get your water from. This includes water for drinking, cooking, and brushing your teeth. Ask your doctor or nurse about special care you should take.

Tap water : Tap water is water from your faucet. It should be safe when it comes from:  - A city water supply  - A city well that supplies many people with water    If you live in a small city or town, check with your local water department. Ask if they test the water every day for the kind of germs that can give you an infection -- germs are called coliforms.

Well water : Boil water from a private well or a small community well before you drink it or use it for cooking or brushing your teeth.  Running well water through a filter or adding chlorine to it does not make it safe to use. Test your well water at least once a year for coliform germs that may cause an infection. Test your water more often if coliforms are found in it or if there is any question about the safety of your water.  To boil water and store it:  - Heat the water to a rolling boil.  - Keep the water boiling for at least 1 minute.  - After boiling the water, store it in the refrigerator in a clean and covered container.  - Use all this water within 3 days (72 hours). If you do not use it in this time, pour it down the drain or use it to water your plants or your garden.

Bottled water : The label on any bottled water you drink should say how it was cleaned. Look for these words:  - Reverse osmosis filtration  - Distillation or distilled

Water filters : Tap water should be safe when it comes from a city water supply or a city well that supplies many people with water. It does not need to be filtered.  You should boil water that comes from a private well or a small local well, even if you have a filter.  Many sink filters, filters in refrigerators, pitchers that use filters, and some filters for camping do not remove germs.  If you have a home water-filtering system (such as a filter under your sink), change the filter as often as the manufacturer recommends.)

ADAM_0003450_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Safe driving for teens (Also called: Driving and teenagers; Teens and safe driving; Automobile safety - teenage drivers)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001930.htm
Answer: Summary : Learning to drive is an exciting time for teenagers and their parents. It opens up many options for a young person, but it also carries risks. Young people between ages 15 and 24 have the highest rate of auto-related deaths. The rate is the highest for young men.   Parents and teens should be aware of problem areas and take steps to avoid hazards.

Information : Make a Commitment to Safety  Teens also need to commit to being safe and responsible drivers in order to improve the odds in their favor.  - Reckless driving is still a danger to teens -- even with automobile safety features.  - All new drivers should take a driver's education course. These courses can reduce risk for crashes.    Drivers and passengers should use automobile safety features at all times. These include: seat belts, shoulder straps, and headrests. Only drive cars that have air bags, padded dashes, safety glass, collapsible steering columns, and anti-lock brakes.  Auto accidents are also a leading cause of death in infants and children. Infants and young children should be properly buckled into a child safety seat of the right size that is correctly installed in the vehicle.  Avoid Distracted Driving   Distractions are a problem for all drivers. Do not use cell phones for talking, texting, or email when you are driving.   - Mobile phones should be turned off when driving so you are not tempted to make calls, send or read texts, or answer the phone.  - If phones are left on for emergency use, pull off of the road before answering or texting.    Other tips include:  - Avoid putting on makeup while driving, even when stopped at a light or stop sign, it can be dangerous.  - Finish eating before starting your car and driving.    Driving with friends can lead to accidents.  - Teens are safer driving alone or with family. For the first 6 months, teens should drive with an adult driver who can help them learn good driving habits.  - New drivers should wait at least 3 to 6 months before taking friends as passengers.    Teenage-related driving deaths occur more often in certain conditions.  Other safety tips for teens  - Reckless driving is still a danger, even when using seatbelts. Do not rush. It is safer to be late.  - Avoid driving at nighttime. Your driving skills and reflexes are just developing during the first months of driving. Darkness adds an extra factor to cope with.  - When drowsy, stop driving until fully alert. Sleepiness may cause more accidents than alcohol.  - Never drink and drive. Drinking slows reflexes and hurts judgment. These effects happen to anyone who drinks. So, NEVER drink and drive. ALWAYS find someone to drive who has not been drinking -- even if this means making an uncomfortable phone call.  - Drugs can be just as dangerous as alcohol. Do not mix driving with marijuana, other illegal drugs or any prescribedmedicine that makes you sleepy.   Parents should talk with their teens about ""household driving rules.""  - Make a written ""driving contract"" that both parents and teens sign.  - The contract should include a list of driving rules and what teens can expect if the rules are broken.  - The contract should state that parents have the final say about the driving rules.  - When writing the contract, take into account all of the driving issues that are likely to come up.    Parents can do the following to help prevent teens from drinking and driving:  - Tell their teens to call rather than get in a car with a driver who has been drinking or when they have been drinking. Promise no punishment if they call first.    Some children continue to mix driving and drinking. In many states, the parent must sign for a teenager under 18 to get a driver's license. At any time before the 18th birthday a parent can refuse responsibility and the state will take the license.)

ADAM_0003451_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Safe eating during cancer treatment
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000061.htm
Answer: Summary : When you have cancer, you need good nutrition to help keep your body strong. To do this you need to watch the foods you eat and how you prepare them.  Some raw foods can contain germs that can hurt you when cancer or treatment weakens your immune system. Ask your doctor or nurse about how to eat well but safely.  When you eat eggs:  - Yolks and whites should be cooked solid. Do not eat runny eggs.  - Do not eat foods that may have raw eggs in them (such as Caesar salad dressing, cookie dough, cake batter, and hollandaise sauce).    Be careful when you have dairy products:  - All milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy should have the word pasteurized on their containers.  - Do not eat soft cheeses or cheeses with blue veins (such as Brie, Camembert, Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola, and Bleu).  - Do not eat Mexican-style cheeses (such as queso blanco fresco and cojita).    Fruits and vegetables:  - Wash all raw fruits, vegetables, and fresh herbs with cold running water.  - Do not eat raw vegetable sprouts (such as alfalfa and mung bean).  - Do not use fresh salsa or salad dressings that are kept in the refrigerated cases of the grocery store.  - Drink only juice that says pasteurized on the container.    Do not eat raw honey. Eat only heat-treated honey. Avoid sweets that have creamy fillings.

Cook foods safely : When you cook, make sure you cook your food long enough.  Do not eat uncooked tofu. Cook tofu for at least 5 minutes.  When eating chicken and other poultry:  - Cook whole pieces of poultry to 180 F.  - Cook ground poultry to 165 F.    If you cook beef, lamb, pork, or venison:  - Do not eat raw mean, such as Japanese sashimi.  - Make sure meat is not red or pink before you eat it.  - Cook meat to 160 F.    When eating fish, oysters, and other shellfish:  - Do not eat raw fish (such as sushi), raw oysters, or any other raw shellfish.  - Make sure all fish and shellfish you eat is cooked thoroughly.    Heat all casseroles to 165 F. Warm hot dogs and lunch meats to steaming before you eat them.

Be careful when you eat out : When you dine out, stay away from:  - Raw fruits and vegetables  - Salad bars, buffets, sidewalk vendors, potlucks, and delis    Ask if all fruit juices are pasteurized.  Use only salad dressings, sauces, and salsas from single-serving packages. Eat out at times when restaurants are less crowded. Always ask for your food to be prepared fresh, even at fast food restaurants.)

ADAM_0003452_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Safe sex
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001949.htm
Answer: Summary : Safe sex means taking steps before and during sex that can prevent you from getting an infection, or from giving an infection to your partner.

Information : A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that can be spread to another person through sexual contact. STIs include:  - Chlamydia  - Genital herpes  - Genital warts  - Gonorrhea  - Hepatitis  - HIV  - HPV  - Syphilis    STIs are also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  These infections are spread by direct contact with a sore on the genitals or mouth, body fluids, or sometimes the skin around the genital area.  Before having sex:  - Get to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories  - Don't feel forced into having sex  - Don't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner    Your sexual partner should be someone who you know does not have any STI. Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs and share the test results with each other.  If you know you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know this before you have sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.  Use condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.  - The condom should be in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.  - Keep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with skin areas around the genitals. A condom reduces but does not eliminate your risk of getting an STI.    Other tips include:   - Use lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.  - Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.  - Polyurethane condoms are less likely to break than latex condoms, but they cost more.  - Using condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may increase the chance of HIV transmission.  - Stay sober. Alcohol and drugs impair your judgment. When you are not sober, you might not choose your partner as carefully. You may also forget to use condoms, or use them incorrectly.    Get tested regularly for STIs if you have new sexual partners. Most STIs have no symptoms, so you need to be tested often if there is any chance you have been exposed. You will have the best outcome and will be less likely to spread the infection if you are diagnosed early.  Women should consider getting the HPV vaccine to keep from getting the human papillomavirus. This virus can put you at risk for vaginal warts and cervical cancer.)

ADAM_0003842_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Taking multiple medicines safely
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000883.htm
Answer: Summary : If you take more than one medicine, it is important to take them carefully and safely. Some medicines can interact and cause side effects. It can also be hard to keep track of when and how to take each medicine.  Here are tips to help you keep track of your medicines and take them as directed.

Why you may Need More Than one Medicine : You may take more than one medicine to treat a single condition. Or you may take different medicines to treat more than one health problem. For example, you may take a statin to lower your cholesterol, and a beta-blocker to control your blood pressure.   Older adults often have more than one health condition. So they are more likely to take several medicines.

Risks of Taking Multiple Medicines : The more medicines you take, the more you need to use them carefully. There are several risks when taking multiple medicines.  - You may be more likely to have side effects. Because most medicines can have side effects, the more medicines you take, the more likely you will have side effects. Taking certain medicines can also increase the risk of falls.  - You are at higher risk for drug interactions. An interaction is when one medicine affects how another medicine works. For example, taken together, one medicine may make the other medicine stronger. Medicines can also interact with alcohol and even some foods. Some interactions can be serious, even life threatening.  - You may find it hard to keep track of when to take each medicine. You even may forget which medicine you have taken at a certain time.  - You may take a medicine you do not need. This may be more likely to happen if you see more than one health care provider. You may be prescribed different medicines for the same problem.

People at Higher Risk : Certain people are more likely to have problems from taking multiple medicines:  - People who are prescribed 5 or more medicines. The more medicines you take, the higher the chance of interactions or side effects. You may also find it hard to remember all possible drug interactions.  - People who take medicines prescribed by more than one provider. One provider may not know that you are taking medicines another provider has given you.  - Older adults. As you age, your body processes medicines differently. For instance, your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. This can mean that more medicine stays in your body for longer. This can lead to dangerous levels of medicines in your system.  - People in the hospital. When you are in the hospital, you will likely see new providers who are not familiar with your health history. Without this knowledge, they may prescribe a medicine that may interact with medicines you already take.

What you can do : These suggestions can help you take all of your medicines safely:  - Keep a list of all medicines you take. Your list should include all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. OTC medicines include vitamins, supplements, and herbal products. Keep a copy of the list in your wallet and at home.  - Review your medicine list with your health care providers and pharmacists. Discuss the list with your provider each time you have an appointment. Ask your provider if you still need to take all of the medicines on your list. Also ask if any of the dosages should be changed. Make sure you give all of your providers a copy of your medicine list.  - Ask questions about any new drugs you are prescribed. Make sure you understand how to take them.

ADAM_0004154_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Using over-the-counter medicines safely
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm
Answer: Summary : Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are drugs you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using OTC the medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.  Here is what you need to know about OTC drugs.

About OTC Medicines : You can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:  - Drug stores  - Grocery stores  - Discount and department stores  - Convenience stores  - Some gas stations    When used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:  - Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea  - Preventing problems like heartburn or motion sickness  - Treating conditions such as athletes foot, allergies, or migraine headaches  - Providing first aid

When Should you Use OTC Medicines : It is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:  - Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition  - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take  - What side effects or problems to watch for    Your pharmacist can answer questions such as:  - What the medicine will do  - How it should be stored  - Whether another medicine might work as well or better

What the Label can Tell you : You can also get information about OTC drugs on the medicine label.  Most OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.  Here is what the label will show you:  - Active Ingredient. This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose.  - Uses. The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, DO NOT use the medicine for any condition not listed.  - Warnings. Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. Some medicines you should not take when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose.  - Directions. The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Fully read the directions, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages.  - Other information. This includes such things as how to store the medicine.  - Inactive ingredients. Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.    The label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.

Other Ways to Use OTC Medicines Safely : You should:  - Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with.  - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place you bought it.  - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container.  - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.    Also be sure to take steps to keep kids safe. You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight.)

ADAM_0003842_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Taking multiple medicines safely
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000883.htm
Answer: Summary : If you take more than one medicine, it is important to take them carefully and safely. Some medicines can interact and cause side effects. It can also be hard to keep track of when and how to take each medicine.  Here are tips to help you keep track of your medicines and take them as directed.

Why you may Need More Than one Medicine : You may take more than one medicine to treat a single condition. Or you may take different medicines to treat more than one health problem. For example, you may take a statin to lower your cholesterol, and a beta-blocker to control your blood pressure.   Older adults often have more than one health condition. So they are more likely to take several medicines.

Risks of Taking Multiple Medicines : The more medicines you take, the more you need to use them carefully. There are several risks when taking multiple medicines.  - You may be more likely to have side effects. Because most medicines can have side effects, the more medicines you take, the more likely you will have side effects. Taking certain medicines can also increase the risk of falls.  - You are at higher risk for drug interactions. An interaction is when one medicine affects how another medicine works. For example, taken together, one medicine may make the other medicine stronger. Medicines can also interact with alcohol and even some foods. Some interactions can be serious, even life threatening.  - You may find it hard to keep track of when to take each medicine. You even may forget which medicine you have taken at a certain time.  - You may take a medicine you do not need. This may be more likely to happen if you see more than one health care provider. You may be prescribed different medicines for the same problem.

People at Higher Risk : Certain people are more likely to have problems from taking multiple medicines:  - People who are prescribed 5 or more medicines. The more medicines you take, the higher the chance of interactions or side effects. You may also find it hard to remember all possible drug interactions.  - People who take medicines prescribed by more than one provider. One provider may not know that you are taking medicines another provider has given you.  - Older adults. As you age, your body processes medicines differently. For instance, your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. This can mean that more medicine stays in your body for longer. This can lead to dangerous levels of medicines in your system.  - People in the hospital. When you are in the hospital, you will likely see new providers who are not familiar with your health history. Without this knowledge, they may prescribe a medicine that may interact with medicines you already take.

What you can do : These suggestions can help you take all of your medicines safely:  - Keep a list of all medicines you take. Your list should include all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. OTC medicines include vitamins, supplements, and herbal products. Keep a copy of the list in your wallet and at home.  - Review your medicine list with your health care providers and pharmacists. Discuss the list with your provider each time you have an appointment. Ask your provider if you still need to take all of the medicines on your list. Also ask if any of the dosages should be changed. Make sure you give all of your providers a copy of your medicine list.  - Ask questions about any new drugs you are prescribed. Make sure you understand how to take them. Also ask if a new medicine could interact with any of the medicines or supplements you are already taking.  - Take your medicines exactly as your provider tells you. If you have questions about how or why to take your medicine, ask your provider. DO NOT skip doses, or stop taking your medicines.  - If you notice side effects, tell your health care provider. DO NOT stop taking your medicines unless your provider tells you to.  - Keep your medicines organized. There are many ways to keep track of your medicines. A pill organizer may help. Try one or more methods and see what works for you.  - If you have a hospital stay, bring your medicine list with you. Talk with your provider about medicine safety while you are in the hospital.

When to Call the Doctor : Call if you have questions or you are confused about the directions for your medicine. Call if you have any side effects from your medicines. DO NOT stop taking any medicine unless your health care provider tells you to stop.)

ADAM_0004320_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Wine and heart health (Also called: Health and wine; Wine and heart disease; Preventing heart disease - wine; Preventing heart disease - alcohol)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001963.htm
Answer: Summary : Studies have shown that adults who drink light to moderate amounts of alcohol may be less likely to develop heart disease than those who do not drink at all or are heavy drinkers. However, people who do not drink alcohol should not start just because they want to avoid developing heart disease.

Information : There is a fine line between healthy drinking and risky drinking. DO NOT begin drinking or drink more often just to lower your risk of heart disease. Heavier drinking can harm the heart and liver. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in people who abuse alcohol.  Health care providers recommend that if you drink alcohol, drink only light to moderate amounts:  - For men, limit alcohol to one to two drinks a day.  - For women, limit alcohol to one drink a day.    One drink is defined as:   - 4 ounces of wine  - 12 ounces of beer  - 1 ounces of 80-proof spirits  - 1 ounce of 100-proof spirits    Though research has found that alcohol may help prevent heart disease, much more effective ways to prevent heart disease include:  - Controlling blood pressure and cholesterol  - Exercising and following a low-fat, healthy diet  - Not smoking  - Maintaining an ideal weight   Anyone who has heart disease or heart failure should talk to their provider before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make heart failure and other heart problems worse.)

ADAM_0000140_Sec2.txt,"Question: What is (are) Alcohol use and safe drinking ? (Also called: Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001944.htm
Answer: Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.  TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50 -- coma  - 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death    You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.  HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL  Alcohol increases the risk of:  - Alcoholism  - Falls, drownings, and other accidents  - Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers  - Motor vehicle accidents  - Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  - Suicide and homicide    Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.  RESPONSIBLE DRINKING  If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.  Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:  - Never drink alcohol and drive a car.  - If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.  - Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.    If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.  If alcohol use runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.  CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:  - You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member  - You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use or support groups  - You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking    Other resources include:  - Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups  - Local hospitals  - Public or private mental health agencies  - School or work counselors  - Student or employee health centers)

ADAM_0000052_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Acid mucopolysaccharides (Also called: AMP; Dermatan sulfate - urine; Urine heparan sulfate; Urine dermatan sulfate; Heparan sulfate - urine)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003368.htm
Answer: Summary : Acid mucopolysaccharides is a test that measures the amount of mucopolysaccharides released into the urine either on 1 episode or over a 24-hour period.  Mucopolysaccharides are long chains of sugar molecules in the body. They are often found in mucus and in fluid around the joints.

How the Test is Performed : For the 24-hour test, you must urinate into a special bag or container every time you use the bathroom.  - On day 1, urinate over the toilet into the container or bag when you wake up in the morning. Close the container tightly. Keep it in the refrigerator or a cool place during the collection period.  - Urinate into the special container every time you use the bathroom for the next 24 hours.  - On day 2, urinate into the container in the morning again when you wake up.  - Label the container with your name, the date, the time of completion, and return it as instructed.    For an infant:  Thoroughly wash the area around the urethra (the hole where urine flows out). Open a urine collection bag (a plastic bag with an adhesive paper on one end).  - For males, place the entire penis in the bag and attach the adhesive paper to the skin.  - For females, place the bag over the two folds of skin on either side of the vagina (labia). Put a diaper on the baby (over the bag).    Check the infant often, and change the bag after the infant has urinated. Empty the urine from the bag into the container provided by your doctor.  Active babies can move the bag causing the urine to go into the diaper. You may need extra collection bags.  When finished, label the container and return it as you have been told.

How to Prepare for the Test : There is no special preparation needed.

How the Test will Feel : The test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort.

Why the Test is Performed : This test is done to diagnose a rare group of genetic disorders called mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). These include, Hurler, Scheie, and Hurler/Scheie syndromes (MPS I), Hunter syndrome (MPS II), Sanfilippo syndrome (MPS III), Morquio syndrome (MPS IV), Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (MPS VI), and Sly syndrome (MPS VII).  Most of the time, this test is done in infants who may have a symptom or family history of one of these disorders.

Normal Results : Normal levels vary with age and from lab to lab. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormally high levels could be consistent with a type of mucopolysaccharidosis. Further tests are needed to determine the specific type of mucopolysaccharidosis.)

ADAM_0003342_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about RBC indices (Also called: Erythrocyte indices; Blood indices; Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH); Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC); Mean corpuscular volume (MCV); Red blood cell indices)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003648.htm
Answer: Summary : Red blood cell (RBC) indices are part of the complete blood count (CBC) test. They are used to help diagnose the cause of anemia, a condition in which there are too few red blood cells.  The indices include:  - Average red blood cell size (MCV)  - Hemoglobin amount per red blood cell (MCH)  - The amount of hemoglobin relative to the size of the cell (hemoglobin concentration) per red blood cell (MCHC)

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.

How to Prepare for the Test : No special preparation is necessary.

How the Test will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.

Why the Test is Performed : RBCs transport hemoglobin which, in turn, transports oxygen. The amount of oxygen tissues receive depends on the amount and function of RBCs and hemoglobin.  The MCV reflects the size of red blood cells. The MCH and MCHC reflect the hemoglobin content of red blood cells. These RBC measures are used to diagnose types of anemia.  Anemias are defined based on cell size (MCV) and amount of Hgb (MCH).  - MCV less than lower limit of normal: microcytic anemia  - MCV within normal range: normocytic anemia  - MCV greater than upper limit of normal: macrocytic anemia  - MCH less than lower limit of normal: hypochromic anemia  - MCH within normal range: normochromic anemia  - MCH greater than upper limit of normal: hyperchromic anemia

Normal Results : - MCV: 80 - 100 femtoliter  - MCH: 27 - 31 picograms/cell  - MCHC: 32 - 36 grams/deciliter    The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : This test is used to diagnose the cause of anemia. The following are the types of anemia and their causes:  - Normocytic/normochromic (NC/NC) anemia is caused by sudden blood loss, prosthetic heart valves, blood infection (sepsis), tumor, long-term disease, aplastic anemia, or deficiency of the hormone erythropoietin caused by kidney failure.  - Microcytic/hypochromic anemia is caused by iron deficiency, lead poisoning, blood disorder called thalassemia, or inflammation.  - Macrocytic/normochromic or hyperchromic anemia results from chemotherapy, folate deficiency, or vitamin B12 deficiency.

Risks : Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.  Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling light-headed  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken))

Where Found : Talc may be found in:  - Certain products that kill germs (antiseptics)  - Some baby powder  - Talcum powder  - As a filler in street drugs, like heroin   Other products may also contain talc.

Symptoms : Most symptoms of talcum powder poisoning are caused by breathing in (inhaling) talc dust, especially in infants. Sometimes this happens by accident or over a long period of time.   Breathing problems are the most common problem of inhaling talcum powder. Below are other symptoms of talcum powder poisoning in different parts of the body.  BLADDER AND KIDNEYS  - Urine output is greatly decreased  - No urine output   EYES, EARS, NOSE, and THROAT  - Cough  - Eye irritation  - Throat irritation    STOMACH AND INTESTINES  - Diarrhea  - Vomiting    HEART AND BLOOD  - Collapse  - Convulsions  - Low blood pressure   LUNGS  - Chest pain  - Cough  - Difficulty breathing  - Lung failure  - Rapid, shallow breathing  - Wheezing   NERVOUS SYSTEM  - Coma (decreased level of consciousness and lack of responsiveness)  - Drowsiness  - Fever  - Lack of desire to do anything (lethargy)  - Twitching of arms, hands, legs, or feet  - Twitching of the facial muscles   SKIN  - Blisters  - Blue skin, lips, and fingernails

Home Care : Seek medical help right away. DO NOT make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. If the person breathed in the talcum powder, move them to fresh air right away.

Before Calling Emergency : Have this information ready:  - Person's age, weight, and condition  - Name of the product (ingredients, if known)  - Time it was swallowed  - Amount swallowed

Poison Control : Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room : Take the container to the hospital with you, if possible.  The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate.  The person may receive:  - Blood and urine tests  - Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)  - Chest x-ray  - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)  - Fluids through a vein (by IV)  - Medicine to treat symptoms    The person may be admitted to the hospital.

Outlook (Prognosis) : How well someone does depends on how much talcum powder they swallowed and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Breathing in talcum powder can lead to very serious lung problems, even death.  Use caution when using talcum powder on babies. Talc-free baby powder products are available.  Workers who have regularly breathed in talcum powder over long periods of time have developed serious lung damage and cancer.  Injecting heroin that contains talc into a vein may lead to heart and lung infections and serious organ damage, and even death.)

MPlusHerbsSuppls_0000026_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is Chondroitin sulfate ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/744.html
Answer: Chondroitin sulfate is a chemical that is normally found in cartilage around joints in the body. Chondroitin sulfate is usually manufactured from animal sources, such as shark and cow cartilage.     Chondroitin sulfate is used for osteoarthritis. It is often used in combination with other ingredients, including manganese ascorbate, glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, or N-acetyl glucosamine.      Chondroitin sulfate is also taken by mouth for HIV/AIDS, heart disease, heart attack, weak bones (osteoporosis), joint pain caused by drugs used to treat breast cancer, acid reflux, high cholesterol, muscle soreness after exercise, a bladder condition called interstitial cystitis, a bone disease called Kashin-Beck disease, and itchy and scaly skin (psoriasis). Chondroitin sulfate is also used in a complex with iron for treating iron-deficiency anemia.     Chondroitin sulfate is available as an eye drop for dry eyes. In addition, it is used during cataract surgery, and as a solution for preserving corneas used for transplants. It is approved by the FDA for these uses.     Some people with osteoarthritis use ointments or skin creams for pain that contain chondroitin sulfate, in combination with glucosamine sulfate, shark cartilage, and camphor.      Some people also inject chondroitin sulfate into the muscles for osteoarthritis.     Some people insert chondroitin sulfate into the bladder for urinary tract infections (UTIs), bladder conditions, or loss of control of the bladder.)

Answer: The following doses have been studied in scientific research:      BY MOUTH:   - For osteoarthritis: the typical dose of chondroitin sulfate is 800-2000 mg taken as a single dose or in two or three divided doses daily for up to 3 years.   APPLIED TO THE SKIN:   - For osteoarthritis: a cream containing 50 mg/gram of chondroitin sulfate, 30 mg/gram of glucosamine sulfate, 140 mg/gram of shark cartilage, and 32 mg/gram of camphor has been used as needed for sore joints for up to 8 weeks.   INJECTED INTO THE MUSCLE:   - For osteoarthritis: chondroitin sulfate (Matrix) has been injected into the muscle daily or twice weekly for 6 months.   INSERTED INTO THE BLADDER:   - For urinary tract infections (UTIs): 50 mL of a specific solution containing chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid (iAluRil, IBSA Farmaceutici), has been inserted into the bladder once weekly for 4 weeks, and then once or twice monthly for up to 5 months.

MPlusHerbsSuppls_0000040_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is Glucosamine hydrochloride ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/747.html
Answer: Glucosamine is an amino sugar that is produced naturally in humans. It is also found in seashells, or it can be made in the laboratory. Glucosamine hydrochloride is one of several forms of glucosamine.     It is important to read the labels of glucosamine products carefully since several different forms of glucosamine are sold as supplements. These products may contain glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, or N-acetyl-glucosamine. These different chemicals have some similarities. But they may not have the same effects when taken as a dietary supplement. Most of the scientific research on glucosamine has been done using glucosamine sulfate. See the separate listing for glucosamine sulfate. The information on this page is about glucosamine hydrochloride.     Dietary supplements that contain glucosamine often contain additional ingredients. These additional ingredients are frequently chondroitin sulfate, MSM, or shark cartilage. Some people think these combinations work better than taking just glucosamine alone. So far, researchers have found no proof that combining the additional ingredients with glucosamine adds any benefit.     Products that contain glucosamine and glucosamine plus chondroitin vary a great deal. Some do not contain what the label claims. The difference can range from 25% to 115%. Some products in the US that are labeled glucosamine sulfate are actually glucosamine hydrochloride with added sulfate. This product will likely have different effects than one containing glucosamine sulfate.     People take glucosamine hydrochloride by mouth for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, glaucoma, a jaw disorder called temporomandibular disorder (TMD), joint pain, back pain, and weight loss.     Glucosamine hydrochloride is applied to the skin in combination with chondroitin sulfate, shark cartilage, and camphor for osteoarthritis.     Glucosamine hydrochloride is used parenterally and short-term to reduce osteoarthritis symptoms.)

MPlusHerbsSuppls_0000041_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is Glucosamine sulfate ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/807.html
Answer: Glucosamine sulfate is a naturally occurring chemical found in the human body. It is in the fluid that is around joints. Glucosamine is also found in other places in nature. For example, the glucosamine sulfate that is put into dietary supplements is often harvested from the shells of shellfish. Glucosamine sulfate used in dietary supplements does not always come from natural sources. It can also be made in a laboratory.     There are different forms of glucosamine including glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, and N-acetyl-glucosamine. These different chemicals have some similarities; however, they may not have the same effects when taken as a dietary supplement. Most of the scientific research done on glucosamine has been done on glucosamine sulfate. The information on this page pertains to glucosamine sulfate. For information on the other forms of glucosamine, see the specific pages for each of them.     Dietary supplements that contain glucosamine often contain additional ingredients. These additional ingredients are frequently chondroitin sulfate, MSM, or shark cartilage. Some people think these combinations work better than taking just glucosamine sulfate alone. So far, researchers have found no proof that combining the additional ingredients with glucosamine adds any benefit.     Some glucosamine sulfate products are not labeled accurately. In some cases, the amount of glucosamine actually in the product has varied from none to over 100% of the amount stated on the product's label. Some products have contained glucosamine hydrochloride when glucosamine sulfate was listed on the label.     Glucosamine sulfate is taken by mouth for osteoarthritis, glaucoma, weight loss, joint pain caused by drugs, a bladder condition called interstitial cystitis, jaw pain, joint pain including knee pain, back pain, multiple sclerosis, and HIV/AIDS.     Glucosamine is also in some skin creams used to control arthritis pain. These creams usually contain camphor and other ingredients in addition to glucosamine.     Glucosamine sulfate is used parenterally for osteoarthritis.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/807.html
Answer: Glucosamine sulfate is a chemical found in the human body. It is used by the body to produce a variety of other chemicals that are involved in building tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and the thick fluid that surrounds joints.     Joints are cushioned by the fluid and cartilage that surround them. In some people with osteoarthritis, the cartilage breaks down and becomes thin. This results in more joint friction, pain, and stiffness. Researchers think that taking glucosamine supplements may either increase the cartilage and fluid surrounding joints or help prevent breakdown of these substances, or maybe both.     Some researchers think the ""sulfate"" part of glucosamine sulfate is also important. Sulfate is needed by the body to produce cartilage. This is one reason why researchers believe that glucosamine sulfate might work better than other forms of glucosamine such as glucosamine hydrochloride or N-acetyl glucosamine. These other forms do not contain sulfate.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001925.htm
Answer: You can stay healthy during travel by taking the right steps to protect yourself before you go. You can also do things to help prevent disease while you are traveling. Most infections you catch while traveling are minor. In rare cases, however, they can be severe, or even deadly.  Diseases vary in different places in the world. You will need to take different preventive steps, depending on where you are going. The following things should be considered:  - Local climate  - Insects and parasites  - Sanitation    The best public sources for up-to-date travel information are the:  - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) -- wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel  - World Health Organization (WHO) -- www.who.int/ith/en   BEFORE TRAVEL  Talk to your health care provider or visit a travel clinic 4 - 6 weeks before you leave for your trip. You may need several vaccinations. Some of these need time to work.  You also may need to update your vaccinations. For example, you may need ""booster"" vaccines for:  - Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (Tdap)  - Influenza (flu)  - Measles - mumps - rubella (MMR)  - Polio   You also may need vaccines for diseases that are not commonly found in North America. Examples of recommended vaccines include:  - Hepatitis A  - Hepatitis B  - Meningococcal  - Typhoid    Certain countries have required vaccinations. You may need proof that you have had this vaccine in order to enter the country.  - Yellow fever vaccination is required to enter several Sub-Saharan, Central African, and South American countries.  - Meningococcal vaccination is required to enter Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrimage.  - For a complete list of country requirements, check the CDC or WHO web sites.    People who may have different vaccine requirements include:  - Children  - Elderly people  - People with weakened immune systems or HIV  - People who expect to be in contact with certain animals  - Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding    Check with your health care provider or local travel clinic.  PREVENTING MALARIA  Malaria is a serious disease that spreads by the bite of certain mosquitoes. It occurs mainly in tropical and subtropical climates. Malaria can cause high fevers, shaking chills, flu-like symptoms, and anemia.  If you are traveling to an area where malaria is common, you may need to take medicines that prevent the disease. These medicines are taken before you leave, during your travel, and for a short period after you return. How well the medicines work vary. You should also take steps to prevent insect bites.  PREVENTING INSECT BITES  To prevent against bites from mosquitoes and other insects:  - Wear insect repellent containing DEET or picaridin when you are outdoors, but use it safely.  - You may also need to use a bed mosquito net while you sleep.  - Wear trousers and long-sleeved shirts, particularly at dusk.  - Sleep only in screened areas.  - Do not wear perfumes.    FOOD AND WATER SAFETY  You can get some types of infections by eating or drinking contaminated food or water. There is a high risk of infection from eating undercooked or raw foods.  Stay away from the following foods:  - Cooked food that has been allowed to cool (such as from street vendors)  - Fruit that has not been washed with clean water and then peeled  - Raw vegetables  - Salads  - Unpasteurized dairy foods, such as milk or cheese    Drinking untreated or contaminated water can lead to infection. Only drink the following liquids:  - Canned or unopened bottled beverages (water, juice, carbonated mineral water, soft drinks)  - Drinks made with boiled water, such as tea and coffee    Do not use ice in your drinks unless it is made from purified water. You can purify water by boiling it or by treating it with certain chemical kits or water filters.  OTHER STEPS TO PREVENT INFECTIOUS DISEASES  Clean your hands often. Use soap and water or an alcohol-based cleanser to help prevent infection.  Do not stand or swim in fresh-water rivers, streams, or lakes that have sewage or animal feces in them. This can lead to infection. Swimming in chlorinated pools is safe most of the time.  WHEN TO CONTACT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL  Diarrhea can sometimes be treated with rest and fluids. Your health care provider may give you an antibiotic to take on your trip in case you get sick with severe diarrhea while traveling.  Get medical care right away if:  - Diarrhea does not go away  - You develop a high fever or become dehydrated    Contact your health care provider when you return home if you were sick with a fever while traveling.)

URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/4-steps-manage-diabetes/Pages/publicationdetail.aspx
Answer: What is diabetes?
                
There are three main types of diabetes:
                
- Type 1 diabetes  Your body does not make insulin. This is a problem because you need insulin to take the sugar (glucose) from the foods you eat and turn it into energy for your body. You need to take insulin every day to live.   - Type 2 diabetes  Your body does not make or use insulin well. You may need to take pills or insulin to help control your diabetes. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes.   - Gestational (jest-TAY-shun-al) diabetes  Some women get this kind of diabetes when they are pregnant. Most of the time, it goes away after the baby is born. But even if it goes away, these women and their children have a greater chance of getting diabetes later in life.
                
You are the most important member of your health care team.
                
You are the one who manages your diabetes day by day. Talk to your doctor about how you can best care for your diabetes to stay healthy. Some others who can help are:
                

                
- dentist    - diabetes doctor    - diabetes educator    - dietitian    - eye doctor    - foot doctor     - friends and family    - mental health counselor    - nurse    - nurse practitioner    - pharmacist    - social worker
                
How to learn more about diabetes.
                
- Take classes to learn more about living with diabetes. To find a class, check with your health care team, hospital, or area health clinic. You can also search online.   - Join a support group  in-person or online  to get peer support with managing your diabetes.   - Read about diabetes online. Go to National Diabetes Education Program.
                
Take diabetes seriously.
                
You may have heard people say they have a touch of diabetes or that their sugar is a little high. These words suggest that diabetes is not a serious disease. That is not correct. Diabetes is serious, but you can learn to manage it.
                
People with diabetes need to make healthy food choices, stay at a healthy weight, move more every day, and take their medicine even when they feel good. Its a lot to do. Its not easy, but its worth it!
                
Why take care of your diabetes?
                
Taking care of yourself and your diabetes can help you feel good today and in the future. When your blood sugar (glucose) is close to normal, you are likely to:
                
- have more energy   - be less tired and thirsty   - need to pass urine less often   - heal better   - have fewer skin or bladder infections
                
You will also have less chance of having health problems caused by diabetes such as:
                
- heart attack or stroke   - eye problems that can lead to trouble seeing or going blind   - pain, tingling, or numbness in your hands and feet, also called nerve damage   - kidney problems that can cause your kidneys to stop working   - teeth and gum problems
                
Actions you can take
                
-  Ask your health care team what type of diabetes you have.  -  Learn where you can go for support.  -  Learn how caring for your diabetes helps you feel good today and in the future.)

NIDDK_0000042_Sec10.txt,"Question: What to do for Hypoglycemia ?
URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/hypoglycemia/Pages/index.aspx
Answer: Two types of hypoglycemia can occur in people who do not have diabetes:
                
- Reactive hypoglycemia, also called postprandial hypoglycemia, occurs within 4 hours after meals.  - Fasting hypoglycemia, also called postabsorptive hypoglycemia, is often related to an underlying disease.
                
Symptoms of both reactive and fasting hypoglycemia are similar to diabetes-related hypoglycemia. Symptoms may include hunger, sweating, shakiness, dizziness, light-headedness, sleepiness, confusion, difficulty speaking, anxiety, and weakness.
                
To find the cause of a patient's hypoglycemia, the doctor will use laboratory tests to measure blood glucose, insulin, and other chemicals that play a part in the body's use of energy.
                
Reactive Hypoglycemia
                
Diagnosis
                
To diagnose reactive hypoglycemia, the doctor may
                
- ask about signs and symptoms  - test blood glucose while the patient is having symptoms by taking a blood sample from the arm and sending it to a laboratory for analysis*  - check to see whether the symptoms ease after the patient's blood glucose returns to 70 mg/dL or above after eating or drinking
                
A blood glucose level below 70 mg/dL at the time of symptoms and relief after eating will confirm the diagnosis. The oral glucose tolerance test is no longer used to diagnose reactive hypoglycemia because experts now know the test can actually trigger hypoglycemic symptoms.
                
Causes and Treatment
                
The causes of most cases of reactive hypoglycemia are still open to debate. Some researchers suggest that certain people may be more sensitive to the body's normal release of the hormone epinephrine, which causes many of the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Others believe deficiencies in glucagon secretion might lead to reactive hypoglycemia.
                
A few causes of reactive hypoglycemia are certain, but they are uncommon. Gastricor stomachsurgery can cause reactive hypoglycemia because of the rapid passage of food into the small intestine. Rare enzyme deficiencies diagnosed early in life, such as hereditary fructose intolerance, also may cause reactive hypoglycemia.
                
To relieve reactive hypoglycemia, some health professionals recommend
                
- eating small meals and snacks about every 3 hours  - being physically active  - eating a variety of foods, including meat, poultry, fish, or nonmeat sources of protein; starchy foods such as whole-grain bread, rice, and potatoes; fruits; vegetables; and dairy products  - eating foods high in fiber  - avoiding or limiting foods high in sugar, especially on an empty stomach
                
The doctor can refer patients to a registered dietitian for personalized meal planning advice. Although some health professionals recommend a diet high in protein and low in carbohydrates, studies have not proven the effectiveness of this kind of diet to treat reactive hypoglycemia.
                
Fasting Hypoglycemia
                
Diagnosis
                
Fasting hypoglycemia is diagnosed from a blood sample that shows a blood glucose level below 50 mg/dL after an overnight fast, between meals, or after physical activity.
                
Causes and Treatment
                
Causes of fasting hypoglycemia include certain medications, alcoholic beverages, critical illnesses, hormonal deficiencies, some kinds of tumors, and certain conditions occurring in infancy and childhood.
                
Medications. Medications, including some used to treat diabetes, are the most common cause of hypoglycemia. Other medications that can cause hypoglycemia include
                
- salicylates, including aspirin, when taken in large doses  - sulfa medications, which are used to treat bacterial infections  - pentamidine, which treats a serious kind of pneumonia  - quinine, which is used to treat malaria
                
If using any of these medications causes a person's blood glucose level to fall, the doctor may advise stopping the medication or changing the dose.
                
Alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcoholic beverages, especially binge drinking, can cause hypoglycemia. The body's breakdown of alcohol interferes with the liver's efforts to raise blood glucose. Hypoglycemia caused by excessive drinking can be serious and even fatal.
                
Critical illnesses. Some illnesses that affect the liver, heart, or kidneys can cause hypoglycemia. Sepsis, which is an overwhelming infection, and starvation are other causes of hypoglycemia. In these cases, treating the illness or other underlying cause will correct the hypoglycemia.
                
Hormonal deficiencies. Hormonal deficiencies may cause hypoglycemia in very young children, but rarely in adults. Shortages of cortisol, growth hormone, glucagon, or epinephrine can lead to fasting hypoglycemia. Laboratory tests for hormone levels will determine a diagnosis and treatment. Hormone replacement therapy may be advised.
                
Tumors. Insulinomas are insulin-producing tumors in the pancreas. Insulinomas can cause hypoglycemia by raising insulin levels too high in relation to the blood glucose level. These tumors are rare and do not normally spread to other parts of the body. Laboratory tests can pinpoint the exact cause. Treatment involves both short-term steps to correct the hypoglycemia and medical or surgical measures to remove the tumor.
                
Conditions occurring in infancy and childhood. Children rarely develop hypoglycemia. If they do, causes may include the following:
                
- Brief intolerance to fasting, often during an illness that disturbs regular eating patterns. Children usually outgrow this tendency by age 10.  - Hyperinsulinism, which is the overproduction of insulin. This condition can result in temporary hypoglycemia in newborns, which is common in infants of mothers with diabetes. Persistent hyperinsulinism in infants or children is a complex disorder that requires prompt evaluation and treatment by a specialist.  - Enzyme deficiencies that affect carbohydrate metabolism. These deficiencies can interfere with the body's ability to process natural sugars, such as fructose and galactose, glycogen, or other metabolites.  - Hormonal deficiencies such as lack of pituitary or adrenal hormones.

Answer: Diabetes-related Hypoglycemia
                
- When people with diabetes think their blood glucose level is low, they should check it and treat the problem right away.  - To treat hypoglycemia, people should have a serving of a quick-fix food, wait 15 minutes, and check their blood glucose again. They should repeat the treatment until their blood glucose is 70 mg/dL or above.  - People at risk for hypoglycemia should keep quick-fix foods in the car, at workanywhere they spend time.  - People at risk for hypoglycemia should be careful when driving. They should check their blood glucose frequently and snack as needed to keep their level 70 mg/dL or above.
                
Hypoglycemia Unrelated to Diabetes
                
- In reactive hypoglycemia, symptoms occur within 4 hours of eating. People with reactive hypoglycemia are usually advised to follow a healthy eating plan recommended by a registered dietitian.  - Fasting hypoglycemia can be caused by certain medications, critical illnesses, hereditary enzyme or hormonal deficiencies, and some kinds of tumors. Treatment targets the underlying problem.)

NIDDK_0000042_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Hypoglycemia ?
URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/hypoglycemia/Pages/index.aspx
Answer: Hypoglycemia, also called low blood glucose or low blood sugar, occurs when blood glucose drops below normal levels. Glucose, an important source of energy for the body, comes from food. Carbohydrates are the main dietary source of glucose. Rice, potatoes, bread, tortillas, cereal, milk, fruit, and sweets are all carbohydrate-rich foods.
                
After a meal, glucose is absorbed into the bloodstream and carried to the body's cells. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps the cells use glucose for energy. If a person takes in more glucose than the body needs at the time, the body stores the extra glucose in the liver and muscles in a form called glycogen. The body can use glycogen for energy between meals. Extra glucose can also be changed to fat and stored in fat cells. Fat can also be used for energy.
                
When blood glucose begins to fall, glucagonanother hormone made by the pancreassignals the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose into the bloodstream. Blood glucose will then rise toward a normal level. In some people with diabetes, this glucagon response to hypoglycemia is impaired and other hormones such as epinephrine, also called adrenaline, may raise the blood glucose level. But with diabetes treated with insulin or pills that increase insulin production, glucose levels can't easily return to the normal range.
                
Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly. It is usually mild and can be treated quickly and easily by eating or drinking a small amount of glucose-rich food. If left untreated, hypoglycemia can get worse and cause confusion, clumsiness, or fainting. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, coma, and even death.
                
In adults and children older than 10 years, hypoglycemia is uncommon except as a side effect of diabetes treatment. Hypoglycemia can also result, however, from other medications or diseases, hormone or enzyme deficiencies, or tumors.)

Answer: Diabetes Medications
                
Hypoglycemia can occur as a side effect of some diabetes medications, including insulin and oral diabetes medicationspillsthat increase insulin production, such as
                
- chlorpropamide (Diabinese)  - glimepiride (Amaryl)  - glipizide (Glucotrol, Glucotrol XL)  - glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase, Micronase)  - nateglinide (Starlix)  - repaglinide (Prandin)  - sitagliptin (Januvia)  - tolazamide  - tolbutamide
                
Certain combination pills can also cause hypoglycemia, including
                
- glipizide + metformin (Metaglip)  - glyburide + metformin (Glucovance)  - pioglitazone + glimepiride (Duetact)  - rosiglitazone + glimepiride (Avandaryl)  - sitagliptin + metformin (Janumet)
                
Other types of diabetes pills, when taken alone, do not cause hypoglycemia. Examples of these medications are
                
- acarbose (Precose)  - metformin (Glucophage)  - miglitol (Glyset)  - pioglitazone (Actos)  - rosiglitazone (Avandia)
                
However, taking these pills along with other diabetes medicationsinsulin, pills that increase insulin production, or bothincreases the risk of hypoglycemia.
                
In addition, use of the following injectable medications can cause hypoglycemia:
                
- Pramlintide (Symlin), which is used along with insulin  - Exenatide (Byetta), which can cause hypoglycemia when used in combination with chlorpropamide, glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide, tolazamide, and tolbutamide

NIDDK_0000042_Sec7.txt,"Question: How to prevent Hypoglycemia ?
URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/hypoglycemia/Pages/index.aspx
Answer: Diabetes treatment plans are designed to match the dose and timing of medication to a person's usual schedule of meals and activities. Mismatches could result in hypoglycemia. For example, taking a dose of insulinor other medication that increases insulin levelsbut then skipping a meal could result in hypoglycemia.
                
To help prevent hypoglycemia, people with diabetes should always consider the following:
                
- Their diabetes medications. A health care provider can explain which diabetes medications can cause hypoglycemia and explain how and when to take medications. For good diabetes management, people with diabetes should take diabetes medications in the recommended doses at the recommended times. In some cases, health care providers may suggest that patients learn how to adjust medications to match changes in their schedule or routine.  - Their meal plan. A registered dietitian can help design a meal plan that fits one's personal preferences and lifestyle. Following one's meal plan is important for managing diabetes. People with diabetes should eat regular meals, have enough food at each meal, and try not to skip meals or snacks. Snacks are particularly important for some people before going to sleep or exercising. Some snacks may be more effective than others in preventing hypoglycemia overnight. The dietitian can make recommendations for snacks.  - Their daily activity. To help prevent hypoglycemia caused by physical activity, health care providers may advise      - checking blood glucose before sports, exercise, or other physical activity and having a snack if the level is below 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)    - adjusting medication before physical activity    - checking blood glucose at regular intervals during extended periods of physical activity and having snacks as needed    - checking blood glucose periodically after physical activity    - Their use of alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcoholic beverages, especially on an empty stomach, can cause hypoglycemia, even a day or two later. Heavy drinking can be particularly dangerous for people taking insulin or medications that increase insulin production. Alcoholic beverages should always be consumed with a snack or meal at the same time. A health care provider can suggest how to safely include alcohol in a meal plan.  - Their diabetes management plan. Intensive diabetes managementkeeping blood glucose as close to the normal range as possible to prevent long-term complicationscan increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Those whose goal is tight control should talk with a health care provider about ways to prevent hypoglycemia and how best to treat it if it occurs.
                
What to Ask the Doctor about Diabetes Medications
                
People who take diabetes medications should ask their doctor or health care provider
                
- whether their diabetes medications could cause hypoglycemia  - when they should take their diabetes medications  - how much medication they should take  - whether they should keep taking their diabetes medications when they are sick  - whether they should adjust their medications before physical activity  - whether they should adjust their medications if they skip a meal)

Answer: Infants with low blood sugar may not have symptoms. If your baby has one of the risk factors for low blood sugar, nurses in the hospital will check your baby's blood sugar level, even if there are no symptoms.  Also, blood sugar levelis very often checked for babies with these symptoms:  - Bluish-colored or pale skin  - Breathing problems, such as pauses in breathing (apnea), rapid breathing, or a grunting sound  - Irritability or listlessness  - Loose or floppy muscles  - Poor feeding or vomiting  - Problems keeping the body warm  - Tremors, shakiness, sweating, or seizures)

Answer: The outlook is good for newborns who do not have symptoms, or who respond well to treatment. However, low blood sugar level can return in a small number of babies after treatment.  The condition is more likely to return when babies are taken off intravenous feedings before they are fully ready to eat by mouth.  Babies with more severe symptoms are more likely to develop learning problems. This is more often true for babies who are at a lower-than-average weight or whose mother has diabetes.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007306.htm
Answer: Babies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain.  The baby gets glucose from the mother through the placenta before birth. After birth, the baby gets glucose from the mother through her milk or from formula, and the baby also produces it in the liver.  Glucose level can drop if:  - There is too much insulin in the blood (hyperinsulinism). Insulin is a hormone that pulls glucose from the blood.  - The baby is not producing enough glucose.  - The baby's body is using more glucose than is being produced.  - The baby is not able to feed enough to keep glucose level up.   Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the newborn's glucose level is below the level considered safe for the baby's age. It occurs in about 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 births.  Low blood sugar level ismore likely in infants with one or more of these risk factors:  - Born early, have a serious infection, or needed oxygen right after delivery  - Mother has diabetes (these infants are often larger than normal)  - Have slower than usual growth in the womb during pregnancy  - Are smaller in size than normal for their gestational age)

ADAM_0001823_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Head CT scan (Also called: Brain CT; Cranial CT; CT scan - skull; CT scan - head; CT scan - orbits; CT scan - sinuses; Computed tomography - cranial)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003786.htm
Answer: Summary : A head computed tomography (CT) scan uses many x-rays to create pictures of the head, including the skull, brain, eye sockets, and sinuses.

How the Test is Performed : Head CT is done in the hospital or radiology center.  You lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner.  While inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you.   A computer creates separate images of the body area, called slices. These images can be:   - Stored  - Viewed on a monitor  - Printed on film    Three-dimensional models of the head area can be created by stacking the slices together.  You must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods.  Complete scans usually take only 30 seconds to a few minutes.

How to Prepare for the Test : Certain CT exams require a special dye, called contrast. It is delivered into the body before the test starts. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on x-rays.  - Contrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.  - Let your doctor know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test in order to safely receive it.  - Before receiving the contrast, tell your health care provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage). You may need to take extra precautions. Also let your provider know if you have any kidney function problems as the IV contrast can worsen this problem.    If you weigh more than 300 pounds, find out if the CT machine has a weight limit. Some machines do.   You will be asked to remove jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study.

How the Test will Feel : The x-rays produced by the CT scan are painless. Some people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table.  Contrast given through a vein may cause a:   - Slight burning feeling  - Metallic taste in the mouth  - Warm flushing of the body    This is normal and usually goes away within a few seconds.

Why the Test is Performed : A head CT scan is recommended to help diagnose or monitor the following conditions:  - Birth (congenital) defect of the head or brain  - Brain infection  - Brain tumor  - Buildup of fluid inside the skull (hydrocephalus)  - Craniosynostosis  - Injury (trauma) to the brain, head, or face  - Stroke or bleeding in the brain    A head CT may also be done to look for the cause of:  - Changes in thinking or behavior  - Fainting  - Headache, when you have certain other signs or symptoms  - Hearing loss (in some patients)  - Symptoms of damage to part of the brain, such as vision problems, muscle weakness, numbness and tingling, hearing loss, speaking difficulties, or swallowing problems

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may be due to:  - Abnormal blood vessels (arteriovenous malformation)  - Aneurysm in the brain  - Bleeding (for example, chronic subdural hematoma or intracranial hemorrhage)  - Bone infection  - Brain abscess or infection  - Brain damage due to injury  - Brain tissue swelling or injury  - Brain tumor or other growth (mass)  - Cerebral atrophy (loss of brain tissue)  - Hydrocephalus (fluid collecting in the skull)  - Problems with the hearing nerve  - Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)

Risks : Risks of CT scans include:  - Being exposed to radiation  - Allergic reaction to contrast dye  - Kidney damage from the contrast dye    CT scans use more radiation than regular x-rays. Having many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. You and your doctor should weigh this risk against the benefits of getting a correct diagnosis for a medical problem.   Some people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your doctor know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.  - The most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If a person with an iodine allergy is given this type of contrast, nausea or vomiting, sneezing, itching, or hives may occur.  - If you absolutely must be given such contrast, your doctor may give you antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test to prevent an allergic reaction.  - The kidneys help remove iodine from the body. Those with kidney disease or diabetes may need to receive extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of the body.    In rare cases, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response called anaphylaxis. If you have any trouble breathing during the test, you should notify the scanner operator immediately. Scanners come with an intercom and speakers, so someone can hear you at all times.

Considerations : A CT scan can reduce or avoid the need for invasive procedures to diagnose problems in the skull. This is one of the safest ways to study the head and neck.  Other tests that may be done instead of a head CT scan include:  - MRI of the head  - Positron emission tomography (PET) scan of the head  - Skull x-ray)

ADAM_0003909_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Thoracic CT (Also called: Chest CT; CT scan - lungs; CT scan - chest)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003788.htm
Answer: Summary : Thoracic CT (computed tomography) is an imaging method that uses x-rays to create cross-sectional pictures of the chest and upper abdomen.

How the Test is Performed : The test is done in the following way:  - You may be asked to change into a hospital gown.  - You lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the scanner. Once you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you.   - You must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.   The complete scan takes 30 seconds to a few minutes.   Certain CTscans require a special dye, called contrast, to be delivered into the body before the test starts. Contrast highlights specific areas inside the body and creates a clearer image. If your doctor requests a CT scan with intravenous contrast, you will be given it through a vein (IV) in your arm or hand. A blood test to measure your kidney function may be done before the test. This test is to make sure your kidneys are healthy enough to filter the contrast.

How to Prepare for the Test : Some people have allergies to IV contrast and may need to take medications before their test to safely receive this substance.  Contrast can be given in several ways, depending on the type of CT being performed.  - It may be delivered through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm.  - It may be given through the rectum using an enema.  - You might drink the contrast before your scan. When you actually drink the contrast depends on the type of exam being done. The contrast liquid may taste chalky, although some are flavored to make them taste a little better. The contrast eventually passes out of your body through your stool.    If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.  If you weigh more than 300 pounds, have your doctor contact the scanner operator before the exam. CT scanners have a weight limit. Too much weight can damage the scanner's working parts.  Because it is hard for x-rays to pass through metal, you will be asked to remove jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study.

How the Test will Feel : Some people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table.  Contrast given through an IV may cause a slight burning sensation, a metallic taste in the mouth, and a warm flushing of the body. These sensations are normal and usually go away within a few seconds.  There is no recovery time, unless you were given medicine to relax. After a CT scan, you can go back to your normal diet, activity, and medications.

Why the Test is Performed : CT quickly creates detailed pictures of the body. The test may be used to get a better view of the structures inside the chest.  A thoracic CT may be done:  - After a chest injury  - When a tumor or mass (clump of cells) is suspected, including a solitary pulmonary nodule seen on a chest x-ray  - To determine the size, shape, and position of organs in the chest and upper abdomen  - To look for bleeding or fluid collections in the lungs or other areas  - To look for infection or inflammation in the chest  - To look for blood clots in the lungs

What Abnormal Results Mean : Thoracic CT may show many disorders of the heart, lungs, or chest area, including:  - Abnormalities of the blood vessels in the lungs  - Aortic aneurysm (in the chest area)  - Buildup of blood or fluid  - Collection of fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion)  - Damage to, and widening of the large airways of the lungs (bronchiectasis)  - Enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy)  - Pneumonia  - The stage of some lung tumors or esophageal cancer  - Tumors, nodules, or cysts in the chest    Other conditions under which the test may be performed:  - Alcoholic cardiomyopathy  - Asbestosis  - Atrial myxoma  - Cardiac tamponade  - Coarctation of the aorta  - Dilated cardiomyopathy  - Echinococcus  - Heart failure  - Histoplasmosis  - Hypertensive heart disease  - Idiopathic cardiomyopathy  - Infective endocarditis  - Ischemic cardiomyopathy  - Left-sided heart failure  - Mesothelioma (malignant)  - Metastatic cancer to the lung  - Mitral regurgitation; acute  - Mitral regurgitation; chronic  - Mitral valve prolapse  - Pericarditis; bacterial  - Pericarditis; constrictive  - Pericarditis; post-MI  - Peripartum cardiomyopathy  - Pulmonary edema  - Restrictive cardiomyopathy  - Senile cardiac amyloid  - Superior vena cava obstruction

Risks : CT scans and other x-rays are strictly monitored and controlled to make sure they use the least amount of radiation. CT scans use low levels of ionizing radiation, which has the potential to cause cancer and other defects. However, the risk from any one scan is small. The risk increases as many more studies are done.  In some cases, a CT scan may still be done if the benefits greatly outweigh the risks. For example, it can be more risky to not have the exam if your doctor thinks you might have cancer.  The most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If a person with an iodine allergy is given this type of contrast, nausea, sneezing, vomiting, itching, or hives may occur. In rare cases, the dye can cause a life-threatening allergic response called anaphylaxis. If you have any trouble breathing during the test, you should notify the scanner operator immediately. Scanners come with an intercom and speakers, so the operator can hear you at all times.  In people with kidney problems, the dye may have harmful effects on the kidneys. In these situations, special steps may be taken to make the CT scan safer.

Considerations : A CT scan is one of the best ways of looking at soft tissues such as the heart and lungs.)

ADAM_0000011_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Abdominal CT scan (Also called: Computed tomography scan - abdomen; CT scan - abdomen; CAT scan - abdomen; CT abdomen and pelvis)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003789.htm
Answer: Summary : An abdominal CT scan is an imaging method that uses x-rays to create cross-sectional pictures of the belly area. CT stands for computed tomography.

How the Test is Performed : You will lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner. Most often, you will lie on your back with your arms raised above your head.  Once you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. Modern spiral scanners can perform the exam without stopping.  A computer creates separate images of the belly area. These are called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Three-dimensional models of the belly area can be made by stacking the slices together.  You must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.  In many cases, an abdominal CT is done with a pelvis CT.  The scan should take less than 30 minutes.

How to Prepare for the Test : You need to have a special dye, called contrast, put into your body before some exams. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays.  - Contrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.  - You may have to drink the contrast before the exam. When you drink it will depend on the type of exam being done. Contrast has a chalky taste, although some are flavored so they taste a little better.  - The contrast will pass out of your body through your stools.  - Let your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test to safely receive this substance.  - Before receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medication metformin (Glucophage). People taking this medicine may have to stop taking it for a while before the test.  - Let your provider know if you have any kidney problems. The IV contrast can worsen kidney function.    Too much weight can damage the scanner. Find out if the CT machine has a weight limit if you weigh more than 300 pounds.   You will need to take off your jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study.

How the Test will Feel : Lying on the hard table may be a little bit uncomfortable.  If you have contrast through a vein (IV), you may have:  - Slight burning sensation  - Metallic taste in the mouth  - Warm flushing of the body    These feelings are normal and go away within a few seconds.

Why the Test is Performed : An abdominal CT scan makes detailed pictures of the structures inside your belly (abdomen) very quickly.  This test may be used to look for:  - Cause of abdominal pain or swelling  - Hernia  - Cause of a fever  - Masses and tumors, including cancer  - Infections or injury  - Kidney stones  - Appendicitis

What Abnormal Results Mean : The abdominal CT scan may show some cancers, including:  - Cancer of the renal pelvis or ureter  - Colon cancer  - Hepatocellular carcinoma  - Lymphoma  - Melanoma  - Ovarian cancer  - Pancreatic cancer  - Pheochromocytoma  - Renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer)  - Testicular cancer   The abdominal CT scan may show problems with the gallbladder, liver, or pancreas, including:  - Acute cholecystitis  - Alcoholic liver disease  - Cholelithiasis  - Pancreatic abscess  - Pancreatic pseudocyst  - Pancreatitis  - Blockage of bile ducts   The abdominal CT scan may reveal the following kidney problems:  - Acute bilateral obstructive uropathy  - Acute unilateral obstructive uropathy  - Chronic bilateral obstructive uropathy  - Chronic unilateral obstructive uropathy  - Complicated UTI (pyelonephritis)  - Kidney stones  - Kidney or ureter damage  - Polycystic kidney disease   Abnormal results may also be due to:  - Abdominal aortic aneurysm  - Abscesses  - Appendicitis  - Bowel wall thickening  - Retroperitoneal fibrosis  - Renal artery stenosis  - Renal vein thrombosis

Risks : Risks of CT scans include:  - Allergy to contrast dye  - Exposure to radiation  - Damage to kidney function from contrast dye    CT scans expose you to more radiation than regular x-rays. Many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. Talk to your doctor about this risk and the benefit of the test for getting a correct diagnosis of your medical problem.   Some people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your doctor know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.  - The most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If you have an iodine allergy, you may have nausea or vomiting, sneezing, itching, or hives if you get this type of contrast.  - If you must be given such contrast, your doctor may give you antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.  - Your kidneys help remove iodine from the body. You may need extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of your body if you have kidney disease or diabetes.    Rarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response called anaphylaxis. Tell the scanner operator right away if you have any trouble breathing during the test. Scanners come with an intercom and speakers, so the operator can hear you at all times.)

ADAM_0001258_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Diverticulitis and diverticulosis - discharge ? (Also called: Diverticular disease - discharge)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000192.htm
Answer: You were in the hospital because you have diverticulitis. This is an infection of an abnormal pouch (called a diverticulum) in your intestinal wall.  You may have had a CT scan or other tests that helped your doctor check your colon. You may have received fluids and drugs that fight infections through an intravenous (IV) tube in your vein. You were probably on a special diet to help your colon rest and heal.  If your diverticulitis was very bad, or a repeat of past swelling, you may need surgery.  Your health care provider may also recommend that you have further tests to look at your colon (large intestine) such as colonoscopy. It is important to follow up with these tests.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007668.htm
Answer: Diverticulosis occurs when small, bulging sacs or pouches form on the inner wall of the intestine. These sacs are called diverticula. Most often, these pouches form in the large intestine (colon).)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007668.htm
Answer: Diverticulosis is less common in people age 40 and younger. It's more common in older adults. About half of Americans over age 60 have this condition. Most people will have it by age 80.  No one knows exactly what causes these pouches to form.   For many years, it was thought that eating a low-fiber diet may play a role. Not eating enough fiber can cause constipation (hard stools). Straining to pass stools (feces) increases the pressure in the colon or intestines. This may cause the pouches to form at weak spots in the colon wall. However, whether a low fiber diet leads to this problem is not well proven.  Other possible risk factors that are also not well proven are lack of exercise and obesity.  Eating nuts, popcorn, or corn does not appear to lead to diverticular disease.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007668.htm
Answer: Because most people have no symptoms,most of the time,no treatment is needed.  Your health care provider may recommend getting more fiber in your diet. A high-fiber diet has many health benefits. Most people don't get enough fiber. To help prevent constipation, you should:  - Eat plenty of whole grains, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Limit processed foods.  - Drink plenty of fluids.  - Get regular exercise.  - Talk with your doctor about taking a fiber supplement.   You should avoid NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve). These medicines can make bleeding more likely.  For bleeding that does not stop or recurs:  - Colonoscopy may be used to inject medicines or burn a certain area in the intestine to stop the bleeding  - Angiography may be used to infuse medicines or block off a blood vessel   If bleeding does not stop or recurs many times, removal of a section of the colon may be needed.)

ADAM_0002867_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Orbit CT scan (Also called: CT scan - orbital; Eye CT scan; Computed tomography scan - orbit)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003785.htm
Answer: Summary : A computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbit is an imaging method. It uses x-rays to create detailed pictures of the eye sockets (orbits), eyes and surrounding bones.

How the Test is Performed : You lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner. Only your head is placed inside the CT scanner.  You may be allowed to rest your head on a pillow.  Once you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you.  A computer creates separate images of the body area, called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. The computer can create three-dimensional models of the body area by stacking the slices together.  You must lie still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods.  The actual scan takes about 30 seconds. The entire process takes about 15 minutes.

How to Prepare for the Test : - You will be asked to remove jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study.  - If you weigh more than 300 pounds, find out if the CT machine has a weight limit. Too much weight can cause damage to the scanner's working parts.    Certain exams require a special dye, called contrast, to be delivered into the body before the test starts. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays.  - Contrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.  - Let your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test in order to safely receive this substance.  - Before receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage) because you may need to take extra precautions.  - Before the scan, let your provider know if you have poor kidney function. This is because the contrast may not be able to be used.

How the Test will Feel : Some people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table.  Contrast given through an IV may cause a slight burning sensation. You may also have a metallic taste in the mouth and a warm flushing of the body. These sensations are normal and most often go away within a few seconds.

Why the Test is Performed : This test is helpful for diagnosing diseases that affect the following areas:  - Blood vessels  - Eye muscles  - Eyes  - Nerves supplying the eyes (optic nerves)  - Sinuses    An orbit CT scan may also be used to detect:  - Abscess (infection) of the eye area  - Broken eye socket bone  - Foreign object in the eye socket

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may mean:  - Bleeding  - Broken eye socket bone  - Graves disease  - Infection  - Tumor

Risks : CT scans and other x-rays are strictly monitored and controlled to make sure they use the least amount of radiation. The risk associated with any individual scan is very low. The risk increases as more studies are performed.  CT scans are done when the benefits greatly outweigh the risks. For example, it can be more risky not to have the exam, especially if your provider thinks you might have cancer.  The most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If a person with an iodine allergy is given this type of contrast, nausea, sneezing, vomiting, itching, or hives may occur. If you have a known allergy to contrast but need it for a successful exam, you may receive antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.  The kidneys help filter the iodine out of the body. If you have kidney disease or diabetes, you should be closely monitored for kidney problems after contrast is given. If you have diabetes or have kidney disease, talk to your provider before the test about your risks.  Before receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage) because you may need to take extra precautions and stop the medicine for 48 hours after the test.  In rare cases, the dye can cause a life-threatening allergic response called anaphylaxis. If you have any trouble breathing during the test, you should tell the scanner operator right away. Scanners come with an intercom and speakers, so the operator can hear you at all times.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000454.htm
Answer: Summary : Germs from a person may be found on any object the person touched or on equipment that was used during the person's care. Some germs can live up to 5 months on a dry surface.  Germs on any surface can pass to you or another person. Cleaning helps prevent the spread of germs.  Your workplace has policies about how to clean:  - Patient rooms  - Spills or contamination  - Supplies and equipment that are reusable

Cleaning a Patient's Room : Start by wearing the right personal protective equipment (PPE). Your workplace has a policy or guidelines on what to wear. These policies may differ depending on where in the hospital you are cleaning and the type of illness a patient may have had. PPE includes gloves and, when needed, a gown, shoe covers, and a mask. Always wash your hands before putting gloves on and after taking gloves off.  When you remove bed sheets and towels:  - Hold them away from your body and DO NOT shake them.  - Watch for needles and other sharps.  - DO NOT put the sheets and towels down on another surface in the room. Place them in the correct container.  - Items that are wet or moist should go into a container that will not leak.    Clean the bed rails, furniture, telephone, call light, door knobs, light switches, bathroom, and all other objects and surfaces in the room. Also clean the floor, including under the furniture. Use the disinfectant or cleaning solution your workplace provides for these purposes.  Carefully put any sharps or needles in the sharps container.  When you clean the floors, change the cleaning liquid every hour. Use a fresh mop every day.

Cleaning Spills After Contamination : If your workplace does not have a spill response team for cleaning up blood or other bodily fluids, you will need these supplies to clean up spills:  - Paper towels.  - Diluted bleach solution (be sure you know how to make this solution).  - Biohazard bag.  - Rubber gloves.  - Forceps to pick up sharps or broken glass. Never use your hands, even though you will be wearing gloves.    Make sure you are wearing the correct gloves, gown, mask, or shoe coverings for the kind of spill you are cleaning up.  Before you start cleaning, mark the area of the spill with tape or barriers so that no one enters the area or slips. Then:  - Cover the spill with paper towels.  - Spray the towels with the bleach solution and wait for 20 minutes.  - Pick up the towels and put them in the biohazard bag.  - Carefully put broken glass or sharps in a sharps container.  - Use fresh paper towels to wipe the area with the bleach solution. Put them in the biohazard bag when done.  - Throw your gloves, gown, and shoe covers into the biohazard bag.  - Thoroughly wash your hands.    When cleaning up large blood spills, use an approved solution to kill any viruses such as hepatitis.  Always wash your hands after you take off your gloves.)

Dance video games and DVDs are also a way to get dancing in the privacy of your own home. You can buy them or borrow them from your local library. Or, just turn up the music at home and dance in your living room.

How Dancing Compares to Other Exercise : The workout you get from dance depends on the type of dancing you do and for how long you do it. For example, ballroom dancing will give you a moderate workout. This is about the same level of exercise you would get from walking briskly or doing water aerobics. Most types of ballroom dancing burn about 260 calories in an hour.  More intense types of dance, such as salsa or aerobic dancing, will give you a more vigorous workout that is similar to jogging or swimming laps. You can burn up to 500 calories an hour with these types of dance.

How to Get Started : Look for classes at dance schools, health clubs, or community centers. DO NOT worry if you do not have a partner. Many classes will find you a partner if you do not have one. Some types of dancing, such as tap and line dancing, do not require a partner.  If you are new to dance or you have been inactive, start with a beginner class. A beginner class will be easier to follow and will reduce your risk for injury. As you build your skill and fitness, you can try more advanced classes. You may even want to add new types of dance.  Not sure what type of dance to choose? Ask if you can watch a few classes first. Once you start a class, be patient. It can take some time to learn how to move your body and feet together with the music.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000557.htm
Answer: Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria only occurs in the cold, and affects mainly the hands and feet. Antibodies attach (bind) to red blood cells, which allows other proteins in the blood (called complement) to also latch on. The antibodies destroy the red blood cells as they move through the body and get rewarmed. As the cells are destroyed, hemoglobin, the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen, is released into the blood and passed in the urine.  PCH has been linked to secondary syphilis, tertiary syphilis, and other viral or bacterial infections. Sometimes the cause is unknown.  The disorder is rare.)

Answer: It is called the common cold for good reason. There are over one billion colds in the United States each year. You and your children will probably have more colds than any other type of illness.  Colds are the most common reason that children miss school and parents miss work. Parents often get colds from their children.  Children can get many colds every year. They usually get them from other children. A cold can spread quickly through schools or daycares.  Colds can occur at any time of the year, but they are most common in the winter or rainy seasons.  A cold virus spreads through tiny, air droplets that are released when the sick person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose.  You can catch a cold if:  - A person with a cold sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you  - You touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contaminated by the virus, such as a toy or doorknob.    People are most contagious for the first 2 to 3 days of a cold. A cold is most often not contagious after the first week.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000678.htm
Answer: To lower your chances of getting sick:   - Always wash your hands. Children and adults should wash hands after nose-wiping, diapering, and using the bathroom, and before eating and preparing food.  - Disinfect your environment. Clean commonly touched surfaces (such as sink handles, door knobs, and sleeping mats) with an EPA-approved disinfectant.  - Choose smaller daycare classes for your children.  - Use instant hand sanitizers to stop the spread of germs.  - Use paper towels instead of sharing cloth towels.    The immune system helps your body fight off infection. Here are ways to support the immune system:   - Avoid secondhand smoke. It is responsible for many health problems, including colds.  - DO NOT use antibiotics if they are not needed.  - Breastfeed infants if possible. Breast milk is known to protect against respiratory tract infections in children, even years after you stop breastfeeding.  - Drink plenty of fluids to help your immune system work properly.  - Eat yogurt that contains ""active cultures."" These may help prevent colds. Probiotics may help prevent colds in children.  - Get enough sleep.)

Dry your hands with a clean paper towel and turn faucet off with paper towel.  - You can also use alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Use a dime size amount and rub all over your hands until they are dry.    To further prevent colds:  - Stay home when you are sick.  - Cough or sneeze into a tissue or into the crease of your elbow and not into the air.  - Keep your vaccinations up to date.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002145.htm
Answer: Despite the popular belief that vitamin C can cure the common cold, researchabout this claim is conflicting.  Large doses of vitamin C may help reduce how long a cold lasts, but they do not appear to protect against gettinga cold. This is true even after being exposed to the virus that causes colds.  Taking a vitamin C supplement may help treat a cold only if your bodycurrently has low levels of this vitamin. For example, people who live in cold climates may have low levels of vitamin C, sotaking a vitamin Csupplement may help keep this group of peoplefrom getting colds.This is also truefor people who routinely do vigorous exercise, such as running marathons.  The likelihood of success may vary from person to person. Some people improve, while others do not. People with kidney disease should not take vitamin C supplements.   Taking more than 500 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C at any one time is not helpful. More than that amount is simply lost by our body not absorbing it all or through urination.  Most experts advise that you should eat a balanced diet toget your daily vitamin and mineral requirements.)

Answer: Sneezing, sore throat, a stuffy nose, coughing - everyone knows the symptoms of the common cold. It is probably the most common illness. In the course of a year, people in the United States suffer 1 billion colds.    You can get a cold by touching your eyes or nose after you touch surfaces with cold germs on them. You can also inhale the germs. Symptoms usually begin 2 or 3 days after infection and last 2 to 14 days. Washing your hands and staying away from people with colds will help you avoid colds.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001956.htm
Answer: Summary : Your health care provider may give you a prescription in different ways, including:   - Writing a paper prescription that you take to a local pharmacy  - Calling or e-mailing a pharmacy to order the medicine  - Sending your prescription to the pharmacy by way of a computer that is linked to the provider's electronic medical record (EMR)    You also need to find out if your health plan will pay for the medicine your provider prescribed.   - Certain types or brands of medicine may not be covered.  - Many health plans require you to pay the pharmacy a portion of the cost of the prescription price. This called a co-pay.    Once you get a prescription from your provider, you may buy the medicine in different ways.   LOCAL PHARMACIES   The most common place for filling a prescription is at a local pharmacy. Some pharmacies are located inside of a grocery or large ""chain"" store.   It is best to fill all prescriptions with the same pharmacy. That way, the pharmacy has a record of all the medicines you are taking. This helps prevent drug interactions.   Your health plan may require you to use certain pharmacies. This means they may not pay for your prescription if you do not use one of these pharmacies. To find a pharmacy that takes your health plan:  - Call the phone number on the back of your insurance card.  - Call the pharmacy you want to use to see if they have a contract with your insurance plan.    To help the pharmacist fill the prescription:   - Make sure all of the information is filled in clearly.  - Bring your insurance card the first time you fill the prescription.  - When calling the pharmacy for a refill, make sure to give your name, the prescription number, and the name of the medicine.    MAIL-ORDER PHARMACIES   Some people and insurance companies choose to use mail-order pharmacies.   - The prescription is sent to the mail-order pharmacy or phoned in by the provider.  - Your medicine may cost less when you order it by mail. However, it may take a week or more for the medicine to get to you.  - Mail order is best used for long-term medicines you use for chronic problems.  - Buy short-term medicines and drugs that need to be stored at certain temperatures at a local pharmacy.    INTERNET (ONLINE) PHARMACIES   Internet pharmacies can be used for long-term medicines and medical supplies.   - The website should have clear directions for filling or transferring your prescription.  - Make sure that the website has clearly-stated privacy policies and other procedures.  - AVOID any website that claims a doctor can prescribe the medicine without seeing you.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000313.htm
Answer: Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy.   When you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy.  When sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes usually develops slowly over time. Most people with the disease are overweight or obese when they are diagnosed. Increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way.  Type 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are thin. This is more common in older adults.  Family history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. Low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease.)

Answer: After many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems:  - You could have eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), and light sensitivity. You could become blind.  - Your feet and skin can develop sores and infections. After a long time, your foot or leg may need to be amputated. Infection can also cause pain and itching in other parts of the body.  - Diabetes may make it harder to control your blood pressure and cholesterol. This can lead to a heart attack, stroke, and other problems.

Answer: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic (lifelong) disease. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body has trouble using the insulin it normally makes. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas to control blood sugar. When your body's insulin is not used correctly, the sugar from food stays in the blood and the level can get too high. Over time, people with type 2 diabetes may not have enough insulin.  Most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight when they are diagnosed. Type 2 diabetes usually happens slowly.

ADAM_0004354_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about 10 ways to cut 500 calories a day (Also called: Weight loss - 500 calories; Overweight - 500 calories; Obesity - 500 calories; Diet - 500 calories)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000892.htm
Answer: Summary : No matter what type of diet you follow, to lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you take in each day. For most overweight people, cutting about 500 calories a day is a good place to start. If you can eat 500 fewer calories every day, you should lose about a pound a week.

How to Cut Calories : Try these ten ways to cut 500 calories every day. It is easier than you may think.  - Swap your snack. Many people reach for a snack or two in between meals. Snacking is fine, just be sure to choose lower-calorie options. The key is to have some healthy snacks ready when hunger hits. Instead of a 3-ounce bag of flavored tortilla chips (425 calories), choose a cup of air-popped popcorn (31 calories), a cup of grapes (100 calories) or a small apple (77 calories). Choosing healthy snacks twice a day will save you 500 calories.  - Cut one high-calorie treat. Try to nix one high-calorie food item each day. Whether it is a donut in the morning, a brownie or bag of chips at lunch, or chocolate cake after dinner, you will save 250 to 350 calories or more. To burn another 150 calories take a 40-minute brisk walk after lunch or dinner.  - DO NOT drink your calories. One 12-ounce regular soda has about 150 calories, and a 16-ounce flavored latte can pack 250 or more. Even fruit smoothies have lots of calories, as many as 400 in a 16-ounce serving. A couple of sweet drinks a day can easily add up to 500 calories or more. Choose water, sparkling water, or black coffee or tea instead and save your calories for foods that will help you feel full.  - Skip seconds. Taking a second helpings can add up to unwanted calories. It is easy to keep filling your plate when you serve food family style on the table. Instead, fill your plate once and keep extras in the kitchen. Or, if you still do not feel satisfied, add a second helping of vegetables, fruit, or salad.  - Make skinny substitutions. Substitute lower-calorie options for some of your high-calorie favorites. For example, if a recipe calls for a cup of sour cream (444 calories) or heavy cream (821 calories), use plain low-fat yogurt instead (154 calories).  - Ask for a doggie bag. The portions at most restaurants are much larger than actual serving sizes. Instead of cleaning your whole plate, ask the server to put half in a container for you to take home for another meal. You can also share an entre with a friend, or make a meal out of an appetizer and a large salad. Just be sure to go easy on the dressing and high calorie toppings.  - Just say ""no"" to fried food. Frying food adds lots of unhealthy calories to any dish. Instead of fried chicken or fish, choose grilled, broiled, or poached instead. And skip the French fries. A large serving of fries alone can add almost 500 calories to a meal. Instead, see if you can substitute for the vegetable of the day or a side salad.  - Build a thinner pizza. Skip the meat toppings, extra cheese, and deep-dish crust, and have a couple slices of thin-crust vegetable pizza instead. You will save a little over 500 calories.  - Use a plate. Eat all food from a plate or bowl, including snacks. When you snack out of a bag or box, it is easy to eat more than you intend to. This is especially true if you are sitting in front of the TV. You may be surprised to learn that a large bag of chips will run more than 1,000 calories. Instead, place one portion in a bowl, and put the rest away.  - Avoid alcohol. Cutting back on alcohol is an easy way for many people to trim calories. Alcohol does not have any nutritional value, so when you imbibedrink alcohol, you are getting empty calories, up to 500 for some mixed drinks made with syrupy sweeteners, fruit juices, and ice cream or heavy cream. If you do order a drink, choose a 12-ounce light beer (103 calories) or a 5-ounce glass of wine (120 calories).)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/diabetestype2.html
Answer: Diabetes means your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth.    You have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if you are older, obese, have a family history of diabetes, or do not exercise. Having prediabetes also increases your risk. Prediabetes means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes.    The symptoms of type 2 diabetes appear slowly. Some people do not notice symptoms at all. The symptoms can include       - Being very thirsty    - Urinating often    - Feeling very hungry or tired    - Losing weight without trying    - Having sores that heal slowly    - Having blurry eyesight       Blood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test, the A1C, can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Many people can manage their diabetes through healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing. Some people also need to take diabetes medicines.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)

MPlusDrugs_0000558_Sec2.txt,"Question: Who should get Glyburide and Metformin and why is it prescribed ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a699055.html
Answer: The combination of glyburide and metformin is used to treat type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) in people whose diabetes cannot be controlled by diet and exercise alone. Glyburide belongs to a class of drugs called sulfonylureas, and metformin is in a class of drugs called biguanides. Glyburide lowers blood sugar by causing the pancreas to produce insulin (a natural substance that is needed to break down sugar in the body) and helping the body use insulin efficiently. This medication will only help lower blood sugar in people whose bodies produce insulin naturally. Metformin helps your body control the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. It decreases the amount of glucose you absorb from your food and the amount of glucose made by your liver. It also helps your body use its own insulin more effectively. Glyburide and metformin are not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may occur if high blood sugar is not treated).)

Answer: Glyburide and metformin combination comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken one to two times daily with meals. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take glyburide and metformin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of glyburide and metformin and may gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 2 weeks. depending on your response. Monitor your blood glucose closely.  Glyburide and metformin combination controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to take glyburide and metformin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking glyburide and metformin without talking to your doctor.  Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a696005.html
Answer: Metformin may rarely cause a serious, life-threatening condition called lactic acidosis. Tell your doctor if you are over 80 years old and if you have ever had a heart attack; stroke; diabetic ketoacidosis (blood sugar that is high enough to cause severe symptoms and requires emergency medical treatment) or coma; or heart, kidney, or liver disease.  Tell your doctor if you have recently had any of the following conditions, or if you develop them during treatment: serious infection; severe diarrhea, vomiting, or fever; or if you drink much less fluid than usual for any reason. You may have to stop taking metformin until you recover.  If you are having surgery, including dental surgery, any x-ray procedure in which dye is injected, or any major medical procedure, tell the doctor that you are taking metformin. You may need to stop taking metformin before the procedure and wait 48 hours to restart treatment. Your doctor will tell you exactly when you should stop taking metformin and when you should start taking it again.  If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking metformin and call your doctor immediately: extreme tiredness, weakness, or discomfort; nausea; vomiting; stomach pain; decreased appetite; deep and rapid breathing or shortness of breath; dizziness; lightheadedness; fast or slow heartbeat; flushing of the skin; muscle pain; or feeling cold.  Tell your doctor if you regularly drink alcohol or sometimes drink large amounts of alcohol in a short time (binge drinking). Drinking alcohol increases your risk of developing lactic acidosis or may cause a decrease in blood sugar. Ask your doctor how much alcohol is safe to drink while you are taking metformin.  Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests to check your body's response to metformin. Talk to your doctor about the risk(s) of taking metformin.)

Answer: Metformin is used alone or with other medications, including insulin, to treat type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Metformin is in a class of drugs called biguanides. Metformin helps to control the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. It decreases the amount of glucose you absorb from your food and the amount of glucose made by your liver. Metformin also increases your body's response to insulin, a natural substance that controls the amount of glucose in the blood. Metformin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood).  Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a696005.html
Answer: Metformin comes as a liquid, a tablet, and an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The liquid is usually taken with meals one or two times a day. The regular tablet is usually taken with meals two or three times a day. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once daily with the evening meal. To help you remember to take metformin, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take metformin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Swallow metformin extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.  Your doctor may start you on a low dose of metformin and gradually increase your dose not more often than once every 12 weeks. You will need to monitor your blood sugar carefully so your doctor will be able to tell how well metformin is working.  Metformin controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to take metformin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking metformin without talking to your doctor.

ADAM_0001480_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Exercise and age (Also called: Age and exercise)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002080.htm
Answer: Summary : It is never too late to start exercising. Exercise has benefits at any age.  Don't worry if you have never exercised, or if you stopped exercising for some reason. Being physically active can help youto keep doingthe things you enjoy and stay independent as you age. The right kind of regular exercise can also reduce yourriskof heart disease, diabetes, and falls.  An effective exercise program needs to be fun and helps to keep you motivated. It helps to have a goal. Your goal might be to:  - Manage a health condition  - Reduce stress  - Improve your stamina  - Be able to buy clothes in a smaller size   Your exercise program mayalso be a way for you to socialize. Taking exercise classes or exercising with a friend are both good ways to be social.  You may have a hard time starting an exercise routine. Once you do start, though, you will begin to notice the benefits, including improved sleep and self-esteem.  Exercise and physical activity can also:  - Improve or maintain your strength and fitness  - Make it easier to do the things you want to do  - Help your balance and walking  - Help with feelings of depression or anxiety and improve your mood  - Maintain your thinking skills (cognitive function) as you get older  - Prevent or treat diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, breast and colon cancer, and osteoporosis   Always talk to your health care provider before starting an exercise program.Your provider can suggest exercises and activities that are right for you.  Exercises can be grouped into four main categories, although many exercises fit into more than one category:  AEROBIC EXERCISE   Aerobic exercise increases your breathing and heart rate. These exercises help your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. They may prevent or delay many diseases, such as diabetes, colon and breast cancers, and heart disease.  - Aerobic sports activities include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, biking, climbing, tennis, and basketball  - Aerobic activities you can do every day include dancing, yard work, pushing your grandchild on a swing, and vacuuming   MUSCLE STRENGTH  Improving your muscle strength can help you climb stairs, carry groceries, and stay independent. You can build muscle strength by:  - Lifting weights or using a resistance band  - Performing everyday activities, such as carrying a full laundry basket from the basement, carrying your smaller grandchildren, or lifting things in the garden    BALANCE EXERCISES  Balance exercises help prevent falls, which is a concern for older adults. Many exercises that strengthen the muscles in the legs, hips, and lower back will improve your balance. It is often best to learn balance exercises from a physical therapist before starting on your own.  Balance exercises may include:  - Standing on one foot  - Walking heel-to-toe  - Tai chi  - Standing on tiptoe to reach something on the top shelf  - Walking up and down the stairs    STRETCHING  Stretching can help your body stay flexible. To stay limber:  - Learn shoulder, upper arm, and calf stretches  - Take yoga classes  - Do everyday activities, such as making your bed or bending over to tie your shoes)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002367.htm
Answer: Summary : Gestation is the period of time between conception and birth. During this time, the baby grows and develops inside the mother's womb.  Gestational age is the common term used during pregnancy to describe how far along the pregnancy is. It is measured in weeks, from the first day of the woman's last menstrual cycle to the current date. A normal pregnancy can range from 38 to 42 weeks.  Infants born before 37 weeks are considered premature. Infants born after 42 weeks are considered postmature.

Information : Gestational age can be determined before or after birth.  Before birth, your doctor will use ultrasound to measure the size of the baby's head, abdomen, and thigh bone. This helps determine how well the baby is growing in the womb.   After birth, gestational age can be measured by looking at the baby's weight, length, head circumference, vital signs, reflexes, muscle tone, posture, and the condition of the skin and hair. The baby's developmental gestational age may not be the same as the calendar age. For example, an infant born at 36 weeks may actually have a developmental gestational age of 38 weeks. This baby may be more like a full-term infant than a baby born prematurely.  Determining a babys gestational age is important. It gives your doctor information that help set the babys medical treatment plan.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/age-related-macular-degeneration
Answer: Age-related macular degeneration is an eye disease that is a leading cause of vision loss in older people in developed countries. The vision loss usually becomes noticeable in a person's sixties or seventies and tends to worsen over time.  Age-related macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The vision loss in this condition results from a gradual deterioration of light-sensing cells in the tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color (the retina). Specifically, age-related macular degeneration affects a small area near the center of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for central vision. Side (peripheral) vision and night vision are generally not affected.  Researchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration, known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and slowly progressive vision loss. The condition typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other.  The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly. This form of the condition is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision appear blurry and distorted.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007603.htm
Answer: Why get vaccinated?  Measles, mumps, and rubella are serious diseases. Before vaccines they were very common, especially among children.  Measles  - Measles virus causes rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, and fever.  - It can lead to ear infection, pneumonia, seizures (jerking and staring), brain damage, and death.    Mumps  - Mumps virus causes fever, headache, muscle pain, loss of appetite, and swollen glands.  - It can lead to deafness, meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord covering), painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and rarely sterility.    Rubella (German Measles)  - Rubella virus causes rash, arthritis (mostly in women), and mild fever.  - If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage or her baby could be born with serious birth defects.    These diseases spread from person to person through the air. You can easily catch them by being around someone who is already infected.  Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine can protect children (and adults) from all three of these diseases.  Thanks to successful vaccination programs these diseases are much less common in the U.S. than they used to be. But if we stopped vaccinating they would return. Who should get MMR vaccine and when?  Children should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine:  - First Dose: 12 to 15 months of age  - Second Dose: 4 to 6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 28 days after the 1st dose)    Some infants younger than 12 months should get a dose of MMR if they are traveling out of the country. (This dose will not count toward their routine series.)  Some adults should also get MMR vaccine: Generally, anyone 18 years of age or older who was born after 1956 should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine, unless they can show that they have either been vaccinated or had all three diseases.  MMR vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines.  Children between 1 and 12 years of age can get a ""combination"" vaccine called MMRV, which contains both MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines. There is a separate Vaccine Information Statement for MMRV. Some people should not get MMR vaccine or should wait.  - Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.  - Anyone who had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of MMR or MMRV vaccine should not get another dose.  - Some people who are sick at the time the shot is scheduled may be advised to wait until they recover before getting MMR vaccine.  - Pregnant women should not get MMR vaccine. Pregnant women who need the vaccine should wait until after giving birth. Women should avoid getting pregnant for 4 weeks after vaccination with MMR vaccine.  - Tell your doctor if the person getting the vaccine:        - Has HIV/AIDS, or another disease that affects the immune system    - Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids    - Has any kind of cancer    - Is being treated for cancer with radiation or drugs    - Has ever had a low platelet count (a blood disorder)    - Has gotten another vaccine within the past 4 weeks    - Has recently had a transfusion or received other blood products    - Any of these might be a reason to not get the vaccine, or delay vaccination until later.      What are the risks from MMR vaccine?  A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions.  The risk of MMR vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.  Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps or rubella.  Most people who get MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with it.  Mild problems  - Fever (up to 1 person out of 6)  - Mild rash (about 1 person out of 20)  - Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (about 1 person out of 75)    If these problems occur, it is usually within 6-14 days after the shot. They occur less often after the second dose.  Moderate problems  - Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (about 1 out of 3,000 doses)  - Temporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women (up to 1 out of 4)  - Temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder (about 1 out of 30,000 doses)    Severe problems (very rare)   - Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses)  - Several other severe problems have been reported after a child gets MMR vaccine, including:        - Deafness    - Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness    - Permanent brain damage       These are so rare that it is hard to tell whether they are caused by the vaccine. What if there is a serious reaction?  What should I look for?  - Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.    Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.   What should I do?  - If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.  - Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS website or by calling 1-800-822-7967.    VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program  The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines.

Answer: Measles, Mumps, Rubella & Varicella  Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella (chickenpox) can be serious diseases:  Measles  - Causes rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, fever.  - Can lead to ear infection, pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, and death.    Mumps  - Causes fever, headache, swollen glands.  - Can lead to deafness, meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord covering), infection of the pancreas, painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and, rarely, death.    Rubella (German Measles)  - Causes rash and mild fever; and can cause arthritis, (mostly in women).  - If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage or her baby could be born with serious birth defects.    Varicella (Chickenpox)  - Causes rash, itching, fever, tiredness.  - Can lead to severe skin infection, scars, pneumonia, brain damage, or death.  - Can re-emerge years later as a painful rash called shingles.    These diseases can spread from person to person through the air. Varicella can also be spread through contact with fluid from chickenpox blisters.  Before vaccines, these diseases were very common in the United States. MMRV Vaccine  MMRV vaccine may be given to children from 1 through 12 years of age to protect them from these four diseases.  Two doses of MMRV vaccine are recommended:  - The first dose at 12 through 15 months of age  - The second dose at 4 through 6 years of age    These are recommended ages. But children can get the second dose up through 12 years as long as it is at least 3 months after the first dose.  Children may also get these vaccines as 2 separate shots: MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) and varicella vaccines.  1 Shot (MMRV) or 2 Shots (MMR & Varicella)?  - Both options give the same protection.  - One less shot with MMRV.  - Children who got the first dose as MMRV have had more fevers and fever-related seizures (about 1 in 1,250) than children who got the first dose as separate shots of MMR and varicella vaccines on the same day (about 1 in 2,500).    Your doctor can give you more information, including the Vaccine Information Statements for MMR and Varicella vaccines.  Anyone 13 or older who needs protection from these diseases should get MMR and varicella vaccines as separate shots.  MMRV may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Some children should not get MMRV vaccine or should wait.  Children should not get MMRV vaccine if they:  - Have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of MMRV vaccine, or to either MMR or varicella vaccine.  - Have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine, including gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin. Tell the doctor if your child has any severe allergies.  - Have HIV/AIDS, or another disease that affects the immune system.  - Are being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, including high doses of oral steroids for 2 weeks or longer.  - Have any kind of cancer  - Are being treated for cancer with radiation or drugs    Check with your doctor if the child:  - Has a history of seizures, or has a parent, brother or sister with a history of seizures.  - Has a parent, brother or sister with a history of immune system problems.  - Has ever had a low platelet count, or another blood disorder.  - Recently had a transfusion or received other blood products.  - Might be pregnant.    Children who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting MMRV vaccine. Children who are only mildly ill may usually get the vaccine.  Ask your doctor for more information. What are the risks from MMRV vaccine?

If these problems happen, it is usually within 5 to 12 days after the first dose. They happen less often after the second dose.  Moderate problems  - Seizure caused by fever (about 1 child in 1,250 who get MMRV), usually 5 to 12 days after the first dose. They happen less often when MMR and varicella vaccines are given at the same visit as separate shots (about 1 child in 2,500 who get these two vaccines), and rarely after a 2nd dose of MMRV.  - Temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder (about 1 child out of 40,000).    Severe problems (very rare)  Several severe problems have been reported following MMR vaccine, and might also happen after MMRV. These include severe allergic reactions (fewer than 4 per million), and problems such as:  - Deafness.  - Long-term seizures, coma, lowered consciousness.  - Permanent brain damage.    Because these problems occur so rarely, we can't be sure whether they are caused by the vaccine or not. What if there is a serious reaction?

MPlusDrugs_0000814_Sec1.txt,"Question: Why get vaccinated with MMR Vaccine (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601176.html
Answer: Measles, mumps, and rubella are serious diseases. Before vaccines they were very common, especially among children.  - Measles virus causes rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, and fever.  - It can lead to ear infection, pneumonia, seizures (jerking and staring), brain damage, and death.   - Mumps virus causes fever, headache, muscle pain, loss of appetite, and swollen glands.  - It can lead to deafness, meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord covering), painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and rarely sterility.   - Rubella virus causes rash, arthritis (mostly in women), and mild fever.  - If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage or her baby could be born with serious birth defects.   These diseases spread from person to person through the air. You can easily catch them by being around someone who is already infected.  Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine can protect children (and adults) from all three of these diseases.  Thanks to successful vaccination programs these diseases are much less common in the U.S. than they used to be. But if we stopped vaccinating they would return.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601176.html
Answer: should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine:   - First Dose: 12 to 15 months of age  - Second Dose: 4 to 6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 28 days after the 1st dose)   Some infants younger than 12 months should get a dose of MMR if they are traveling out of the country. (This dose will not count toward their routine series.)  Some adults should also get MMR vaccine: Generally, anyone 18 years of age or older who was born after 1956 should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine, unless they can show that they have either been vaccinated or had all three diseases.  MMR vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines.  Children between 1 and 12 years of age can get a combination vaccine called MMRV, which contains both MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines. There is a separate Vaccine Information Statement for MMRV.)

Answer: - Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.  - Anyone who had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of MMR or MMRV vaccine should not get another dose.  - Some people who are sick at the time the shot is scheduled may be advised to wait until they recover before getting MMR vaccine.  - Pregnant women should not get MMR vaccine. Pregnant women who need the vaccine should wait until after giving birth. Women should avoid getting pregnant for 4 weeks after vaccination with MMR vaccine.  Tell your doctor if the person getting the vaccine:   - Has HIV/AIDS, or another disease that affects the immune system  - Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids  - Has any kind of cancer  - Is being treated for cancer with radiation or drugs  - Has ever had a low platelet count (a blood disorder)  - Has gotten another vaccine within the past 4 weeks  - Has recently had a transfusion or received other blood products   Any of these might be a reason to not get the vaccine, or delay vaccination until later.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601176.html
Answer: A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions.  The risk of MMR vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.  Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps or rubella.  Most people who get MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with it.  - Fever (up to 1 person out of 6)  - Mild rash (about 1 person out of 20)  - Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (about 1 person out of 75)   If these problems occur, it is usually within 6 to 14 days after the shot. They occur less often after the second dose.  - Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (about 1 out of 3,000 doses)  - Temporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women (up to 1 out of 4)  - Temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder (about 1 out of 30,000 doses)   - Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses)  - Several other severe problems have been reported after a child gets MMR vaccine, including: Deafness; long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness; permanent brain damage. These are so rare that it is hard to tell whether they are caused by the vaccine.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000768.htm
Answer: The cause of primary brain tumors is unknown. Primary brain tumors may be:  - Not cancerous (benign)  - Invasive (spread to nearby areas)  - Cancerous (malignant)    Brain tumors are classified based on:  - The exact site of the tumor  - The type of tissue involved  - Whether it is cancerous    Brain tumors can directly destroy brain cells. They can also indirectly damage cells by pushing on other parts of the brain. This leads to swelling and increased pressure inside the skull.  Tumors can occur at any age. Many tumors are more common at a certain age. In general, brain tumors in children are very rare.  COMMON TUMOR TYPES  Astrocytomas are usually noncancerous, slow-growing tumors. They commonly develop in children ages 5 to 8. Also called low-grade gliomas, these are the most common brain tumors in children.  Medulloblastomas are the most common type of childhood brain cancer. Most medulloblastomas occur before age 10.  Ependymomas are a type of childhood brain tumor that can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The location and type of ependymoma determine the type of therapy needed to control the tumor.  Brainstem gliomas are very rare tumors that occur almost only in children. The average age at which they develop is about 6. The tumor may grow very large before causing symptoms.)

Answer: Symptoms may be subtle and only gradually become worse, or they may occur very quickly.  Headaches are often the most common symptom. But only very rarely do children with headaches have a tumor. Headache patterns that may occur with brain tumors include:  - Headaches that are worse when waking up in the morning and go away within a few hours  - Headaches that get worse with coughing or exercise, or with a change in body position  - Headaches that occur while sleeping and with at least one other symptom such as vomiting or confusion    Sometimes, the only symptoms of brain tumors are mental changes, which may include:  - Changes in personality and behavior  - Unable to concentrate  - Increased sleep  - Memory loss  - Problems with reasoning    Other possible symptoms are:  - Gradual loss of movement or feeling in an arm or leg  - Hearing loss with or without dizziness  - Speech difficulty  - Unexpected vision problem (especially if it occurs with a headache), including vision loss (usually of peripheral vision) in one or both eyes, or double vision  - Problems with balance  - Weakness or numbness)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000768.htm
Answer: Treatment depends on the size and type of tumor and the child's general health. The goals of treatment may be to cure the tumor, relieve symptoms, and improve brain function or the child's comfort.  Surgery is needed for most primary brain tumors. Some tumors may be completely removed. In cases where the tumor cannot be removed, surgery may help reduce pressure and relieve symptoms. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be used for certain tumors.  The following are treatments for specific types of tumors:  - Astrocytoma: Surgery to remove the tumor is the main treatment. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also be necessary.  - Brainstem gliomas: Surgery is usually not possible because of the tumor's location deep in the brain. Radiation is used to shrink the tumor and prolong life.  - Ependymomas: Treatment includes surgery. Radiation and chemotherapy may be necessary.  - Medulloblastomas: Surgery alone does not cure this type of tumor. Chemotherapy with or without radiation is often used in combination with surgery.    Medicines used to treat primary brain tumors in children include:  - Corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling  - Diuretics (water pills) to reduce brain swelling and pressure  - Anticonvulsants to reduce or prevent seizures  - Pain medicines    Comfort measures, safety measures, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other such steps may be required to improve quality of life.)

ADAM_0001041_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Crying - excessive (0 to 6 months) (Also called: Excessive crying (infants 0 to 6 months))
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003023.htm
Answer: Summary : Infants normally cry about 1 to 3 hours a day. It is perfectly normal for an infant to cry when hungry, thirsty, tired, lonely, or in pain. It is also normal for a baby to have a fussy period in the evening.  But, if an infant cries too often, it may be a sign of something that needs treatment.

Causes : Infants may cry because of any of the following:  - Boredom or loneliness  - Colic  - Discomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or feeling cold  - Hunger or thirst  - Illness  - Infection (a likely cause if the crying is accompanied by irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, or fever. You should call your baby's health care provider)  - Medicines  - Normal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep  - Pain  - Teething

Home Care : Home care depends on the causes. Follow your provider's advice.   If the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.  If crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.  Take your baby's temperature to check for fever. Check your baby head-to-toe for any injuries. Pay particular attention to the fingers, toes, and genitalia. It is not uncommon for a hair to get wrapped around part of your baby, such as a toe, creating pain.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Call the provider if:  - A baby's excessive crying remains unexplained and does not go away in 1 day, despite attempts at home treatment  - The baby has other symptoms, such as fever, along with the excessive crying

What to Expect at Your Office Visit : The provider will examine your baby and ask about the child's medical history and symptoms. Questions may include:  - Is the child teething?  - Is the child bored, lonely, hungry, thirsty?  - Does the child seem to have a lot of gas?  - What other symptoms does the child have? Such as, difficulty waking up, fever, irritability, poor appetite, or vomiting?    The provider will check the infant's growth and development. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the baby has a bacterial infection.)

ADAM_0001562_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Feeding patterns and diet - children 6 months to 2 years
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000713.htm
Answer: Summary : An age-appropriate diet:  - Gives your child proper nutrition  - Is right for your child's state of development  - Can help prevent childhood obesity

Recommendations : 6 to 8 MONTHS  At this age, your baby will probably eat about 4 to 6 times per day, but will eat more at each feeding than the first 6 months.  - If you feed formula, your baby will eat about 6 to 8 ounces per feeding, but should not have more than 32 ounces in 24 hours.  - You can start to introduce solid foods at age 6 months. Most of your baby's calories should still come from breast milk or formula.  - Breast milk is not a good source of iron. So after 6 months, your baby will start to need more iron in their diet. Start solid feedings with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula. Mix it with enough milk so that the texture is very thin. Start by offering the cereal 2 times a day, in just a few spoonfuls.  - You can make the mixture thicker as your baby learns to control it in her mouth.  - You can also introduce iron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables. Try green peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, pears, bananas, and peaches.  - Some dietitians recommend introducing a few vegetables before fruits. The sweetness of fruit may make some vegetables less appealing.  - The amount your child eats will vary between 2 tablespoons and 2 cups of fruits and vegetables per day. How much your child eats depends on their size and how well they eat fruits and vegetables.    There are several ways you can tell that your baby is ready to eat solid foods:  - Your baby's birth weight has doubled.  - Your baby can control their head and neck movements.  - Your baby can sit up with some support.  - Your baby can show you they are full by turning their head away or by not opening their mouth.  - Your baby begins showing interest in food when others are eating.    You should also know:  - Never give honey to your baby. It may contain bacteria that can cause botulism, a rare but serious illness.  - DO NOT give your baby cow's milk until they are 1 year old. Babies under age 1 have a difficult time digesting cow's milk.  - Never put your child to bed with a bottle. This can cause tooth decay. If your baby wants to suck, give them a pacifier.  - Use a small spoon when feeding your baby.  - It is fine to start to give your baby water between feedings.  - DO NOT give your baby cereal in a bottle unless your pediatrician or dietitian recommends it, for example, for reflux.  - Only offer your child new foods when they are hungry.  - Introduce new foods one at a time, waiting 2 to 3 days between. That way you can watch for allergic reactions. Signs of an allergy include diarrhea, rash, or vomiting.  - Avoid foods with added salt or sugar.  - Feed your baby directly from the jar only if you use the entire jar contents. Otherwise, use a dish to prevent food-borne illness.  - Opened containers of baby's food should be covered and stored in a refrigerator for no longer than 2 days.    8 to 12 MONTHS OF AGE  At this age, you can offer finger foods in small amounts. Your baby will probably let you know they are ready to start feeding themselves by grabbing the food or spoon with their hand.  Good finger foods include:  - Soft cooked vegetables  - Washed and peeled fruits  - Graham crackers  - Melba toast  - Noodles    You can also introduce teething foods, such as:  - Toast strips  - Unsalted crackers and bagels  - Teething biscuits    Continue to offer your baby breast milk or formula 3 to 4 times per day at this age.  You should also know:  - Avoid foods that may cause choking, such as apple chunks or slices, grapes, berries, raisins, dry flake cereals, hot dogs, sausages, peanut butter, popcorn, nuts, seeds, round candies, and raw vegetables.  - You can give your child egg yolks 3 to 4 times per week. Some babies are sensitive to egg whites. So DO NOT offer them until after age 1.  - You can offer small amounts of cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt, but no cow's milk.  - By age 1, most children are off the bottle. If your child still uses a bottle, it should contain water only.    1 YEARof AGE  - At this age, you may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula.  - Most mothers in the U.S. wean their babies by this age. But it is also fine to continue to nurse if you and your baby want to.  - DO NOT give your child low-fat milk (2%, 1%, or skim) until after age 2. Your baby needs the extra calories from fat to grow and develop.  - At this age, your baby will get most of their nutrition from proteins, fruits and vegetables, breads and grains, and dairy. You can make sure your baby gets all the vitamins and minerals they need by offering a variety of foods.  - Your child will start to crawl and walk and be much more active. They will eat smaller amounts at a time, but will eat more often (4 to 6 times a day). Having snacks on hand is a good idea.  - At this age, their growing slows. They will not double in size like they did when they were an infant.    You should also know:  - If your child dislikes a new food, try giving it again later. Often it takes several tries for children to take to new foods.  - DO NOT give your child sweets or sweetened beverages. They can spoil their appetite and cause tooth decay.  - Avoid salt, strong spices, and caffeine products, including soft drinks, coffee, tea, and chocolate.  - If your baby is fussy, they may need attention, rather than food.    2 YEARS of AGE  - After your child turns 2, your child's diet should be moderately low in fat. A high-fat diet can lead to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems later in life.  - Your child should eat a variety of foods from each of the food groups: breads and grains, proteins, fruits and vegetables, and dairy.  - If your water is not fluoridated, it is a good idea to use toothpaste or mouthwash with fluoride added.    All children need plenty of calcium to support their growing bones. But not all kids get enough. Good sources of calcium include:  - Low-fat or nonfat milk, yogurt, and cheese  - Cooked greens  - Canned salmon (with bones)    If your child's diet is balanced and healthy, they should not need a vitamin supplement. Some kids are picky eaters, but usually they still get all the nutrients they need. If you are concerned, ask your health care provider whether your child needs a children's multivitamin.

When to Call Your Child's Health Care Provider : Call the provider if you are concerned your child:  - Is not eating enough  - Is eating too much  - Is gaining too much or too little weight  - Has an allergic reaction to food)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007670.htm
Answer: There is no drug treatment for hepatitis A. Your child's immune system will fight the virus. Managing the symptoms can help your child feel better while recovering:  - Have your child rest when symptoms are the worst.  - DO NOT give acetaminophen to your child without first talking with your child's provider. It can be toxic because the liver is already weak.  - Give your child fluids in the form of fruit juices or electrolyte solutions, such as Pedialyte. This helps prevent dehydration.   While rare, symptoms may be severe enough that children with HAV need extra fluids througha vein (IV).)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007671.htm
Answer: Acute hepatitis B does not need any special treatment. Your child's immune system will fight the disease. If there is no sign of the HBV infection after 6 months, then your child has recovered fully. However, while the virus is present, your child can pass the virus to others. You should take steps to help prevent the disease from spreading.  Chronic hepatitis B needs treatment. The goal of treatment is to relieve any symptoms, prevent the disease from spreading, and help prevent liver disease. Make sure that your child:  - Gets plenty of rest  - Drinks lots of fluids  - Eats healthy foods   Your child's provider also may recommend antiviral medicines. The medicines decrease or remove HBV from the blood:  - Interferon alpha-2b (Intron A) can be given to children age 1 and older.  - Lamivudine (Epivir) and entecavir (Baraclude) are used in children age 2 and older.  - Tenofovir (Viread) is given to children age 12 and older.   It is not always clear what medicines should be given.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007672.htm
Answer: The main aim of treatment in children is to relieve the symptoms and stop the disease from spreading. If your child has symptoms, make sure that your child:  - Gets plenty of rest  - Drinks lots of fluids  - Eats healthy food   Acute hepatitis C does not need any special treatment. However, your child can pass the virus to others. You should take steps to help prevent the disease from spreading.  Chronic hepatitis C needs treatment. The goal of treatment is to prevent complications.  If there is no sign of the HCV infection after 6 months, then your child has fully recovered. However, if your child develops chronic hepatitis C, it can cause liver disease later in life.  Your child's provider may recommend antiviral medicines for chronic HCV. These medicines:  - Have fewer side effects  - Are easier to take  - Are taken by mouth   The choice of whether to use medicines in children for hepatitis C is not clear. Medicines that have been used, interferon and ribavirin, carry a lot of side effects and some risks. Newer and safer medicines have been approved for adults, but not yet for children. Many experts recommend waiting on treatment of HCV in children until these newer medicines are approved for use in children.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000958.htm
Answer: The child will first be stabilized. A tube will be passed into the stomach through the nose (nasogastric tube). An intravenous (IV) line will be placed in the arm, and fluids will be given to prevent dehydration.  In some cases, the bowel blockage can be treated with an air or contrast enema. This is done by a radiologist skilled with the procedure. There is a risk of bowel tearing (perforation) with this procedure.   The child will need surgery if these treatments do not work. The bowel tissue can very often be saved. Dead tissue will be removed.  Antibiotics may be needed to treat any infection.  Intravenous feeding and fluids will be continued until the child has a normal bowel movement.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007508.htm
Answer: SUPPORTING YOUR CHILD  The first step in helping your child get to a healthy weight is to talk to the childs health care provider. The provider can help to set healthy goals for weight lossand help with monitoring and support.  Try to get the whole family to join in making healthy behavior changes. Weight-loss plans for children focus on healthy lifestyle habits. A healthy lifestyle is good for everyone, even if weight loss is not the main goal.  Having support from friends and family can also help your child lose weight.   CHANGING YOUR CHILD'S LIFESTYLE  Eating a balanced diet means you child consumes the right types and amounts of foods and drinks to keep their body healthy.  - Know the right portion sizes for your child's age so your child gets enough nutrition without overeating.  - Shop for healthy foods and make them available to your child.  - Choose a variety of healthy foods from each of the food groups. Eat foods from each group at every meal.  - Learn more about eating healthy and eating out.  - Choosing healthy snacks and drinks for your children is important.  - Fruits and vegetables are good choices for healthy snacks. They are full of vitamins and low in calories and fat. Some crackers and cheeses also make good snacks.  - Limit junk-food snacks like chips, candy, cake, cookies, and ice cream. The best way to keep kids from eating junk food or other unhealthy snacks is to not have these foods in your house.  - Avoid sodas, sport drinks, and flavored waters, especially ones made with sugar or corn syrup. These drinks are high in calories and can lead to weight gain. If needed, choose beverages with artificial (man-made) sweeteners.    Make sure children have a chance to engage in healthy physical activity every day.  - Experts recommendchildren get 60 minutes of moderate activity every day. Moderate activity means you breathe more deeply than when at rest and your heart beats faster than normal.  - If your child is not athletic, find ways to motivate your child to be more active.  - Encourage children to play, run, bike, and play sports during their free time.  - Children should not watch more than 2 hours oftelevision a day.    WHAT ELSE TO THINK ABOUT  Talk to your health care provider before giving weight loss supplements or herbal remedies to your child. Many claims made by these products are not true. Some supplements can have serious side effects.   Weight loss drugs are not recommended for children.  Bariatric surgery is currently being performed for some children, but only after they've stopped growing.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000505.htm
Answer: In children, UTIs should be treated quickly with antibiotics to protect the kidneys. Any child under 6 months old or who has other complications should see a specialist right away.  Younger infants will most often need to stay in the hospital and be given antibiotics through a vein. Older infants and children are treated with antibiotics by mouth. If this is not possible, they may need to get treated in the hospital.  Your child should drink plenty of fluids when being treated for a UTI.  Some children may be treated with antibiotics for periods as long as 6 months to 2 years. This treatment is more likely when the child has had repeat infections or vesicoureteral reflux.   After antibiotics are finished, your child's provider may ask you to bring your child back to do another urine test. This may be needed to make sure that bacteria are no longer in the bladder.)

ADAM_0004309_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about When your child's treatment stops working (Also called: End of life care - children; Palliative care - children; Advance care planning - children)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000852.htm
Answer: Summary : Sometimes even the best treatments are not enough to stop cancer. Your child's cancer may have become resistant to anti-cancer drugs. It may have come back or kept growing despite treatment. This can be a difficult time for you and your family as you make decisions about ongoing treatment and what comes next.

What it Means When Treatment Stops Working : It is not always clear when to stop treatment. If the first treatment did not work, doctors often try several different approaches. Usually the chance of success goes down with each new line of treatment. Your family and child's health care providers may need to decide whether further treatment is worth the side effects it causes your child, including pain and discomfort.

What Happens Next : If treatment is no longer working or you have decided to stop treatment, the focus of care will change from treating cancer to making sure your child is comfortable.  Even if there is no hope that the cancer will go away, some treatments can keep tumors from growing and reduce pain. Your child's health care team may talk to you about treatments to prevent unnecessary pain.   If you have not done so already, you will need to make some decisions about the end of your child's life. It is incredibly hard to even think about, but taking care of these issues can help you focus on making the best of the rest of your child's life. These include:  - What kinds of treatment to use to help your child stay comfortable.  - Whether or not to have a do not resuscitate order.  - Where you want your child to spend his final days. Some families are more comfortable in a hospital where a doctor is right around the corner. Other families feel better in the comfort of home. Each family has to make the decision that is right for them.  - How much to involve your child in decisions.

Support for You and Your Family : It may be the hardest thing you have to do but changing your focus from treating cancer to letting go can be the best thing for your child. You may be better able to understand what your child is going through, and what your child needs from you, if you are realistic about what is happening.   You do not have to figure this out on your own. Many hospitals and organizations have services to help children and parents cope with end-of-life issues.

How and When to Talk to Your Child : Children often know more than their parents think. They watch adults' behavior and listen to what they say. If you avoid difficult subjects, you could give your child the message that the topics are off limits. Your child may want to talk, but not want to upset you.  On the other hand, it is important not to push your child to talk if she is not ready.  Your child's behavior can give you some clues. If your child asks questions about death, it could be a sign that she wants to talk. If your child changes the subject or wants to play, your child may have had enough for now.  - If your child is young, consider using toys or art to talk about death. You may talk about what happens if a doll gets sick, or talk about a book about an animal that dies.  - Ask open-ended questions that give your child a chance to talk. ""What do you think happened to Grandma when she died?""  - Use direct language that your child will understand. Phrases like ""pass away"" or ""go to sleep"" may simply confuse your child.  - Let your child know that she will not be alone when she dies.  - Tell your child that the pain will go away when she dies.

How to Help Your Child : Your child's energy level will play a key role in how to spend the next weeks or months. If possible, keep your child involved in normal activities.  - Stick to routines like family meals, chores, and bedtime stories.  - Let your child be a child. This may mean watching TV, playing games, or sending texts.  - Encourage your child to stay in school if possible.  - Support your child's time with friends. Whether in person, on the phone, or online, your child might want to stay connected to others.  - Help your child set goals. Your child might want to take a trip or learn a new language. Your child's goals will depend on his interests.

Help Your Child Prepare : As sad as it is, there are ways you can help your child prepare to die. Let your child know what physical changes may happen. Your child's doctor may help you with this. While it is best not to include scary details, knowing what to expect can help your child feel less anxious.  - Create family memories. You might go through photos and create a web site or photo book together.  - Help your child say goodbye to special people in person or through letters.  - Let your child know what lasting impact he will leave behind. Whether it was being a good son and brother, or helping other people, tell your child how he has made the world a better place.  - Promise you will be ok when your child dies and will take care of the people and animals your child loves.

Answer: On this Page General Information about VISA/VRSA What is Staphylococcus aureus? How do VISA and VRSA get their names? What should a patient do if they suspect they have a Staph, MRSA, VISA, or VRSA infection? Are VISA and VRSA infections treatable? How can the spread of VISA and VRSA be prevented? What should a person do if a family member or close friend has VISA or VRSA? What is CDC doing to address VISA and VRSA? Recommendations and Guidelines General Information about VISA/VRSA For more images of this bacterium, search the Public Health Image Library Vancomycin [van−kō−mī−sin]-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus [staff−u−lu−kaw−kus  aw−ree−us] (also called VISA) and Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also called VRSA) are specific types of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. However, as of October 2010, all VISA and VRSA isolates have been susceptible to other Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Persons who develop this type of staph infection may have underlying health conditions (such as diabetes and kidney disease), tubes going into their bodies (such as catheters), previous infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and recent exposure to vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents. What is Staphylococcus aureus? Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of about 30% of individuals. Most of the time, staph does not cause any harm. These infections can look like pimples, boils, or other skin conditions and most are able to be treated. Sometimes staph bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause serious infections which can be fatal, including: Bacteremia or sepsis when bacteria spread to the bloodstream usually as a result of using catheters or having surgery. Pneumonia which predominantly affects people with underlying lung disease including those on mechanical ventilators. Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) which can lead to heart failure. Osteomyelitis (bone infection) which can be caused by staph bacteria traveling in the bloodstream or put there by direct contact such as following trauma (puncture wound of foot or intravenous (IV) drug abuse). Top of page How do VISA and VRSA get their names? Staph bacteria are classified as VISA or VRSA based on laboratory tests. Laboratories perform tests to determine if staph bacteria are resistant to antimicrobial agents that might be used for treatment of infections. For vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents, laboratories determine how much of the agent it requires to inhibit the growth of the organism in a test tube. The result of the test is usually expressed as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or the minimum amount of antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial growth in the test tube. Therefore, staph bacteria are classified as VISA if the MIC for vancomycin is 4-8µg/ml, and classified as VRSA if the vancomycin MIC is ≥16µg/ml. Top of page What should a patient do if they suspect they have a staph, MRSA, VISA, or VRSA infection? See a healthcare provider. Top of page Are VISA and VRSA infections treatable? Yes. As of October 2010, all VISA and VRSA isolates have been susceptible to several Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Top of page How can the spread of VISA and VRSA be prevented? Use of appropriate infection control practices (such as wearing gloves before and after contact with infectious body substances and adherence to hand hygiene) by healthcare personnel can reduce the spread of VISA and VRSA. Top of page What should a person do if a family member or close friend has VISA or VRSA? VISA and VRSA are types of antibiotic-resistant staph bacteria. Therefore, as with all staph bacteria, spread occurs among people having close physical contact with infected patients or contaminated material, such as bandages. Persons having close physical contact with infected patients while they are outside of the healthcare setting should: (1) keep their hands clean by washing thoroughly with soap and water, and (2) avoid contact with other people's wounds or material contaminated from wounds. If they go to the hospital to visit a friend or family member who is infected with VISA or VRSA , they must follow the hospital's recommended precautions. Top of page What is CDC doing to address VISA and VRSA? In addition to providing guidance for clinicians and infection control personnel, CDC is also working with state and local health agencies, healthcare facilities, and clinical microbiology laboratories to ensure that laboratories are using proper methods to detect VISA and VRSA. Top of page Recommendations and Guidelines CDC issued a Clinical Reminder, in 2010, which serves as a reminder about the important role of clinical laboratories in the diagnosis of VRSA cases to ensure prompt recognition, isolation, and management by infection control personnel.

NHLBI_0000114_Sec4.txt,"Question: What are the symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/rls
Answer: The four key signs of restless legs syndrome (RLS) are:
                
A strong urge to move your legs. This urge often, but not always, occurs with unpleasant feelings in your legs. When the disorder is severe, you also may have the urge to move your arms.
                
Symptoms that start or get worse when you're inactive. The urge to move increases when you're sitting still or lying down and resting.
                
Relief from moving. Movement, especially walking, helps relieve the unpleasant feelings.
                
Symptoms that start or get worse in the evening or at night.
                
You must have all four of these signs to be diagnosed with RLS.
                
The Urge To Move
                
RLS gets its name from the urge to move the legs when sitting or lying down. This movement relieves the unpleasant feelings that RLS sometimes causes. Typical movements are:
                
Pacing and walking
                
Jiggling the legs
                
Stretching and flexing
                
Tossing and turning
                
Rubbing the legs
                
Unpleasant Feelings
                
People who have RLS describe the unpleasant feelings in their limbs as creeping, crawling, pulling, itching, tingling, burning, aching, or electric shocks. Severe RLS may cause painful feelings. However, the pain usually is more of an ache than a sharp, stabbing pain.
                
Children may describe RLS symptoms differently than adults. In children, the condition may occur with hyperactivity. However, it's not fully known how the disorders are related.
                
The unpleasant feelings from RLS often occur in the lower legs (calves). But the feelings can occur at any place in the legs or feet. They also can occur in the arms.
                
The feelings seem to come from deep within the limbs, rather than from the surface. You usually will have the feelings in both legs. However, the feelings can occur in one leg, move from one leg to the other, or affect one leg more than the other.
                
People who have mild symptoms may notice them only when they're still or awake for a long time, such as on a long airplane trip or while watching TV. If they fall asleep quickly, they may not have symptoms when lying down at night.
                
The unpleasant feelings from RLS aren't the same as the leg cramps many people get at night. Leg cramps often are limited to certain muscle groups in the leg, which you can feel tightening. Leg cramps cause more severe pain and require stretching the affected muscle for relief.
                
Sometimes arthritis or peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) can cause pain or discomfort in the legs. Moving the limbs usually worsens the discomfort instead of relieving it.
                
Periodic Limb Movement in Sleep
                
Many people who have RLS also have a condition called periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS). PLMS causes your legs or arms to twitch or jerk about every 10 to 60 seconds during sleep. These movements cause you to wake up often and get less sleep.
                
PLMS usually affects the legs, but it also can affect the arms. Not everyone who has PLMS also has RLS.
                
Related Sleep Problems
                
RLS can make it hard to fall or stay asleep. If RLS disturbs your sleep, you may feel very tired during the day.

ADAM_0000455_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Birth control pill overdose
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002599.htm
Answer: Summary : Birth control pills, also called oral contraceptives, are prescription medicines used to prevent pregnancy. Birth control pill overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose.  This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual overdose. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poisonous Ingredient : Most birth control pills contain one of the following combinations of estrogen and progestin hormones:  - Ethynodiol diacetate and ethinyl estradiol  - Ethynodiol diacetate and mestranol  - Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol  - Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol  - Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol  - Mestranol and norethindrone  - Mestranol and norethynodrel  - Norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol   These birth control pills contain progestin only:  - Norethindrone  - Norgestrel   Other birth control pills may also contain these ingredients.

Where Found : Here are several birth control medicines, with their brand names in parentheses:  - Ethinyl estradiol and ethynodiol diacetate (Demulen)  - Mestranol and ethynodiol diacetate (Ovulen)  - Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Nordette, Tri-Levlen, Triphasil)  - Norethindrone (Micronor, Nor-Q.D.)  - Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (Loestrin, Norlestrin)  - Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (Brevicon, Ortho-Novum 1/35, Modicon, Ortho-Novum 7/7/7, Ovcon)  - Mestranol and norethindrone (Ortho-Novum 1/50)  - Mestranol and norethynodrel (Enovid)  - Norgestrel (Ovrette)  - Norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Lo Ovral, Ovral)   Other birth control pills may also be available.

Symptoms : Symptoms of an overdose of birth control pills include:  - Breast tenderness  - Discolored urine  - Drowsiness  - Heavy vaginal bleeding (2 to 7 days after the overdose)  - Headache  - Emotional changes  - Nausea and vomiting  - Rash

Home Care : Seek medical help right away, and call poison control. Do NOT make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to.  Stop using the birth control pills and use other methods to prevent pregnancy, if desired. The overdose is NOT likely to be life-threatening.

Before Calling Emergency : Have this information ready:  - Person's age, weight, and condition  - The name of the medicine (ingredients and strength, if known)  - When it was swallowed  - The amount swallowed  - If the medicine was prescribed for the person

Poison Control : Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room : A trip to the emergency room (ER) will probably not be necessary. If you do go, take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.  If an ER visit is needed, the provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The person may receive:  - Activated charcoal (in extreme cases)  - Blood and urine tests  - Medicines to treat symptoms

Outlook (Prognosis) : Serious symptoms are very unlikely.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000655.htm
Answer: Birth control pills help keep you from getting pregnant. When taken daily, they are one of the most effective methods of contraception. For most women they are extremely safe. They also have a number of other benefits, including helping to:  - Improve painful, heavy, or irregular periods   - Treat acne  - Prevent ovarian cancer   Combination birth control pills contain both estrogen and progestin. Some combination birth control pills allow you to have fewer periods each year. These are called continuous or extended-cycle pills. Ask your health care provider about dosing options to decrease the frequency of your menstrual cycles.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000655.htm
Answer: Birth control pills come in packages. You take pills from a 21-pack once a day for 3 weeks, then you do not take pills for 1 week. It may be easier to remember to take 1 pill every day, so other pills come in a 28-pack of pills, with some having active pills (containing hormones) and some with no hormones.  There are 5 types of combination birth control pills. Your provider will help you choose the right one for you. The 5 types are:  - One phase pills: These have the same amount of estrogen and progestin in all the active pills.  - Two phase pills: The level of hormones in these pills changes once during each menstrual cycle.  - Three phase pills: Every 7 days the dose of hormones changes.  - Four phase pills: The dose of hormones in these pills changes 4 times each cycle.  - Continuous or extended cycle pills: These keep the level of hormones up so you have few or no periods.)

ADAM_0000457_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Birth control pills - overview (Also called: Contraception - pills - hormonal methods; Hormonal birth control methods; Birth control pills; Contraceptive pills; BCP; OCP)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007460.htm
Answer: Summary : Birth control pills (BCPs) contain man-made forms of two hormones called estrogen and progestin. These hormones are made naturally in a woman's ovaries. Birth control pills can contain both of these hormones, or have progestin only.  Both hormones prevent a woman's ovary from releasing an egg during her menstrual cycle (called ovulation). They do this by changing the levels of the natural hormones the body makes.  Progestins also make the mucus around a woman's cervix thick and sticky. This helps prevent sperm from entering the uterus.

Information : Birth control pills are also called oral contraceptives or just ""the pill."" A health care provider must prescribe birth control pills.  - The most common type of birth control pill combines the hormones estrogen and progestin. There are many different forms of this type of pill.  - The ""mini-pill"" is a type of birth control pill that contains only progestin, no estrogen. These pills are an option for women who do not like the side effects of estrogen or who cannot take estrogen for medical reasons.  - They can also be used after delivery in women who are breast-feeding.    All women who take birth control pills need a check-up at least once a year. Women should also have their blood pressure checked 3 months after they begin to take the pill.  Birth control pills only work well if the woman remembers to take her pill daily without missing a day. Only 2 or 3 women out of 100 who take birth control pills correctly for a year will get pregnant.  Birth control pills may cause many side effects. These include:  - Changes in menstrual cycles, no menstrual cycles, extra bleeding  - Nausea, mood changes, worsening of migraines (mostly due to estrogens)  - Breast tenderness and weight gain   Rare but dangerous risks from taking birth control pills include:   - Blood clots  - Heart attack  - High blood pressure  - Stroke   Birth control pills without estrogen are much less likely to cause these problems. The risk is higher for women who smoke or have a history of high blood pressure, clotting disorders, or unhealthy cholesterol levels. However, the risk of these complications are much lower with either type of pill than with pregnancy.   Regular menstrual cycles will return within 3 to 6 months after a woman stops using most hormonal birth control methods.)

ADAM_0000458_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Birth control pills - progestin only (Also called: Mini-pill; the pill - progestin; Oral contraceptives - progestin; OCP - progestin; Contraception - progestin)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000656.htm
Answer: Summary : Birth control pills help keep you from getting pregnant. The pills with only progestin come in 28-day packs. Every pill is active. Each has only progestin, and no estrogen. These types of birth control pills are used for women who have medical reasons that prevent them from taking a combination oral contraceptive pill (pills that contain progestin and estrogen). Women who take progestin-only pills may:  - Have migraine headaches  - Be breastfeeding  - Have a history of blood clots    Progestin-only pills are very effective if taken correctly.  Progestin-only pills work by making your mucus too think for sperm to move through.

How Do I Start Taking Progestin Pills? : You may start taking these pills any time in your menstrual cycle.  Protection from pregnancy begins after 2 days. If you have sex within the first 48 hours after your first pill, use another birth control method (condom, diaphragm, or sponge). This is called backup birth control.

How Do I Take Them? : You must take the progestin-only pill at the same time every day.  Never miss a day of taking your pills.  When you have 2 packs of pills left, call your health care provider for an appointment to get a refill. The day after you finish a pack of pills you need to start a new pack.  With these pills you may:   - Get no periods  - Bleed a bit on and off through the month  - Get your period in the fourth week

What if I Do not Take My Pill on Time? : If you do not take the progestin pill on time, your mucus will start to thin and you could become pregnant.  When you realize you missed your pill, take it as soon as possible. If it is 3 hours or more since it was due, use a backup birth control method for the next 48 hours after taking the last pill. Then take your next pill at the usual time. If you had sex in the last 3 to 5 days, consider asking your provider for emergency contraception. If you have any questions or concerns, call your provider.  If you vomit after you take a pill, take another pill as soon as possible, and use a backup birth control method for the next 48 hours.

What to Expect When I Stop : You may decide to stop taking birth control pills because you want to get pregnant or you want to change to another birth control method. Here are some things to expect when you stop taking the pill:  - You should get your period 4 to 6 weeks after you take your last pill. If you do not get your period in 8 weeks, call your provider.  - Your period may be heavier or lighter than usual.  - You may have mild spotting of blood before you get your first period.  - You might become pregnant right away.

When to Use a Backup Method : Use a backup method of birth control, such as a condom, diaphragm, or sponge, if:  - You take a pill 3 hours or more after it was due.  - You miss 1 or more pills.  - You are sick, throwing up, or have loose stools (diarrhea). Even if you take your pill, your body may not absorb it. Use a backup method of birth control, and call your provider.  - You are taking another medicine that may prevent the pill from working. Tell your provider or pharmacist if you take any other medicines, such as antibiotics, seizure medicine, medicine to treat HIV, or St. John's wort. Find out if what you take will interfere with how well the pill works.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Call your health care provider if:  - You have swelling in your leg  - You have leg pain  - Your leg feels warm to the touch or has changes in skin color  - You have fever or chills  - You are short of breath and it is hard to breathe  - You have chest pain  - You cough up blood

ADAM_0002237_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Iron deficiency anemia ? (Also called: Anemia - iron deficiency)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000584.htm
Answer: Iron deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia.  Red blood cells bring oxygen to the body's tissues. Healthy red blood cells are made in your bone marrow. Red blood cells circulate through your body for 3 to 4 months. Parts of your body, such as your spleen, remove old blood cells.  Iron is a key part of red blood cells. Without iron, the blood cannot carry oxygen effectively. Your body normally gets iron through your diet. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells.  Iron deficiency anemia develops when your body's iron stores run low. This can occur because:  - You lose more blood cells and iron than your body can replace  - Your body does not do a good job of absorbing iron  - Your body is able to absorb iron, but you are not eating enough foods that contain iron  - Your body needs more iron than normal (such as if you are pregnant or breastfeeding)    Bleeding can cause iron loss. Common causes of bleeding are:  - Heavy, long, or frequent menstrual periods  - Cancer in the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, or colon  - Esophageal varices, usually from cirrhosis  - The use of aspirin, ibuprofen, or arthritis medicines for a long time, which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding  - Peptic ulcer disease   The body may not absorb enough iron in your diet due to:  - Celiac disease  - Crohn disease  - Gastric bypass surgery  - Taking too many antacids that contain calcium    You may not get enough iron in your diet if:  - You are a strict vegetarian  - You are an older adult and do not eat a full diet)

ADAM_0004363_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about 25-hydroxy vitamin D test (Also called: 25-OH vitamin D test; Calcidiol; 25-hydroxycholecalciferol test)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003569.htm
Answer: Summary : The 25-hydroxy vitamin D test is the most accurate way to measure how much vitamin D is in your body.  In the kidney, 25-hydroxy vitamin D changes into an active form of the vitamin. The active form of vitamin D helps control calcium and phosphate levels in the body.  This article discusses the blood test used to measure the amount of 25-hydroxy vitamin D.

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.

How to Prepare for the Test : Usually you will not need to fast. However, this depends on the laboratory and the testing method used.

How the Test Will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.

Why the Test is Performed : This test is done to determine if you have too much or too little vitamin D in your blood.

Normal Results : The normal range of vitamin D is measured as nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Many experts recommend a level between 20 and 40 ng/mL. Others recommend a level between 30 and 50 ng/mL.  The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some laboratories use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results, and whether you may need vitamin D supplements.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Lower-than-normal levels can be due to a vitamin D deficiency, which can result from:  - Lack of exposure to sunlight  - Lack of enough vitamin D in the diet  - Liver and kidney diseases  - Poor food absorption  - Use of certain medicines, including phenytoin, phenobarbital, and rifampin    Low vitamin D levels are more common in African-American children (especially in the winter), as well as in infants who are breastfed only. Low vitamin D levels have also been associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. For more information, see the article on vitamin D deficiency.  Higher-than-normal levelsmay be due to excess vitamin D, a condition called hypervitaminosis D.

Risks : Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.  Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling light-headed  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken))

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 25. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Epileptic encephalopathy - Muscular hypotonia of the trunk - Status epilepticus - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.

Answer: Summary : Iron is a mineral that our bodies need for many functions. For example, iron is part of hemoglobin, a protein which carries oxygen from our lungs throughout our bodies. It helps our muscles store and use oxygen. Iron is also part of many other proteins and enzymes.    Your body needs the right amount of iron. If you have too little iron, you may develop iron deficiency anemia. Causes of low iron levels include blood loss, poor diet, or an inability to absorb enough iron from foods. People at higher risk of having too little iron are young children and women who are pregnant or have periods.    Too much iron can damage your body. Taking too many iron supplements can cause iron poisoning. Some people have an inherited disease called hemochromatosis. It causes too much iron to build up in the body.

ADAM_0002137_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Ileostomy and your child (Also called: Standard ileostomy and your child; Brooke ileostomy and your child; Continent ileostomy and your child; Abdominal pouch and your child; End ileostomy and your child; Ostomy and your child)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000069.htm
Answer: Summary : Your child had an injury or disease in their digestive system and needed an operation called an ileostomy. The operation changed the way your child's body gets rid of waste (stool, feces, or poop).  Now your child has an opening called a stoma in their belly. Waste will pass through the stoma into a pouch that collects it. You and your child will need to take care of the stoma and empty the pouch many times a day.

Introduction : Seeing your child's ileostomy for the first time may be hard. Many parents feel guilty or that it is their fault when their children get ill and need this operation.  Parents also worry about how their child will be accepted now and later in life.  This is a difficult transition. But, if you are relaxed and positive about your child's ileostomy from the beginning, your child will have a much easier time with it. Talking with friends, family members, or a mental health counselor may help you.

Caring for Your Child's Ileostomy : Your child will need help and support. Begin by having them help you empty and change their pouch. After time, older children will be able to gather supplies and change and empty their own pouch. Even a young child can learn to empty the pouch by themselves.  Be prepared for some trial and error in taking care of your child's ileostomy.

Possible Complications : It is normal to have some problems with your child's ileostomy. Some common ones are:  - Your child may have trouble with some foods. Some foods lead to loose stools (diarrhea) and some can increase gas production. Talk to your health care provider about food choices that will help avoid these problems.  - Your child may have skin problems near the ileostomy.  - Your child's pouch may leak or get messy.   Help your child understand how important it is take good care of their ileostomy and to clean up the bathroom after ileostomy care.

Living with an Ileostomy : Children do not like to be different from their friends and classmates. Your child may have many difficult emotions, including frustration and embarrassment.  You may see some changes in your child's behavior at first. Sometimes teenagers have a harder time accepting their ileostomy than younger children. Try to keep a positive attitude and use humor when it fits the situation. You being open and natural will help your child's behavior stay positive.  Help your child learn how to handle problems with their ileostomy on their own.  Help your child decide who they want to talk to about their ileostomy. Talk with your child about what they will say. Be firm, calm, and open. It can help to do a role play, where you pretend you are one of the people your child has decided to tell about their ileostomy. Ask questions that person might ask. This will help your child prepare to talk with other people.  Your child should feel that you understand what it is like to have an ileostomy. Help them learn to take care of themselves, and let them know they will be able to live a full life.  When problems do happen, stay calm and ask for help from your child's provider.

Returning to School and Activities : Be flexible with your child as they adjust to school and everyday situations.  When your child returns to school, have a plan to deal with problems or emergencies. If your child knows what to do when there is leakage, it will help them avoid embarrassing situations.  Your child should be able to take part in recess and sports, go camping and have other overnight trips, and do all other school and after-school activities.

Answer: Rickets is a disorder caused by a lack of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. It leads to softening and weakening of the bones.)

ADAM_0003420_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Rickets ? (Also called: Osteomalacia in children; Vitamin D deficiency; Renal rickets; Hepatic rickets)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000344.htm
Answer: Vitamin D helps the body control calcium and phosphate levels. If the blood levels of these minerals become too low, the body may produce hormones that cause calcium and phosphate to be released from the bones. This leads to weak and soft bones.  Vitamin D is absorbed from food or produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight. Lack of vitamin D production by the skin may occur in people who:  - Live in climates with little exposure to sunlight  - Must stay indoors  - Work indoors during the daylight hours   You may not get enough vitamin D from your diet if you:  - Are lactose intolerant (have trouble digesting milk products)  - Do not drink milk products  - Follow a vegetarian diet   Infants who are breastfed only may develop vitamin D deficiency. Human breast milk does not supply the proper amount of vitamin D. This can be a particular problem for darker-skinned children in winter months (when there are lower levels of sunlight).  Not getting enough calcium and phosphorous in your diet can also lead to rickets. Rickets caused by a lack of these minerals in diet is rare in developed countries, because calcium and phosphorous are found in milk and green vegetables.  Your genes may increase your risk of rickets. Hereditary rickets is a form of the disease that is passed down through families. It occurs when the kidneys are unable to hold onto the mineral phosphate. Rickets may also be caused by kidney disorders that involve renal tubular acidosis.  Disorders that reduce the digestion or absorption of fats will make it more difficult for vitamin D to be absorbed into the body.  Occasionally, rickets may occur in children who have disorders of the liver, or who cannot convert vitamin D to its active form.  Rickets is rare in the United States. It is most likely to occur in children during periods of rapid growth, when the body needs high levels of calcium and phosphate. Rickets may be seen in children ages 6to 24 months. It is uncommon in newborns.)

Answer: You can prevent rickets by making sure that your child gets enough calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D in the diet. People who have gastrointestinal or other disorders may need to take supplements. Ask your child's health care provider.  Kidney (renal) causes of poor vitamin D absorption should be treated right away. People who have renal disorders should have their calcium and phosphorus levels monitored regularly.  Genetic counseling may help people who have a family history of inherited disorders that can cause rickets.)

ADAM_0003489_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Scoliosis surgery - child (Also called: Spinal curvature surgery - child; Kyphoscoliosis surgery - child; Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery - child; VATS - child)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007383.htm
Answer: Summary : Scoliosis surgery repairs abnormal curving of the spine (scoliosis). The goal is to safely straighten your child's spine and align your child's shoulders and hips to correct your child's back problem.

Description : Before surgery, your child will receive general anesthesia. This will make your child unconscious and unable to feel pain during the operation.  During surgery, your child's surgeon will use steel rods, hooks, screws, or other metal devices to straighten your child's spine and support the bones of the spine. Bone grafts are placed to hold the spine in the correct position and keep it from curving again.  The surgeon will make at least one surgical cut to get to your child's spine. This cut may be in your child's back, chest, or both places. The surgeon may also do the procedure using a special video camera.   - A surgical cut in the back is called the posterior approach. This surgery usually takes several hours.   - A cut through the chest wall is called a thoracotomy. The surgeon makes a cut in your child's chest, deflates a lung, and usually removes a rib. Recovery after this surgery is often faster.  - Some surgeons do both of these approaches together. This is a much longer and more difficult operation.  - Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a another technique. It is used for certain kinds of spinal curves. It takes a lot of skill, and not all surgeons are trained to do it. The child must wear a brace for around 3 months after this procedure.    During the surgery:  - The surgeon will move muscles aside after making the cut.  - The joints between the different vertebrae (the bones of the spine) will be taken out.  - Bone grafts will often be put in to replace them.  - Metal instruments, such as rods, screws, hooks, or wires will also be placed to help hold the spine together until the bone grafts attach and heal.    The surgeon may get bone for the grafts in these ways:  - The surgeon may take bone from another part of your child's body. This is called an autograft. Bone taken from a person's own body is often the best.  - Bone can also be taken from a bone bank, much like a blood bank. This is called an allograft. These grafts are not always as successful as autografts.  - Manmade (synthetic) bone substitute may also be used.    Different surgeries use different types of metal instruments. These are usually left in the body after the bone fuses together.   During surgery, the surgeon will use special equipment to keep an eye on the nerves that come from the spine to make sure they are not damaged.  Scoliosis surgery usually takes 4 to 6 hours.

Why the Procedure is Performed : Braces are often tried first to keep the curve from getting worse. But when they no longer work, the child's health care provider will recommend surgery.  There are several reasons to treat scoliosis:  - Appearance is a major concern.  - Scoliosis often causes back pain.  - If the curve is severe enough, scoliosis affects your child's breathing.    The choice of when to have surgery will vary.  - After the bones of the skeleton stop growing, the curve should not get much worse. Because of this, the surgeon may wait until your child's bones stop growing.  - Your child may need surgery before this if the curve in the spine is severe or is getting worse quickly.    Surgery is usually recommended for the following children and adolescents with scoliosis of unknown cause (idiopathic scoliosis):  - All young people whose skeletons have matured, and who have a curve greater than 45 degrees.  - Growing children whose curve has gone beyond 40 degrees. (Not all doctors agree on whether all children with curves of 40 degrees should have surgery.)

Risks : There may be complications with any of the procedures for scoliosis repair.  Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:  - Reactions to medicines or breathing problems  - Bleeding, blood clots, or infection    Risks of scoliosis surgery are:  - Blood loss that requires a transfusion.  - Gallstones or pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)  - Intestinal obstruction (blockage).  - Nerve injury causing muscle weakness or paralysis (very rare)  - Lung problems up to 1 week after surgery. Breathing may not return to normal until 1 to 2 months after surgery.    Problems that may develop in the future include:  - Fusion does not heal. This can lead to a painful condition in which a false joint grows at the site. This is called pseudarthrosis.  - The parts of the spine that are fused can no longer move. This puts stress on other parts of the back. The extra stress can cause back pain and make the disks break down (disk degeneration).  - A metal hook placed in the spine may move a little. Or a metal rod may rub on a sensitive spot. Both of these can cause some pain.  - New spine problems may develop, especially in children who have surgery before their spine has stopped growing.

Before the Procedure : Tell your child's doctor or nurse what medicines your child is taking. This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.  Before the operation:  - Your child will have a complete physical exam by the doctor.  - Your child will learn about the surgery and what to expect.  - Your child will learn how to do special breathing exercises to help the lungs recover after surgery.  - Your child will be taught special ways to do everyday things after surgery to protect the spine. This includes learning how to move properly, changing from one position to another, and sitting, standing, and walking. Your child will be told to use a ""log-rolling"" technique when getting out of bed. This means moving the entire body at once to avoid twisting the spine.  - Your child's doctor or nurse will talk with you about having your child store some of his or her blood about a month before the surgery. This is so that your child's own blood can be used if a transfusion is needed during surgery.    During the 2 weeks before the surgery:  - If your child smokes, he or she needs to stop. People who have spine fusion and keep smoking do not heal as well. Ask the doctor for help.  - Two weeks before surgery, the doctor may ask you to stop giving your child medicines that make it harder for the blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn).  - Ask your child's doctor which medicines you should still give your child on the day of the surgery.  - Let the doctor know right away when your child has any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness before the surgery.    On the day of the surgery:  - You will likely be asked not to give your child anything to eat or drink 6 to 12 hours before the procedure.  - Give your child any medicines the doctor told you to give with a small sip of water.    The doctor or nurse will tell you when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time.

After the Procedure : Your child will need to stay in the hospital for about 3 to 4 days after surgery. The repaired spine should be kept in its proper position to keep it aligned. If the surgery involved a surgical cut in the chest, your child may have a tube in the chest to drain fluid buildup. This tube is often removed after 24 to 72 hours.  A catheter (tube) may be placed in the bladder the first few days to help your child urinate.  Your child's stomach and bowels may not work for a few days after surgery. Your child may need to receive fluids and nutrition through an intravenous (IV) line.  Your child will receive pain medicine in the hospital. At first, the medicine may be delivered through a special catheter inserted into your child's back. After that, a pump may be used to control how much pain medicine your child gets. Your child may also get shots or take pain pills.  Your child may have a body cast or a body brace.  Follow any instructions you are given on how to care for your child at home.

Outlook (Prognosis) : Your child's spine should look much straighter after surgery. There will still be some curve. It takes at least 3 months for the spinal bones to fuse together well. It will take 1 to 2 years for them to fuse completely.  Fusion stops growth in the spine. This is not usually a concern because most growth occurs in the long bones of the body, such as the leg bones. Children who have this surgery will probably gain height from both growth in the legs and from having a straighter spine.)

ADAM_0003685_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Spleen removal - child - discharge (Also called: Splenectomy - child - discharge; Spleen removal - child - discharge)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000277.htm
Answer: Summary : Your child's spleen was removed after your child was given general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free).  - If your child had open surgery, the surgeon made an incision (cut) in your child's belly.  - If your child had laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon made 3 to 4 small cuts in your child's belly.

What to Expect at Home : Most children recover quickly after spleen removal. Recovery from laparoscopic surgery is usually faster than recovery from open surgery.  Your child may have some of these symptoms. All of them should slowly go away:  - Pain around the incisions for a few days.  - Sore throat from the breathing tube. Sucking on ice chips or gargling (if your child is old enough to do these things) can help soothe the throat.  - Bruising, skin redness, or pain around the cut, or cuts.  - Problems taking deep breaths.    If your child's spleen was removed for a blood disorder or lymphoma, your child may need more treatment depending on the disorder.

Activity : When you lift your baby, support both the baby's head and bottom for the first 4 to 6 weeks after surgery.  Toddlers and older children will often stop any activity if they get tired. DO NOT press them to do more if they seem tired.  Your health care provider will tell you when it is ok for your child to return to school or daycare. This may be as soon as 2 to 3 weeks after surgery.  Your child's activity restrictions will depend on:   - The type of surgery (open or laparoscopic)  - Your child's age  - The reason for the operation    Ask your doctor about specific activity instructions and limitations.  In general, walking and climbing stairs is ok. Swimming is ok after the strips of tape have fallen off your child's incisions, and the doctor says it is ok.  You can give your child acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain. The doctor may also prescribe other pain medicines to use at home if your child needs them.

Wound Care : Your doctor will tell you when to remove your child's dressings. Care for the incisions as instructed. Keep the incision area clean and dry. Only wash it if instructed by your doctor.  You may remove the incision dressings (bandages) to give your child a shower. If strips of tape or surgical glue were used to close the incision:  - Cover the incision with plastic wrap before showering for the first week.  - DO NOT try to wash off the tape or glue. They will fall off in about a week.    Your child should not soak in a bathtub or hot tub or go swimming until your doctor says it is ok.

Preventing Infections : Most people live a normal active life without a spleen, but there is always a risk of getting an infection. This is because the spleen is part of the body's immune system, helping fight certain infections.  Your child will be more likely to get infections without a spleen:  - Risk of infection is highest in the first 2 years after surgery, or until your child is 5 or 6 years old.  - Always tell your child's doctor if your child has a fever, sore throat, headache, belly pain, or diarrhea, or an injury that breaks the skin. Most of the time, problems like these will not be serious. But, sometimes they can lead to major infections.    For the first week after surgery, check your child's temperature every day.  Ask your child's doctor if your child should have (or already had) these vaccines:  - Pneumonia  - Meningococcal  - Haemophilus  - Flu shot (every year)    Your child may need to take antibiotics every day for a while. Tell your child's doctor if the medicine is causing your child any problems. DO NOT stop giving antibiotics before checking with your child's doctor.  These things will help prevent infections in your child:  - Teach your child to wash his or her hands often with soap and water. Family members should do the same.  - Get your child treated for any bites, especially dog bites, right away.  - Let your child's doctor know if your child will be traveling out of the country. Your child may need to carry extra antibiotics, take precautions against malaria, and make sure immunizations are up to date.  - Tell all of your child's health care providers (dentist, doctors, nurses, or nurse practitioners) that your child does not have a spleen.  - Ask your child's provider about a special bracelet for your child to wear that says your child does not have a spleen.

Other Care : After surgery, most babies and infants (younger than 12 to 15 months) can take as much formula or breast milk as they want. Ask your child's doctor first if this is right for your baby. Your child's provider may tell you how to add extra calories to formula.  Give toddlers and older children regular, healthy foods. The provider will tell you about any changes you should make.

When to Call the Doctor : Call your health care provider if:  - Your child's temperature is above 101F (38.3C).  - The surgical wounds are bleeding, are red or warm to the touch, or have a thick, yellow, green, or milky drainage.  - Your child has pain that is not helped by pain medicines.  - It is hard for your child to breathe.  - Your child has a cough that does not go away.  - Your child cannot drink or eat.  - Your child is not as energetic as usual, is not eating, and looks ill.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000579.htm
Answer: Summary : Your child is scheduled to have surgery. Learn about what to expect on the day of surgery so that you will be prepared. If your child is old enough to understand, you can help them prepare as well.  The doctor's office will let you know what time you should arrive on the day of surgery. This may be early in the morning.  - If your child is having minor surgery, your child will go home afterward on the same day.  - If your child is having major surgery, your child will stay in the hospital after the surgery.

What to Expect Before Surgery : The anesthesia and surgery team will talk with you and your child before surgery. You may meet with them at an appointment before the day of surgery or on the same day of surgery. To make sure your child is healthy and ready for surgery, they will:  - Check your child's height, weight, and vital signs  - Ask about your child's health. If your child is sick, the doctors may wait until your child is better to do the surgery.  - Find out about any medicines your child takes. Tell them about any prescription, over the counter (OTC), and herbal medicines.  - Do a physical exam on your child    To get your child ready for surgery, the surgical team will:  - Confirm the location and type of your child's surgery. The doctor may mark the site with a special marker.  - Talk to you about the anesthesia they will give your child  - Get any needed lab tests for your child. Your child may have blood drawn or may be asked to give a urine sample.  - Answer any of your questions. Bring paper and pen to write down notes. Ask about your child's surgery, recovery, and pain management.    You will sign admission papers and consent forms for your child's surgery and anesthesia. Bring these items with you:  - Insurance card  - Identification card  - Any medicine in the original bottles  - X-rays and test results

What to Expect on the Day of Surgery : Be prepared for the day.  - Help your child feel safe and secure. Bring a favorite toy, stuffed animal, or blanket. Label items from home with your child's name. Leave valuables at home.  - The day of surgery will be busy for your child and you. Expect that your child's surgery and recovery will take all day.  - DO NOT make other plans for the day of surgery.  - Arrange child care for your other children on that day.    Arrive on time to the surgery unit.  Get your child ready for surgery.  - Your child may get some liquid medicine that helps your child relax and feel sleepy.  - You will wait with your child in a waiting room until the surgeon is ready for your child.  - The doctors and nurses want to make sure that your child is safe at all times. They will do safety checks. Expect them to ask you: your child's name, birthday, the surgery your child is having, and the body part that is being operated on.    DO NOT bring food or drink into the pre-op area. Children having surgery are not eating or drinking. It is better for them not to see food or drinks.

What to Expect Going into Surgery : Give your child a hug and kiss. Remind your child that you will be there as soon as you can when they wake up.  If you are staying with your child during the start of anesthesia, you will:  - Put on special operating room clothing.  - Go with the nurse and your child into the operating room.  - Go to the waiting area after your child is asleep.

What to Expect During Surgery : In the operating room (OR), your child will breathe in sleeping medicine (anesthesia).  Usually, after your child is asleep, the doctor will put in an IV. Sometimes the IV has to be put in before your child is asleep.  You can wait in the waiting area. If you need to leave, give your cell phone number to the staff so they know how to reach you.

What to Expect After Surgery in the Recovery Room : Waking up from anesthesia:  - After surgery, your child goes to the recovery room. There, the doctors and nurses will watch your child closely. As the anesthesia wears off, your child will wake up.  - You may be allowed to go into the recovery room when your child starts to wake up. If this is allowed, the nurse will come get you.  - Know that children waking up from anesthesia can cry a lot and be confused. This is very common.  - If you would like to hold your child, ask the nurses to help you do this. You will need help with any equipment and how to hold your child comfortably.   Moving out of the recovery room:  - If your child is going home the same day, you will help them get dressed. Once your child can drink liquids, you can probably go home. Expect your child to be tired. Your child may sleep a lot throughout the rest of the day.  - If your child is staying in the hospital, your child will be moved to a hospital room. The nurse there will check your child's vital signs and pain level. If your child is having pain, the nurse will give your child pain medicine and any other medicine your child needs. The nurse will also encourage your child to drink if your child is allowed to have liquids.

ADAM_0004346_Sec2.txt,"Question: What is (are) Your child and the flu ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007445.htm
Answer: WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS I SHOULD WATCH FOR IN MY CHILD?  The flu is an infection of the nose, throat, and (sometimes) lungs. Your young child with the flu will most often have a fever of 100F (37.8C) or higher and a sore throat or a cough. Other symptoms you may notice:  - Chills, sore muscles, and headache  - Runny nose  - Acting tired and cranky much of the time  - Diarrhea and vomiting    When your child's fever goes down, many of these symptoms should get better.  HOW SHOULD I TREAT MY CHILD'S FEVER?  Do NOT bundle up a child with blankets or extra clothes, even if your child has the chills. This may keep their fever from coming down, or make it higher.  - Try one layer of lightweight clothing, and one lightweight blanket for sleep.  - The room should be comfortable, not too hot or too cool. If the room is hot or stuffy, a fan may help.    Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever in children. Sometimes, your provider will tell you to use both types of medicine.  - Know how much your child weighs, and then always check the instructions on the package.  - Give acetaminophen every 4to 6 hours.  - Give ibuprofen every 6to 8 hours. Do NOT use ibuprofen in children younger than 6 months old.  - Never give aspirin to children unless your child's provider tells you to use it.    A fever does not need to come all the way down to normal. Most children will feel better when the temperature drops by even 1 degree.   - A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool a fever. It works better if the child also is given medicine -- otherwise the temperature might bounce right back up.  - Do NOT use cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs. These often cause shivering and make things worse.    WHAT ABOUT FEEDING MY CHILD WHEN HE OR SHE IS SICK?  Your child can eat foods while having a fever, but do not force the child to eat. Encourage your child to drink fluids to prevent dehydration.  Children with the flu often do better with bland foods. A bland diet is made up of foods that are soft, not very spicy, and low in fiber. You may try:  - Breads, crackers, and pasta made with refined white flour  - Refined hot cereals, such as oatmeal and Cream of Wheat  - Fruit juices that are diluted by mixing half water and half juice. Do not give your child too much fruit or apple juice.  - Frozen fruit popsor gelatin (Jell-O) are good choices, especially if the child is vomiting.    WILL MY CHILD NEED ANTIVIRALS OR OTHER MEDICINES?  Children aged 2 to 4 years without high-risk conditions and with mild illness may not need antiviral treatment. Children 5 years and older will often not be given antivirals unless they have another high-risk condition.  When needed, these medicines work best if started within 48 hours after symptoms begin, if possible.   Either oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) are used.  - Oseltamivir comes as a capsule or in a liquid.  - Zanamivir is taken by inhaler.    Serious side effects from these medicines are quite rare. Health care providers and parents must balance the risk for rare side effects against the risk that their children can become quite sick and even die from the flu.  Talk to your provider before giving any over-the-counter cold medicines to your child.  WHEN SHOULD MY CHILD SEE A DOCTOR OR VISIT AN EMERGENCY ROOM?  Talk to your child's provider or go to the emergency room if:  - Your child does not act alert or more comfortable when their fever goes down.  - Fever and flu symptoms come back after they had gone away.  - There are no tears when they're crying.    SHOULD MY CHILD GET VACCINATED AGAINST THE FLU?  Even if your child has had a flu-like illness, they should still get the flu vaccine. All children 6 months or older should receive the vaccine. Children under 9 years will need a second flu vaccine around 4 weeks after receiving the vaccine for the first time.  There are two types of flu vaccine. One is given as a shot, and the other is sprayed into your child's nose.  - The flu shot contains killed (inactive) viruses. It is not possible to get the flu from this type of vaccine. The flu shot is approved for people age 6 months and older.  - A nasal spray-type swine flu vaccine uses a live, weakened virus instead of a dead one like the flu shot. It is approved for healthy children over 2 years. It should not be used in children who have repeated wheezing episodes, asthma, or other chronic respiratory diseases.    WHAT ARE THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE VACCINE?  It is not possible to get the flu from either the injection or shot flu vaccine. However, some people do get a low-grade fever for a day or two after the shot.  Most people have no side effects from the flu shot. Some people have soreness at the injection site or minor aches and low-grade fever for several days.  Normal side effects of the nasal flu vaccine include fever, headache, runny nose, vomiting, and some wheezing. Although these symptoms sound like symptoms of the flu, the side effects do not become a severe or life-threatening flu infection.  WILL THE VACCINE HARM MY CHILD?  A small amount of mercury (called thimerosal) is a common preservative in multidose vaccines. Despite concerns, thimerosal-containing vaccines have NOT been shown to cause autism, ADHD, or any other medical problems.  If you have concerns about mercury, all of the routine vaccines are also available without added thimerosal.  WHAT ELSE CAN I DO TO PROTECT MY CHILD FROM THE FLU?  Everyone who comes in close contact with your child should follow these tips:  - Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue away after using it.  - Wash hands often with soap and water for 15to 20 seconds, especially after you cough or sneeze. You may also use alcohol-based hand cleaners.  - Wear a face mask if you have had flu symptoms, or preferably, stay away from children.    If your child is less than 5 years old and has close contact with someone with flu symptoms, talk with your provider.)

GHR_0000184_Sec4.txt,"Question: Is Christianson syndrome inherited ? (Also called: Angelman-like syndrome, X-linked; intellectual deficit, X-linked, South African type)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/christianson-syndrome
Answer: This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.  In X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. She can pass on the altered gene but usually does not experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. Occasionally, however, females who carry an SLC9A6 gene mutation have mild learning disabilities. It is unclear if these disabilities are related to the gene mutation or occur by chance.)

Answer: HDL1, HDL2, and HDL4 are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.  As the mutation responsible for HDL2 or HDL4 is passed down from one generation to the next, the length of the repeated DNA segment may increase. A longer repeat segment is often associated with more severe signs and symptoms that appear earlier in life. This phenomenon is known as anticipation.  HDL3 is probably inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/2q37-deletion-syndrome
Answer: Most cases of 2q37 deletion syndrome are not inherited. They result from a chromosomal deletion that occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.  Rarely, affected individuals inherit a copy of chromosome 2 with a deleted segment from an unaffected parent. In these cases, one of the parents carries a chromosomal rearrangement between chromosome 2 and another chromosome. This rearrangement is called a balanced translocation. No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. However, translocations can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement with extra or missing genetic material. Some individuals with 2q37 deletion syndrome inherit an unbalanced translocation that deletes genetic material near the end of the long arm of chromosome 2, which results in birth defects and other health problems characteristic of this disorder.)

Answer: Summary : As children grow older, they develop in several different ways. Child development includes physical, intellectual, social, and emotional changes.    Children grow and mature at very different rates. It's hard to say what ""normal"" is. There can be big differences in height, weight, and build among healthy children. Diet, exercise and genes are all factors. Some children begin puberty or are close to it before they are teenagers.    Children start to become more independent from their parents. They may rebel. They also look outward - to their friends, who are usually of the same sex. Peer approval becomes very important. Your child may try new behaviors to be part of ""the group."" This can also be the time that parents or teachers recognize learning disabilities or behavioral problems in children. These problems can get worse as time goes on, so it is important to get help early.)

Answer: Rickets causes soft, weak bones in children. It usually occurs when they do not get enough vitamin D, which helps growing bones absorb the minerals calcium and phosphorous. It can also happen when calcium or phosphorus levels are too low.    Your child might not get enough vitamin D if he or she       - Has dark skin    - Spends too little time outside    - Has on sunscreen all the time when out of doors    - Doesn't eat foods containing vitamin D because of lactose intolerance or a strict vegetarian diet    - Is breastfed without receiving vitamin D supplements    - Can't make or use vitamin D because of a medical disorder such as celiac disease       In addition to dietary rickets, children can get an inherited form of the disease. Symptoms include bone pain or tenderness, impaired growth, and deformities of the bones and teeth. Your child's doctor uses lab and imaging tests to make the diagnosis. Treatment is replacing the calcium, phosphorus, or vitamin D that are lacking in the diet. Rickets is rare in the United States.)

GHR_0000464_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets ? (Also called: hypophosphatemia; VDRR; vitamin D-resistant rickets)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets
Answer: Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets is a disorder related to low levels of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphatemia). Phosphate is a mineral that is essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth.  In most cases, the signs and symptoms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets begin in early childhood. The features of the disorder vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Mildly affected individuals may have hypophosphatemia without other signs and symptoms. More severely affected children experience slow growth and are shorter than their peers. They develop bone abnormalities that can interfere with movement and cause bone pain. The most noticeable of these abnormalities are bowed legs or knock knees (a condition in which the lower legs are positioned at an outward angle). These abnormalities become apparent with weight-bearing activities such as walking. If untreated, they tend to worsen with time.  Other signs and symptoms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can include premature fusion of the skull bones (craniosynostosis) and dental abnormalities. The disorder may also cause abnormal bone growth where ligaments and tendons attach to joints (enthesopathy). In adults, hypophosphatemia is characterized by a softening of the bones known as osteomalacia.  Researchers have described several forms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, which are distinguished by their pattern of inheritance and genetic cause. The most common form of the disorder is known as X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH). It has an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance. X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive forms of the disorder are much rarer. The different inheritance patterns are described below.  Another rare type of the disorder is known as hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH). In addition to hypophosphatemia, this condition is characterized by the excretion of high levels of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria).)

GHR_0000464_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets ? (Also called: hypophosphatemia; VDRR; vitamin D-resistant rickets)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets
Answer: Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can result from mutations in several genes. Mutations in the PHEX gene, which are responsible for X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, occur most frequently. Mutations in other genes cause the less common forms of the condition.  Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets is characterized by a phosphate imbalance in the body. Among its many functions, phosphate plays a critical role in the formation and growth of bones in childhood and helps maintain bone strength in adults. Phosphate levels are controlled in large part by the kidneys. The kidneys normally excrete excess phosphate in urine, and they reabsorb this mineral into the bloodstream when more is needed. However, in people with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, the kidneys cannot reabsorb phosphate effectively and too much of this mineral is excreted from the body in urine. As a result, not enough phosphate is available in the bloodstream to participate in normal bone development and maintenance.  The genes associated with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets are involved in maintaining the proper balance of phosphate. Many of these genes, including the PHEX gene, directly or indirectly regulate a protein called fibroblast growth factor 23 (produced from the FGF23 gene). This protein normally inhibits the kidneys' ability to reabsorb phosphate into the bloodstream. Gene mutations increase the production or reduce the breakdown of fibroblast growth factor 23. The resulting overactivity of this protein reduces phosphate reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to hypophosphatemia and the related features of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets.)

Answer: Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have several patterns of inheritance. When the condition results from mutations in the PHEX gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.  Less commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females.  In a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The rare condition HHRH has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. However, some parents of children with HHRH have experienced hypercalcuria and kidney stones.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001956.htm
Answer: Summary : Your health care provider may give you a prescription in different ways, including:   - Writing a paper prescription that you take to a local pharmacy  - Calling or e-mailing a pharmacy to order the medicine  - Sending your prescription to the pharmacy by way of a computer that is linked to the provider's electronic medical record (EMR)    You also need to find out if your health plan will pay for the medicine your provider prescribed.   - Certain types or brands of medicine may not be covered.  - Many health plans require you to pay the pharmacy a portion of the cost of the prescription price. This called a co-pay.    Once you get a prescription from your provider, you may buy the medicine in different ways.   LOCAL PHARMACIES   The most common place for filling a prescription is at a local pharmacy. Some pharmacies are located inside of a grocery or large ""chain"" store.   It is best to fill all prescriptions with the same pharmacy. That way, the pharmacy has a record of all the medicines you are taking. This helps prevent drug interactions.   Your health plan may require you to use certain pharmacies. This means they may not pay for your prescription if you do not use one of these pharmacies. To find a pharmacy that takes your health plan:  - Call the phone number on the back of your insurance card.  - Call the pharmacy you want to use to see if they have a contract with your insurance plan.    To help the pharmacist fill the prescription:   - Make sure all of the information is filled in clearly.  - Bring your insurance card the first time you fill the prescription.  - When calling the pharmacy for a refill, make sure to give your name, the prescription number, and the name of the medicine.    MAIL-ORDER PHARMACIES   Some people and insurance companies choose to use mail-order pharmacies.   - The prescription is sent to the mail-order pharmacy or phoned in by the provider.  - Your medicine may cost less when you order it by mail. However, it may take a week or more for the medicine to get to you.  - Mail order is best used for long-term medicines you use for chronic problems.  - Buy short-term medicines and drugs that need to be stored at certain temperatures at a local pharmacy.    INTERNET (ONLINE) PHARMACIES   Internet pharmacies can be used for long-term medicines and medical supplies.   - The website should have clear directions for filling or transferring your prescription.  - Make sure that the website has clearly-stated privacy policies and other procedures.  - AVOID any website that claims a doctor can prescribe the medicine without seeing you.)

Street names include A- , zombie pills    When used to get high, they cause feelings of well-being, intense happiness, and excitement. As street drugs, depressants come in pills or capsules and are usually swallowed.  Harmful effects of depressants on the body include:  - Decreased attention span  - Impaired judgment  - Lack of coordination  - Lowered blood pressure  - Memory problems  - Slurred speech    Long-time users may have life-threatening withdrawal symptoms if they try to stop the drug abruptly.  OPIOIDS  Opioids are powerful painkillers. They are prescribed to treat pain after surgery or a dental procedure. Sometimes they are used to treat severe cough or diarrhea.  Types of opioids and their street names include:  -  Codeine: There are many medicinesthatcontaincodeine as an ingredient, especially ones for cough such as Robitussin A-C and Tylenol with codeine. Street names for codeine alone include captain cody, cody, little c, and school boy.For Tylenol with codeine, street names includeT1, T2, T3, T4, and dors and fours. Codeine syrup mixed with soda can have street namses such as purple drank, sizzup, or Texas tea.  -  Fentanyl: Drugs include Actiq, Duragesic, Onsolis, and Sublimaze.

Street names include cotton, hillbilly heroin, o.c., ox, oxy, oxycet, oxycotton, percs, pills.    When used to get high, opioids cause a person to feel relaxed and intensely happy. As street drugs, they come as powder, pills or capsules, syrup. They can be swallowed, injected, smoked, put into the rectum, or inhaled through the nose (snorted).  Harmful effects of opioids on the body include:  - Constipation  - Dry mouth  - Confusion  - Lack of coordination  - Lowered blood pressure  - Weakness, dizziness, sleepiness    In high doses, opioid intoxication can result, which can cause breathing problems, coma, or death.  STIMULANTS  These are drugs that stimulate the brain and body. They make the messages between the brain and body move faster. As a result, the person is more alert and physically active. Stimulants such as amphetaminesare prescribed to treat health problems such asobesity, narcolepsy, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  Types of stimulants and their street names include:  - Amphetamines, such as Adderall, Biphetamine, and Dexedrine. Street names include bennies, black beauties, crosses, hearts, LA turnaround, speed, truck drivers, uppers.  - Methylphenidate, such as Concerta, Metadate, Quillivant, and Ritalin. Street names include JIF, kibbles and bits, MPH, pineapple, r-ball, skippy, the smart drug, vitamin R.    When used to get high, stimulants cause a person to feel excited, very alert, and have increased energy. Some people use the drugs, especially amphetamines, to help them stay awake on the job or to study for a test. Others use them to boost their performance in sports.  As street drugs, they come as pills. They can be swallowed, injected, smoked, or inhaled through the nose (snorted).  Harmful effects of stimulants on the body include:  - Heart problems, such as fast heart rate, irregular heartbeat, increased blood pressure  - High body temperature and skin flushing  - Loss of appetite and weight loss  - Memory loss and problems thinking clearly  - Mood and emotional problems, such as aggressive or violent behavior  - Restlessness and tremors)

Answer: Treatment begins with recognizing there is aproblem. Once you decide you want to do something about your drug use, the next step is to get help and support.  Treatment programs use behavior modification techniques through counseling (talk therapy). The techniques get you to understand your behaviors and why you use drugs. Involving family and friends during counseling can help support you keep you from going back to using (relapsing).  With some drug addictions, such as opioids, medicines may also be used to help reduce the effects of opioids on the brain. Other medicines may be used to lessen cravings and withdrawal symptoms.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002142.htm
Answer: Question:   Is there a drug-free treatment for vaginal dryness?   Answer:   There are many causes of vaginal dryness. It may be caused by reduced estrogen levels, infection, medicines, and other things. Before treating yourself, talk to your health care provider.   Water-based lubricants and vaginal moisturizers work very well. Lubricants will moisten the vaginal opening and lining for several hours. The effects of a vaginal cream can last for up to a day.  Soybeans contain plant-based substances called isoflavones. These substances have an effect of the body that is similar to estrogen, but weaker. Therefore, it would seem that a diet rich in soy foods would improve symptoms of vaginal dryness. There continues to be research in this area, but the ideal sources or dose is still unknown. Soy foods include tofu, soy milk, and whole soybeans (also called edamame).  Many women claim that creams containing wild yam help with vaginal dryness. However, there is no good research that has evaluated these creams. Also, extracts of wild yam have not been found to have estrogen- or progesterone-like activities. Some of the products may have synthetic medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) added. MPA is a derivative of progesterone, and is also used in oral contraceptives. Like all supplements, MPA-containing products should be used with caution.  Black cohosh is an herb that some women use as a dietary supplement to relieve menopausal symptoms. However, it is not known if this herb helps with vaginal dryness.)

GHR_0000046_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) alternating hemiplegia of childhood ? (Also called: alternating hemiplegia syndrome)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/alternating-hemiplegia-of-childhood
Answer: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis, often affecting one side of the body (hemiplegia). During some episodes, the paralysis alternates from one side of the body to the other or affects both sides at the same time. These episodes begin in infancy or early childhood, usually before 18 months of age, and the paralysis lasts from minutes to days.  In addition to paralysis, affected individuals can have sudden attacks of uncontrollable muscle activity; these can cause involuntary limb movements (choreoathetosis), muscle tensing (dystonia), movement of the eyes (nystagmus), or shortness of breath (dyspnea). People with alternating hemiplegia of childhood may also experience sudden redness and warmth (flushing) or unusual paleness (pallor) of the skin. These attacks can occur during or separately from episodes of hemiplegia.  The episodes of hemiplegia or uncontrolled movements can be triggered by certain factors, such as stress, extreme tiredness, cold temperatures, or bathing, although the trigger is not always known. A characteristic feature of alternating hemiplegia of childhood is that all symptoms disappear while the affected person is sleeping but can reappear shortly after awakening. The number and length of the episodes initially worsen throughout childhood but then begin to decrease over time. The uncontrollable muscle movements may disappear entirely, but the episodes of hemiplegia occur throughout life.  Alternating hemiplegia of childhood also causes mild to severe cognitive problems. Almost all affected individuals have some level of developmental delay and intellectual disability. Their cognitive functioning typically declines over time.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/alternating-hemiplegia-of-childhood
Answer: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is primarily caused by mutations in the ATP1A3 gene. Very rarely, a mutation in the ATP1A2 gene is involved in the condition. These genes provide instructions for making very similar proteins. They function as different forms of one piece, the alpha subunit, of a larger protein complex called Na+/K+ ATPase; the two versions of the complex are found in different parts of the brain. Both versions play a critical role in the normal function of nerve cells (neurons). Na+/K+ ATPase transports charged atoms (ions) into and out of neurons, which is an essential part of the signaling process that controls muscle movement.  Mutations in the ATP1A3 or ATP1A2 gene reduce the activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase, impairing its ability to transport ions normally. It is unclear how a malfunctioning Na+/K+ ATPase causes the episodes of paralysis or uncontrollable movements characteristic of alternating hemiplegia of childhood.)

Answer: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is considered an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases of alternating hemiplegia of childhood result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. However, the condition can also run in families. For unknown reasons, the signs and symptoms are typically milder when the condition is found in multiple family members than when a single individual is affected.)

Answer: The first step in a substance treatment program is often detoxification (detox), the process of allowing the body to get rid of the substance. Detoxification under medical supervision allows the symptoms of withdrawal to be treated, but is not addiction treatment in and of itself. (Withdrawal is the sick, sometimes unbearable feeling that people have when trying to stop or cut down on a substance they have become addicted to or have been taking for a long time.)The type of withdrawal symptoms and how long they last vary with the substance abused. For example, withdrawal from certain stimulants may lead to fatigue, depression, and sleep problems. Unsupervised withdrawal from barbiturates and benzodiazepines can be dangerous.)

Answer: Different types of medications may be useful at different stages of treatment to help a person stop abusing a substance, stay in treatment, focus on learning new behavioral skills, and avoid relapse. Currently, medications are available to treat addiction to opiates, nicotine, and alcohol, but none are yet approved for treating addiction to stimulants, marijuana, or depressants. Medications for substance abuse treatment help the brain adjust to the absence of the abused substance. These medications act slowly to stave off drug cravings and prevent relapse. For example, buprenorphine, marketed as Subutex or Suboxone, is prescribed by approved physicians to treat people who are addicted to opiate drugs, such as painkillers or heroin. Buprenorphine is useful in the short-term detoxification process by helping ease withdrawal symptoms and in the long-term by staving off cravings and helping prevent relapse.

Answer: Although under federal law, marijuana is illegal to use under any circumstance, in some states doctors are allowed to prescribe it for medical use. However, solid data on marijuanas health benefits is lacking, and for smoked marijuana many health experts have concerns about the potential negative effects on the lungs and respiratory system.

Answer: Alternating hemiplegia is a rare neurological disorder that develops in childhood, most often before the child is 18 months old. The disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of paralysis that involve one or both sides of the body, multiple limbs, or a single limb. The paralysis may affect different parts of the body at different times and may be brief or last for several days. Oftentimes these episodes will resolve after sleep. Affected children may also have abnormal movements involving stiffening or ""dance-like"" movements of a limb, as well as walking and balance problems. Some children have seizures. Children may have normal or delayed development. There are both benign and more serious forms of the disorder. Most children do not have a family history of the disorder; however, recent studies have show that some children with a family history have mutations in the genes CACNA1A, SCN1A, and ATP1A2. Mutations in the ATP1A2 gene have previously been associated with families affect by familial hemiplegic migraine.)

Answer: Pain is the main symptom of fibromyalgia. It may be mild to severe.  - Painful areas are called tender points. Tender points are found in the soft tissue on the back of the neck, shoulders, chest, lower back, hips, shins, elbows, and knees. The pain then spreads out from these areas.  - The pain may feel like a deep ache, or a shooting, burning pain.  - The joints are not affected, although the pain may feel like it is coming from the joints.    People with fibromyalgia tend to wake up with body aches and stiffness. For some people, pain improves during the day and gets worse at night. Some people have pain all day long.  Pain may get worse with activity, cold or damp weather, anxiety, and stress.  Fatigue, depressed mood, and sleep problems occur in almost all people with fibromyalgia. Many people say that they cannot get to sleep or stay asleep, and they feel tired when they wake up.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001420.htm
Answer: Benign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It is caused by a problem in the inner ear.   The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. When you move, the fluid moves inside these tubes. The canals are very sensitive to any movement of the fluid. The sensation of the fluid moving in the tube tells your brain the position of your body. This helps you keep your balance.  BPPV occurs when a small piece of bone-like calcium breaks free and floats inside the tube. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position.  BPPV has no major risk factors. But, your risk for developing BPPV may increase if you have:  - Family members with BPPV  - Had a prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head)  - Had an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis)

Answer: Your health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your medical history.  To diagnose BPPV, your provider may perform a test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver.  - Your provider holds your head in a certain position. Then you are asked to lie quickly backward over a table.  - As you do this, your provider will look for abnormal eye movements and ask if you feel like you are spinning.    If this test doesn't show a clear result, you may be asked to do other tests.   You may have brain and nervous system (neurological) tests to rule out other causes. These may include:  - Electroencephalogram (EEG)  - Electronystagmography (ENG)  - Head CT  - Head MRI  - Hearing test  - Magnetic resonance angiography of the head  - Warming and cooling the inner ear with water or air to test eye movements.

Answer: Your doctor may have treated your vertigo with the Epley maneuver. These are head movements that correct the inner ear problem that causes BPPV. It usually works quickly.  - For the rest of the day, avoid bending over.  - For several days after treatment, avoid sleeping on the side that triggers symptoms.

Your doctor may prescribe medicines that can help relieve spinning sensations. However, these medicines often do not work well for treating vertigo.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000913.htm
Answer: New, improved treatments are helping persons with breast cancer live longer. Even with treatment, breast cancer can spread to other parts of the body. Sometimes, cancer returns even after the entire tumor has been removed and nearby lymph nodes are found to be cancer-free.  Some women who have had breast cancer develop a new breast cancer that is not related to the original tumor.  How well you do after being treated for breast cancer depends on many things. The more advanced your cancer, the poorer the outcome. Other factors that determine the risk of recurrence and the likelihood of successful treatment include:  - Location of the tumor and how far it has spread  - Whether the tumor is hormone receptor-positive or -negative  - Tumor markers  - Gene expression  - Tumor size and shape  - Rate of cell division or how quickly the tumor is growing    After considering all of the above, your doctor can discuss your risk of having a recurrence of breast cancer.)

ADAM_0003161_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Positioning your baby for breastfeeding (Also called: Breastfeeding positions; Bonding with your baby)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000634.htm
Answer: Summary : Be patient with yourself as you learn to breastfeed. Know that breastfeeding takes practice. Give yourself 2 to 3 weeks to get the hang of it.   Learn how to position your baby to breastfeed. Know how to hold your baby in different positions so your nipples do not get sore and so you empty your breasts of milk.

Breastfeeding Positions : You will be more comfortable nursing if you know how to position your baby on your breast. Find a position that works well for you and your baby. Learn about breastfeeding:  - Attend a breastfeeding class.  - Watch someone else breastfeed.  - Practice with an experienced nursing mother.  - Talk with a lactation consultant. A lactation consultant is an expert in breastfeeding. This person can teach you and your baby how to breastfeed. The consultant can help with positions and offer advice when your baby has trouble sucking.

Types of Breastfeeding Positions : CRADLE HOLD  This hold works best for full-term babies. Some new mothers have trouble guiding the baby's mouth to their breast in this hold. If you have had a cesarean birth (C-section), your baby may put too much pressure on your stomach in this hold.  Here's how to do the cradle hold:  - Sit in a comfortable chair with arm rests or a bed with pillows.  - Hold your baby on your lap, lying on the side so that the face, stomach, and knees are facing you.  - Tuck your baby's lower arm under your arm.  - If you are nursing on the right breast, hold your baby's head in the crook of your right arm. Use your arm and hand to support the neck, back, and bottom.  - Keep your baby's knees snug against your body.  - If your nipple hurts, see if your baby has slipped down and the knees are facing the ceiling instead of being tucked in next to your side. Adjust your baby's position if you need to.    FOOTBALL HOLD  Use the football hold if you had a C-section. This hold is good for babies that have trouble latching on because you can guide their head. Women with large breasts or flat nipples also like the football hold.  - Hold your baby like a football. Tuck the baby under the arm on the same side where you will nurse.  - Hold your baby at your side, under your arm.  - Cradle the back of your baby's head in your hand so the baby's nose is pointing at your nipple. The baby's feet and legs will be pointing back. Use your other hand to support your breast. Gently guide your baby to your nipple.    SIDE LYING POSITION  Use this position if you had a C-section or a hard delivery that makes it hard for you to sit up. You can use this position when you are lying in bed.  - Lie on your side.  - Lie your baby close to you with the baby's face at your breast. Pull your baby in snugly and place a pillow behind your baby's back to prevent backwards rolling.

Take Care of Your Nipples : Your nipples naturally make a lubricant to prevent drying, cracking, or infections. In order to keep your nipples healthy:  - Avoid soaps and harsh washing or drying of your breasts and nipples. This can cause dryness and cracking.  - Rub a little breast milk on your nipple after feeding to protect it. Keep your nipples dry to prevent cracking and infection.  - If you have cracked nipples, apply 100% pure lanolin after feedings.   - Try glycerin nipple pads that can be chilled and placed over your nipples to help soothe and heal cracked or painful nipples.

Alternate Names : Breastfeeding positions; Bonding with your baby)

Answer: There are two major types of beriberi:  - Wet beriberi affects the cardiovascular system.  - Dry beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome affect the nervous system.   Beriberi is rare in the United States because most foods are now vitamin enriched. If you eat a normal, healthy diet, you should get enough thiamine. Today, beriberi occurs mostly in patients who abuse alcohol. Drinking heavily can lead to poor nutrition. Excess alcohol makes it harder for the body to absorb and store thiamine.  A rare condition known as genetic beriberi is inherited (passed down through families). People with genetic beriberi lose the ability to absorb thiamine from foods. This can happen slowly over time and symptoms occur when the person is an adult. However, becausehealth care providersmay not consider beriberi in nonalcoholics, this diagnosis is often missed.  Beriberi can occur in breastfed infants when the mother's body is lacking in thiamine. The condition can also affect infants who are fed unusual formulas that don't have enough thiamine.  Getting dialysis and taking high doses of diuretics raise your risk of beriberi.)

Answer: Summary : When you have cancer, you need good nutrition to help keep your body strong. To do this you need to watch the foods you eat and how you prepare them.  Some raw foods can contain germs that can hurt you when cancer or treatment weakens your immune system. Ask your doctor or nurse about how to eat well but safely.  When you eat eggs:  - Yolks and whites should be cooked solid. Do not eat runny eggs.  - Do not eat foods that may have raw eggs in them (such as Caesar salad dressing, cookie dough, cake batter, and hollandaise sauce).    Be careful when you have dairy products:  - All milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy should have the word pasteurized on their containers.  - Do not eat soft cheeses or cheeses with blue veins (such as Brie, Camembert, Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola, and Bleu).  - Do not eat Mexican-style cheeses (such as queso blanco fresco and cojita).    Fruits and vegetables:  - Wash all raw fruits, vegetables, and fresh herbs with cold running water.  - Do not eat raw vegetable sprouts (such as alfalfa and mung bean).  - Do not use fresh salsa or salad dressings that are kept in the refrigerated cases of the grocery store.  - Drink only juice that says pasteurized on the container.    Do not eat raw honey. Eat only heat-treated honey. Avoid sweets that have creamy fillings.

Cook foods safely : When you cook, make sure you cook your food long enough.  Do not eat uncooked tofu. Cook tofu for at least 5 minutes.  When eating chicken and other poultry:  - Cook whole pieces of poultry to 180 F.  - Cook ground poultry to 165 F.    If you cook beef, lamb, pork, or venison:  - Do not eat raw mean, such as Japanese sashimi.  - Make sure meat is not red or pink before you eat it.  - Cook meat to 160 F.    When eating fish, oysters, and other shellfish:  - Do not eat raw fish (such as sushi), raw oysters, or any other raw shellfish.  - Make sure all fish and shellfish you eat is cooked thoroughly.    Heat all casseroles to 165 F. Warm hot dogs and lunch meats to steaming before you eat them.

Be careful when you eat out : When you dine out, stay away from:  - Raw fruits and vegetables  - Salad bars, buffets, sidewalk vendors, potlucks, and delis    Ask if all fruit juices are pasteurized.  Use only salad dressings, sauces, and salsas from single-serving packages. Eat out at times when restaurants are less crowded.

ADAM_0003452_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Safe sex
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001949.htm
Answer: Summary : Safe sex means taking steps before and during sex that can prevent you from getting an infection, or from giving an infection to your partner.

Information : A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that can be spread to another person through sexual contact. STIs include:  - Chlamydia  - Genital herpes  - Genital warts  - Gonorrhea  - Hepatitis  - HIV  - HPV  - Syphilis    STIs are also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  These infections are spread by direct contact with a sore on the genitals or mouth, body fluids, or sometimes the skin around the genital area.  Before having sex:  - Get to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories  - Don't feel forced into having sex  - Don't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner    Your sexual partner should be someone who you know does not have any STI. Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs and share the test results with each other.  If you know you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know this before you have sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.  Use condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.  - The condom should be in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.  - Keep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with skin areas around the genitals. A condom reduces but does not eliminate your risk of getting an STI.    Other tips include:   - Use lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.  - Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.  - Polyurethane condoms are less likely to break than latex condoms, but they cost more.  - Using condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may increase the chance of HIV transmission.  - Stay sober. Alcohol and drugs impair your judgment. When you are not sober, you might not choose your partner as carefully. You may also forget to use condoms, or use them incorrectly.    Get tested regularly for STIs if you have new sexual partners. Most STIs have no symptoms, so you need to be tested often if there is any chance you have been exposed. You will have the best outcome and will be less likely to spread the infection if you are diagnosed early.  Women should consider getting the HPV vaccine to keep from getting the human papillomavirus. This virus can put you at risk for vaginal warts and cervical cancer.)

ADAM_0004243_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Vitamin B12 level (Also called: Cobalamin test)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003705.htm
Answer: Summary : The vitamin B12 level is a blood test that measures how much vitamin B12 is in your blood.

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.

How to Prepare for the Test : You should not eat or drink for about 6 to 8 hours before the test.  Certain medicines may affect the results of this test. Your doctor will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines. Do not stop any medicine before talking to your doctor.  Medicines that can affect the test result include:  - Colchicine  - Neomycin  - Para-aminosalicylic acid  - Phenytoin

How the Test will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.

Why the Test is Performed : This test is most often done when other blood test tests suggest a condition called megaloblastic anemia. Pernicious anemia is a form of megaloblastic anemia caused by poor vitamin B12 absorption. This can occur when the stomach makes less of the substance the body needs to properly absorb vitamin B12.  Your doctor may also order a vitamin B12 test if you have certain nervous system symptoms. A low level of B12 can cause numbness or tingling in the arms and legs, weakness, and loss of balance.  Other conditions for which the test may be done:  - Sudden severe confusion (delirium)  - Loss of brain function (dementia)  - Dementia due to metabolic causes

Normal Results : Normal values are 200 - 900 picograms per milliliter (pg/mL).  Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your doctor about what your specific test results mean.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Values of less than 200 pg/mL are a sign of a vitamin B12 deficiency. People with this deficiency are likely to have or develop symptoms. Older adults with vitamin B12 levels between 200 and 500 pg/mL may also have symptoms.  Causes of vitamin B12 deficiency include:  - Not enough vitamin B12 in diet (rare, except with a strict vegetarian diet)  - Diseases that cause malabsorption (for example, celiac disease and Crohn disease)  - Lack of intrinsic factor, a protein that helps the intestine absorb vitamin B12  - Above normal heat production (for example, with hyperthyroidism)  - Pregnancy   A Schilling test can find the cause of a vitamin B12 deficiency.  An increased vitamin B12 level is uncommon. Usually, excess vitamin B12 is removed in the urine.  Conditions that can increase B12 level include:  - Liver disease (such as cirrhosis or hepatitis)  - Myeloproliferative disorders (for example, polycythemia vera and chronic myelocytic leukemia)

Risks : There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.  Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling light-headed  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken))

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ataxia-with-vitamin-e-deficiency
Answer: Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency is a disorder that impairs the body's ability to use vitamin E obtained from the diet. Vitamin E is an antioxidant, which means that it protects cells in the body from the damaging effects of unstable molecules called free radicals. A shortage (deficiency) of vitamin E can lead to neurological problems, such as difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) and speech (dysarthria), loss of reflexes in the legs (lower limb areflexia), and a loss of sensation in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy). Some people with this condition have developed an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa that causes vision loss. Most people who have ataxia with vitamin E deficiency start to experience problems with movement between the ages of 5 and 15 years. The movement problems tend to worsen with age.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/gas.html
Answer: Everyone has gas. Most people pass gas 13 to 21 times a day. Passing gas through the mouth is called belching or burping. Passing gas through the anus is called flatulence. Most of the time gas does not have an odor. The odor comes from bacteria in the large intestine that release small amounts of gases that contain sulfur.    Gas in the digestive tract comes from two sources: air that you swallow and the breakdown of undigested food by bacteria in the large intestine. Certain foods may cause gas. Foods that produce gas in one person may not cause gas in another.    You can reduce the amount of gas you have by       - Drinking lots of water and non-fizzy drinks    - Eating more slowly so you swallow less air when you eat    - Avoiding milk products if you have lactose intolerance       Medicines can help reduce gas or the pain and bloating caused by gas.

Answer: Gas can be caused by certain foods you eat. You may have gas if you:  - Eat foods that are hard to digest, such as fiber. Sometimes, adding more fiber into your diet can cause temporary gas. Your body may adjust and stop producing gas over time.  - Eat or drink something your body cannot tolerate. For example, some people have lactose intolerance and cannot eat or drink dairy products.    Other common causes of gas are:  - Antibiotics  - Irritable bowel syndrome  - Inability to absorb nutrients properly (malabsorption)  - Inability to digest nutrients properly (maldigestion)  - Swallowing air while eating)

ADAM_0000179_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Am I in labor? (Also called: False labor; Braxton Hicks contractions; Prodromal labor; Latent labor; Pregnancy - labor)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000508.htm
Answer: Summary : If you've never given birth before, you may think you'll just know when the time comes. In reality, it isn't always easy to know when you're going into labor. The steps leading up to labor can drag on for days.  Keep in mind that your due date is just a general idea of when your labor may start. Normal term labor can start any time between 3 weeks before and 2 weeks after this date.

False labor (Braxton Hicks contractions) : Most pregnant women feel mild contractions before true labor begins. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions, which:  - Are typically short  - Are not painful  - Do not come at regular intervals  - Are not accompanied by bleeding, leaking fluid, or decreased fetal movement    This stage is called ""prodromal"" or ""latent"" labor.

Other signs that labor is near : Lightening: This happens when your baby's head ""drops"" down into your pelvis.   - Your belly will look lower. It will be easier for you to breathe because the baby is not putting pressure on your lungs.  - You may need to urinate more often because the baby is pressing on your bladder.  - For first-time mothers, lightening often happens a few weeks before birth. For women who have had babies before, it may not happen until labor has begun.    Bloody show: If you have bloody or brownish discharge from your vagina, it may mean your cervix has begun to dilate. The mucous plug that sealed your cervix for the last 9 months may be visible. This is a good sign. But active labor may still be days away.   Your baby moves less: If you feel less movement, call your doctor or midwife, as sometimes decreased movement can mean that the baby is in trouble.   Your water breaks: When the amniotic sac (bag of fluid around the baby) breaks, you will feel fluid leak from your vagina. It may come out in a trickle or a gush.   - For most women, contractions come within 24 hours after the bag of water breaks.  - Even if contractions don't begin, let your doctor or midwife know as soon as you think your water has broken.    Diarrhea: Some women have the urge to go to the bathroom often to empty their bowels. If this happens and your stools are looser than normal, you may be going into labor.   Nesting: There's no science behind the theory, but plenty of women feel the sudden urge to ""nest"" right before labor starts. If you feel the need to vacuum the entire house at 3 a.m., or finish your work in the baby's nursery, you may be getting ready for labor.

True labor : In real labor, your contractions will:   - Come regularly and get closer together  - Last from 30 to 70 seconds, and will get longer  - Not stop, no matter what you do  - Radiate (reach) into your lower back and upper belly  - Get stronger or become more intense as time goes on  - Make you unable to talk to other people or laugh at a joke

When to call the doctor or midwife : Call your doctor or midwife right away if you have:   - Leaking amniotic fluid  - Decreased fetal movement  - Any vaginal bleeding other than light spotting  - Regular, painful contractions every 5 to 10 minutes for 60 minutes   Call for any other reason if you are unsure what to do.)

CDC_0000054_Sec7.txt,"Question: how can botulism be prevented?
URL: http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/botulism/
Answer: Many cases of botulism are preventable. Foodborne botulism has often been from home-canned foods with low acid content, such as asparagus, green beans, beets and corn and is caused by failure to follow proper canning methods. However, seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade, with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture, at retail, or by consumers; some examples are chopped garlic in oil, canned cheese sauce, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice, and baked potatoes wrapped in foil. In Alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods. Persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods, and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners/cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the US Department of Agriculture. Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs. Most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust.  The bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.  Honey can contain the bacteria that causes infant botulism so, children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey. Honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and older.)

CDC_0000212_Sec3.txt,"Question: how can hps be prevented for Hantavirus ?
URL: http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/
Answer: Eliminate or minimize contact with rodents in your home, workplace, or campsite. If rodents don't find that where you are is a good place for them to be, then you're less likely to come into contact with them. Seal up holes and gaps in your home or garage. Place traps in and around your home to decrease rodent infestation. Clean up any easy-to-get food.
  
Recent research results show that many people who became ill with HPS developed the disease after having been in frequent contact with rodents and/or their droppings around a home or a workplace. On the other hand, many people who became ill reported that they had not seen rodents or rodent droppings at all. Therefore, if you live in an area where the carrier rodents are known to live, try to keep your home, vacation place, workplace, or campsite clean.

NIHSeniorHealth_0000062_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Shingles ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/shingles/toc.html
Answer: Shingles is a painful rash that develops on one side of the face or body. The rash forms blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days and clear up within 2 to 4 weeks. Most commonly, the rash occurs in a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash occurs on one side of the face. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread and look similar to a chickenpox rash. Shingles is very common. Fifty percent of all Americans will have had shingles by the time they are 80. While shingles occurs in people of all ages, it is most common in 60- to 80-year-olds. In fact, one out of every three people 60 years or older will get shingles. (Watch the video to learn more about shingles. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) What Causes Shingles? Shingles is caused by a reactivation of the chickenpox virus. It is distinctive because it affects only one side of the body. The early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages: severe pain or tingling, possibly itchy rash, and blisters that look like chickenpox. The virus that causes shingles is a herpes virus, (Another name for shingles is herpes zoster.) Once you are infected with this kind of virus, it remains in your body for life. It stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. Shingles and Pain The most common complication of shingles is pain -- a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). People with PHN have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash, even after the rash clears up. In most patients, the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months, but some people can have pain from PHN for years. Persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. In fact, one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain. As people get older, they are more likely to develop long-term pain as a complication of shingles and the pain is likely to be more severe. Other Complications Shingles may also lead to other serious complications. - Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected.  -  Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring.  Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected. Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring. - In a very small number of cases, bacteria can cause more serious conditions, including toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection that destroys the soft tissue under the skin.  - The burning waves of pain, loss of sleep, and interference with even basic life activities can cause serious depression.  - In patients with immune deficiency, the rash can be much more extensive than usual and the illness can be complicated by pneumonia. These cases are more serious, but they are rarely fatal.  - Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death.

Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death. Shingles Usually Does Not Return People who develop shingles usually have only one episode in their lifetime. However, a person can have a second or even a third episode. The Shingles Vaccine Adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. The vaccine can reduce your risk of shingles and the long-term pain it can cause. If you have already had shingles or you have a chronic medical condition, you can receive the shingles vaccine. (See more about the shingles vaccine in the chapter Prevention.) Is Shingles Contagious? Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. If You Have Shingles If you have shingles, - keep the rash covered  - avoid touching or scratching the rash  - wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.  keep the rash covered avoid touching or scratching the rash wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus. Until your rash has developed crusts, avoid contact with - pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine  - premature or low birth weight infants  - people with weakened immune systems, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine premature or low birth weight infants people with weakened immune systems, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. If you have not had chickenpox and you come into contact with someone who has shingles, ask your healthcare provider whether you should get a chickenpox vaccination.

URL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/shingles/shingles.htm
Answer: Shingles (herpes zoster) is an outbreak of rash or blisters on the skin that is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox  the varicella-zoster virus. The first sign of shingles is often burning or tingling pain (which can be severe), or sometimes numbness or itch,generally on one side of the body. After several days or a week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters, similar to chickenpox, appears in one area on one side of the body. Shingles pain can be mild or intense. Some people have mostly itching; some feel pain from the gentlest touch or breeze. The most common location for shingles is a band, called a dermatome, spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline. Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles. Scientists think that some of the virus particles from the original exposure to the varicella-zoster virus,leave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system. When the varicella-zoster virus reactivates, the virus moves back down the long nerve fibers that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin. The viruses multiply, the tell-tale rash erupts, and the person now has shingles.)

NIHSeniorHealth_0000062_Sec11.txt,"Question: What causes Shingles ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/shingles/toc.html
Answer: Shingles is caused by a virus called the varicella-zoster virus -- the one that gave you chickenpox when you were a child. As you recovered from chickenpox, the sores and other symptoms healed, but the virus remained. It is with you for life. Researchers know that the varicella-zoster virus behaves differently from other viruses, such as the flu virus. Our immune system usually kills off invading germs, but it cannot completely knock out this type of virus. The virus just becomes inactive. The virus can become active again, especially in the later years of your life when your immune system doesn't protect you as well from infections. The virus travels from the spinal nerve cells and follows a nerve path out to the skin. Nerve endings in the skin become inflamed and erupt in a very painful rash. Healthcare providers cannot always be sure what the trigger is in each case. They don't know why the virus reactivates in one person with these risk factors, while in another person with the same risk factors, it does not.)

As you recovered from chickenpox, the sores healed and the other symptoms went away, but the virus remained. It is with you for life. The virus hides out in nerve cells, usually in the spine. But it can become active again. Somehow, the virus gets a signal that your immunity has become weakened. This triggers the reactivation. When the virus becomes active again, it follows a nerve path called a dermatome. The nerve path begins at specific points in the spine, continues around one side of the body, and surfaces at the nerve endings in the skin. The pattern of the rash reflects the location of that nerve path. Risk Factors The leading risk factor for shingles is a history of having had chickenpox. One out of every five people who have had chickenpox is likely to get shingles. Another risk factor is aging. As we age, our natural immunity gradually loses its ability to protect against infection. The shingles virus can take advantage of this and become active again. Conditions that weaken the immune system can also put people at risk for shingles. Shingles is especially dangerous for anyone who has had cancer, radiation treatments for cancer, HIV/AIDS, or a transplant operation. Stress is another factor that may contribute to outbreaks. While stress alone does not cause the outbreaks, shingles often occurs in people who have recently had a stressful event in their lives. Most cases of shingles occur in adults. Only about 5 percent of cases occur in children. With children, immune deficiency is the primary risk factor, but children who had chickenpox before they were one year old may also get shingles before they become adults. There have been studies of adults who had chickenpox as children and were later exposed to children who had chickenpox. Interestingly, that exposure apparently boosted the adult's immunity, which actually helped them avoid getting shingles later in life.)

Answer: Shingles -- also called varicella-zoster -- is a painful skin disease caused by a reactivation of the chickenpox virus. It is distinctive because it affects only one side of the body. The early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages: severe pain or tingling, possibly itchy rash, and blisters that look like chickenpox. (Watch the video to learn more about shingles.

Answer: Shingles (herpes zoster) is an outbreak of rash or blisters on the skin that is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox  the varicella-zoster virus. The first sign of shingles is often burning or tingling pain (which can be severe), or sometimes numbness or itch,generally on one side of the body. After several days or a week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters, similar to chickenpox, appears in one area on one side of the body. Shingles pain can be mild or intense. Some people have mostly itching; some feel pain from the gentlest touch or breeze. The most common location for shingles is a band, called a dermatome, spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline. Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles. Scientists think that some of the virus particles from the original exposure to the varicella-zoster virus,leave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system. When the varicella-zoster virus reactivates, the virus moves back down the long nerve fibers that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin. The viruses multiply, the tell-tale rash erupts, and the person now has shingles.)

Answer: Do not touch the rash and blisters on persons with shingles or chickenpox if you have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine.  A herpes zoster vaccine is available. It is different than the chickenpox vaccine. Older adults who receive the herpes zoster vaccine are less likely to have complications from shingles.)

Answer: Yes. In May 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a vaccine to prevent shingles in people age 60 and older. The vaccine, called Zostavax, is designed to boost the immune system and protect older adults from getting shingles later on. Even if you have had shingles, you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. There is no maximum age for getting the vaccine, and only a single dose is recommended. The shingles vaccine is NOT recommended if you have active shingles or pain that continues after the rash is gone. (Watch the video to learn more about shingles treatments.

Answer: Shingles is a painful rash that develops on one side of the face or body. The rash forms blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days and clear up within 2 to 4 weeks. Most commonly, the rash occurs in a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash occurs on one side of the face. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread and look similar to a chickenpox rash. Shingles is very common. Fifty percent of all Americans will have had shingles by the time they are 80. While shingles occurs in people of all ages, it is most common in 60- to 80-year-olds. In fact, one out of every three people 60 years or older will get shingles. (Watch the video to learn more about shingles. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) What Causes Shingles? Shingles is caused by a reactivation of the chickenpox virus. It is distinctive because it affects only one side of the body. The early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages: severe pain or tingling, possibly itchy rash, and blisters that look like chickenpox. The virus that causes shingles is a herpes virus, (Another name for shingles is herpes zoster.) Once you are infected with this kind of virus, it remains in your body for life. It stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. Shingles and Pain The most common complication of shingles is pain -- a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). People with PHN have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash, even after the rash clears up. In most patients, the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months, but some people can have pain from PHN for years. Persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. In fact, one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain. As people get older, they are more likely to develop long-term pain as a complication of shingles and the pain is likely to be more severe. Other Complications Shingles may also lead to other serious complications. - Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected.  -  Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring.  Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected. Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring. - In a very small number of cases, bacteria can cause more serious conditions, including toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection that destroys the soft tissue under the skin.  - The burning waves of pain, loss of sleep, and interference with even basic life activities can cause serious depression.  - In patients with immune deficiency, the rash can be much more extensive than usual and the illness can be complicated by pneumonia. These cases are more serious, but they are rarely fatal.  - Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death.

Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death. Shingles Usually Does Not Return People who develop shingles usually have only one episode in their lifetime. However, a person can have a second or even a third episode. The Shingles Vaccine Adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. The vaccine can reduce your risk of shingles and the long-term pain it can cause. If you have already had shingles or you have a chronic medical condition, you can receive the shingles vaccine. (See more about the shingles vaccine in the chapter Prevention.) Is Shingles Contagious? Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. If You Have Shingles If you have shingles, - keep the rash covered  - avoid touching or scratching the rash  - wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.  keep the rash covered avoid touching or scratching the rash wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus. Until your rash has developed crusts, avoid contact with - pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine  - premature or low birth weight infants  - people with weakened immune systems, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine premature or low birth weight infants people with weakened immune systems, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Answer: A Vaccine for Adults 60 and Older In May 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a vaccine (Zostavax) to prevent shingles in people age 60 and older. The vaccine is designed to boost the immune system and protect older adults from getting shingles later on. Even if you have had shingles, you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. There is no maximum age for getting the vaccine, and only a single dose is recommended. In a clinical trial involving thousands of adults 60 years old or older, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by about half. A One-time Dose To reduce the risk of shingles, adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. Even if the shingles vaccine doesnt prevent you from getting shingles, it can still reduce the chance of having long-term pain. If you have had shingles before, you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. There is no maximum age for getting the vaccine. Side Effects Vaccine side effects are usually mild and temporary. In most cases, shingles vaccine causes no serious side effects. Some people experience mild reactions that last up to a few days, such as headache or redness, soreness, swelling, or itching where the shot was given. When To Get the Vaccine The decision on when to get vaccinated should be made with your health care provider. The shingles vaccine is not recommended if you have active shingles or pain that continues after the rash is gone. Although there is no specific time that you must wait after having shingles before receiving the shingles vaccine, you should generally make sure that the shingles rash has disappeared before getting vaccinated. Where To Get the Vaccine The shingles vaccine is available in doctors offices, pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics, and health departments. Most private health insurance plans cover recommended vaccines. Check with your insurance provider for details and for a list of vaccine providers. Medicare Part D plans cover shingles vaccine, but there may be costs to you depending on your specific plan. If you do not have health insurance, visit www.healthcare.gov  to learn more about health insurance options. Who Should Not Get the Vaccine? You should NOT get the shingles vaccine if you - have an active case of shingles or have pain that continues after the rash is gone  - have ever had a life-threatening or severe allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of the shingles vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.  - have a weakened immune system because of:  -- HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system   -- treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids   -- cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy   -- cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma.  have an active case of shingles or have pain that continues after the rash is gone have ever had a life-threatening or severe allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of the shingles vaccine.

To learn more about the vaccine, see Zostavax: Questions and Answers.  Could Vaccines Make Shingles a Rare Disease? The shingles vaccine is basically a stronger version of the chickenpox vaccine, which became available in 1995. The chickenpox shot prevents chickenpox in 70 to 90 percent of those vaccinated, and 95 percent of the rest have only mild symptoms. Millions of children and adults have already received the chickenpox shot. Interestingly, the chickenpox vaccine may reduce the shingles problem. Widespread use of the chickenpox vaccine means that fewer people will get chickenpox in the future. And if people do not get chickenpox, they cannot get shingles. Use of the shingles and chickenpox vaccines may one day make shingles a rare disease. To find out more, visit Shingles Vaccination: What You Need to Know or  Shingles Vaccine))

ADAM_0002917_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Pain medications - narcotics ? (Also called: Painkillers; Drugs for pain; Analgesics; Opioids)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007489.htm
Answer: Narcotics are also called opioid pain relievers. They are used only for pain that is severe and is not helped by other types of painkillers. When used carefully and under a health care provider's direct care, these drugs can be effective at reducing pain.  Narcotics work by binding to receptors in the brain, which blocks the feeling of pain.  You should not use a narcotic drug for more than 3 to 4 months, unless you are under direct care of your provider.  NAMES OF NARCOTICS  - Codeine  - Fentanyl -- available as a patch  - Hydrocodone  - Hydromorphone  - Meperidine  - Morphine  - Oxycodone  - Tramadol   TAKING NARCOTICS  These drugs can be abused and habit-forming. They have been associated with accidental overdose deaths. Always take narcotics as prescribed. Your provider may suggest that you take your medicine only when you feel pain.  Or, your doctor may suggest taking a narcotic on a regular schedule. Allowing the medicine to wear off before taking more of it can make the pain difficult to control.   Taking narcotics to control the pain of cancer or other medical problems does not itself lead to dependence.  Store narcotics safely and securely in your home.  You may need a pain specialist to help you manage long-term pain.  SIDE EFFECTS OF NARCOTICS  Drowsiness and impaired judgment often occur with these medicines. When taking a narcotic, do not drink alcohol, drive, or operate heavy machinery.  You can relieve itching by reducing the dose or talking to your doctor about switching medicines.  To help with constipation, drink more fluids, get more exercise, eat foods with extra fiber, and use stool softeners.  If nausea or vomiting occur, try taking the narcotic with food.  Withdrawal symptoms are common when you stop taking a narcotic. Symptoms include strong desire for the medicine (craving), yawning, insomnia, restlessness, mood swings, or diarrhea. To prevent withdrawal symptoms, your doctor may recommend you gradually lower the dosage over time.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000170.htm
Answer: Peripheral artery disease is caused by arteriosclerosis, or ""hardening of the arteries."" This problem occurs when fatty material (plaque) builds up on the walls of your arteries and makes them narrower. The walls of the arteries also become stiffer and cannot widen (dilate) to allow greater blood flow when needed.   As a result, the muscles of your legs cannot get enough blood and oxygen when they are working harder (such as during exercise or walking). If PAD becomes severe, there may not be enough blood and oxygen, even when the muscles are resting.  Peripheral artery disease is a common disorder. It most often affects men over age 50, but women can have it as well. People are at higher risk if they have a history of:  - Abnormal cholesterol  - Diabetes  - Heart disease (coronary artery disease)  - High blood pressure (hypertension)  - Kidney disease involving hemodialysis  - Smoking  - Stroke (cerebrovascular disease))

Common causes of cramps include:  - Dehydration or low amounts of potassium, sodium, calcium, or magnesium in the blood  - Medicines (such as diuretics and statins)  - Muscle fatigue or strain from overuse, too much exercise, or holding a muscle in the same position for a long time    An injury can also cause leg pain from:  - A torn or overstretched muscle (strain)  - Hairline crack in the bone (stress fracture)  - Inflamed tendon (tendinitis)  - Shin splints (pain in the front of the leg from overuse)    Other common causes of leg pain include:  - Atherosclerosis that blocks blood flow in the arteries (this type of pain, called claudication, is generally felt when exercising or walking and is relieved by rest)  - Blood clot (deep vein thrombosis) from long-term bed rest  - Infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) or skin and soft tissue (cellulitis)  - Inflammation of the leg joints caused by arthritis or gout  - Nerve damagecommonto people with diabetes, smokers, and alcoholics  - Varicose veins   Less common causes include:  - Cancerous bone tumors (osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma)  - Legg-Calve-Perthes disease:Poor blood flow to the hip that may stop or slow the normal growth of the leg  - Noncancerous (benign) tumors or cysts of the femur or tibia (osteoid osteoma)  - Sciatic nerve pain (radiating pain down the leg) caused by a slipped disk in the back  - Slipped capital femoral epiphysis: Most often seen in boys and overweight children between ages 11 and 15)

ADAM_0002557_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Medications for back pain ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007486.htm
Answer: Back pain often goes away on its own over several weeks. In some people, back pain persists. It may not go away completely or it may get more painful at times.  Medicines can also help with your back pain.  OVER-THE-COUNTER PAIN RELIEVERS  Over-the-counter means you can buy them without a prescription.  Most health care providers recommend acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) first because it has fewer side effects than other drugs. Do not take more than 3 grams (3,000 mg) on any one day or 24 hours. Overdosing onacetaminophen can cause severe damage to your liver. If you already have liver disease, ask your doctor if acetaminophen isOK for you to take.  If your pain continues, your provider may suggest nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). You can buy some NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, without a prescription.NSAIDs help reduce the swelling around the swollen disc or arthritis in the back.  NSAIDs and acetaminophen in high doses, or if taken for a long time, can cause serious side effects. Side effects include stomach pain,ulcers or bleeding, and liver or kidney damage. If side effectsoccur, stop taking the drug right away and tell your provider.  If you are taking pain relievers for more than a week, tell your provider. You may need to be watched for side effects.   NARCOTIC PAIN RELIEVERS   Narcotics, also called opioid pain relievers, are used only for pain that is severe and is not helped by other types of painkillers. They work well for short-term relief. Do not use them for more than 3to 4 weeksunless instructed by your provider to do so.  Narcotics work by binding to receptors in the brain, which blocks the feeling of pain. These drugs can be abused and are habit-forming. They have been associated with accidental overdose and death. When used carefully and under a provider's direct care, they can be effectivein reducing pain.  Examples of narcotics include:  - Codeine  - Fentanyl -- available as a patch  - Hydrocodone  - Hydromorphone  - Morphine  - Oxycodone  - Tramadol   Possible side effects of these drugs include:  - Drowsiness  - Impaired judgment  - Nausea or vomiting  - Constipation  - Itching   - Slowed breathing   When taking narcotics, do not drink alcohol, drive, or operate heavy machinery.   MUSCLE RELAXANTS   Your provider may prescribe a medicine called a muscle relaxant. Despiteits name,it does not work directly on muscles. Instead,it works through your brain and spinal cord.  This drug isoften given along with over-the-counter pain relievers to relieve the symptoms of back pain or muscle spasm.  Examples of muscle relaxants include:  - Carisoprodol  - Cyclobenzaprine  - Diazepam  - Methocarbamol   Side effectsof muscle relaxants are common and include drowsiness, confusion, nausea, and vomiting.  These medicines can be habit-forming. Talk to your provider before using these drugs. They may interact with other medicines or make certain medical conditions worse.  Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking muscle relaxants.Do not drink alcohol while taking these drugs.   ANTIDEPRESSANTS   Antidepressants are normally used to treat people with depression. But, low doses of these medicines can help with chronic low back pain, even if the persondoes not feel sad or depressed.  These drugs work by changing the levels of certain chemicals in your brain. This changes the way your brain notices pain. Antidepressants most commonly used for chronic low back pain also help you sleep.  Antidepressants most often used for back pain are:  - Amitriptyline  - Desipramine  - Duloxetine  - Imipramine  - Nortriptyline   Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, weight gain, sleepiness, problems urinating, and sexual problems. Less commonly, some of these drugs can alsocause heart and lung problems.  Do not take these drugs unless you are under the care of a provider. Do not stop taking these drugs suddenly or change the dose without also talking with yourprovider.   ANTI-SEIZURE OR ANTICONVULSANT MEDICINES   Anticonvulsant medicines are used to treat people with seizures or epilepsy. They work by causing changes in the electric signals in the brain. They work best for pain that is caused by nerve damage.  These drugs may help some people whose long-term back pain has made it hard for them to work, or pain thatinterferes with their daily activities.  Anticonvulsants most often used to treat chronic pain are:  - Carbamazepine  - Gabapentin  - Lamotrigine  - Pregabalin  - Valproic acid   Common side effects include weight gain or weight loss, upset stomach, loss of appetite, skin rashes, drowsiness or feeling confused, and headaches.  Do not take these drugs unless you are under aprovider's care. Do not stop taking these drugs suddenly or change the dose without also talking with yourprovider.)

Answer: Summary : Pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve headaches, sore muscles, arthritis, or other aches and pains. There are many different pain medicines, and each one has advantages and risks. Some types of pain respond better to certain medicines than others. Each person may also have a slightly different response to a pain reliever.     Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are good for many types of pain. There are two main types of OTC pain medicines: acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin, naproxen (Aleve), and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) are examples of OTC NSAIDs.    If OTC medicines don't relieve your pain, your doctor may prescribe something stronger. Many NSAIDs are also available at higher prescription doses. The most powerful pain relievers are narcotics. They are very effective, but they can sometimes have serious side effects. Because of the risks, you must use them only under a doctor's supervision.    There are many things you can do to help ease pain. Pain relievers are just one part of a pain treatment plan.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002064.htm
Answer: Summary : Alternative medicine refers to treatments that are used instead of conventional (standard) ones. If you use an alternative treatment along with conventional medicine or therapy, it is considered complementary therapy.  There are many forms of alternative medicine.  Acupuncture involves stimulating certain acupoints on the body using fine needles or other methods. How acupuncture works is not entirely clear. It is thought that acupoints lie near nerve fibers. When acupoints are stimulated, the nerve fibers signal the spinal cord and brain to release chemicals that relieve pain.   Acupuncture is an effective means of relieving pain, such as for back pain and headache pain. Acupuncture may also help relieve pain due to:  - Cancer  - Carpal tunnel syndrome  - Fibromyalgia  - Childbirth (labor)  - Musculoskeletal injuries (such as the neck, shoulder, knee, or elbow)  - Osteoarthritis  - Rheumatoid arthritis   Hypnosis is a focused state of concentration. With self-hypnosis, you repeat a positive statement over and over.  Hypnosis may help relieve pain for:  - After surgery or labor  - Arthritis  - Cancer  - Fibromyalgia  - Irritable bowel syndrome  - Migraine headache  - Tension headache   Both acupuncture and hypnosis are often offered by pain management centers in the United States. Other non-drug methods used at such centers include:  - Biofeedback  - Massage  - Relaxation training  - Physical therapy)

Answer: Treatment depends on the type of thyroid cancer.   Surgery is most often done. The entire thyroid gland is usually removed. If the doctor suspects that the cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the neck, these will also be removed.  Radiation therapy may be done with or without surgery. It may be performed by:  - Aiming external beam (x-ray) radiation at the thyroid  - Taking radioactive iodine by mouth    After treatment for thyroid cancer, you must take thyroid hormone pills for the rest of your life. The dosage is usually slightly higher than what your body needs. This helps keep the cancer from coming back. The pills also replace the thyroid hormone your body needs to function normally.  If the cancer does not respond to surgery or radiation, and has spread to other parts of the body, chemotherapy may be used. This is only effective for a small number of patients.)

Answer: Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck, just above your collarbone. It makes hormones that help the body work normally. There are several types of cancer of the thyroid gland. You are at greater risk if you       - Are between ages 25 and 65    - Are a woman    - Are Asian    - Have a family member who has had thyroid disease    - Have had radiation treatments to your head or neck       You should see a doctor if you have a lump or swelling in your neck. Doctors use a physical exam, blood tests, imaging tests, and a biopsy to diagnose thyroid cancer. Treatment depends on the type of cancer you have and how far the cancer has spread. Many patients receive a combination of treatments. They may include surgery, radioactive iodine, hormone treatment, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy.

Answer: A urine analysis may show high blood sugar. But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes.  Your health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 mg/dL. To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done.  Blood tests:  - Fasting blood glucose level: Diabetes is diagnosed ifthe fasting glucose levelis higher than 126 mg/dL on 2 different tests. Levels between 100 and 126 mg/dL are called impaired fasting glucose or pre-diabetes. These levels are risk factors for type 2 diabetes.  - Hemoglobin A1c(A1C) test: Normal is less than 5.7%; prediabetes is 5.7 to 6.4%; and diabetes is 6.5% or higher.   - Oral glucose tolerance test: Diabetes is diagnosed if the glucose level is higher than 200 mg/dL 2 hoursafter drinking asugar drink (This test is used more often for type 2 diabetes).   Screening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for:  - Overweight children who have other risk factors for diabetes, starting at age 10 and repeated every3 years  - Overweight adults (BMI of 25 or higher) who have other risk factors  - Adults over age 45, repeated every 3 years)

Answer: Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.  To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested:  - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.  - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.     People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the bloodinto muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and because their liver makestoo much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:  - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin  - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally  - Both of the above    There are 2 major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:   - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown.  - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease.Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should.  - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2.    Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.  If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/diabetes.html
Answer: Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes.    Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes.    Blood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test, the A1C, can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Exercise, weight control and sticking to your meal plan can help control your diabetes. You should also monitor your blood glucose level and take medicine if prescribed.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)

Answer: Heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death for people with diabetes. Controlling the ABCs of diabetes -- your blood glucose, your blood pressure, and your cholesterol, as well as stopping smoking -- can help prevent these and other complications from diabetes. -  A is for the A1C test  -  B is for Blood pressure  -  C is for Cholesterol. A is for the A1C test B is for Blood pressure C is for Cholesterol. - The A1C test (A-one-C) shows you what your blood glucose has been over the last three months. Your health care provider does this test to see what your blood glucose level is most of the time. This test should be done at least twice a year for all people with diabetes and for some people more often as needed. For many people with diabetes, an A1C test result of under 7 percent usually means that their diabetes treatment is working well and their blood glucose is under control.

Answer: Too Much Glucose in the Blood Diabetes means your blood glucose (often called blood sugar) is too high. Your blood always has some glucose in it because your body needs glucose for energy to keep you going. But too much glucose in the blood isn't good for your health. Glucose comes from the food you eat and is also made in your liver and muscles. Your blood carries the glucose to all of the cells in your body. Insulin is a chemical (a hormone) made by the pancreas. The pancreas releases insulin into the blood. Insulin helps the glucose from food get into your cells. If your body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin doesn't work the way it should, glucose can't get into your cells. It stays in your blood instead. Your blood glucose level then gets too high, causing pre-diabetes or diabetes. Types of Diabetes There are three main kinds of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. The result of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is the same: glucose builds up in the blood, while the cells are starved of energy. Over the years, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, oftentimes leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, nerve problems, gum infections, and amputation. Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes, which used to be called called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, develops most often in young people. However, type 1 diabetes can also develop in adults. With this form of diabetes, your body no longer makes insulin or doesnt make enough insulin because your immune system has attacked and destroyed the insulin-producing cells. About 5 to 10 percent of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. To survive, people with type 1 diabetes must have insulin delivered by injection or a pump. Learn more about type 1 diabetes here. Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes, which used to be called adult-onset diabetes or non insulin-dependent diabetes, is the most common form of diabetes. Although people can develop type 2 diabetes at any age -- even during childhood -- type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistancea condition that occurs when fat, muscle, and liver cells do not use insulin to carry glucose into the bodys cells to use for energy. As a result, the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. At first, the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by making more insulin. Over time, the pancreas doesnt make enough insulin when blood sugar levels increase, such as after meals. If your pancreas can no longer make enough insulin, you will need to treat your type 2 diabetes. Learn more about type 2 diabetes here. Gestational Diabetes Some women develop gestational diabetes during the late stages of pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is caused by the hormones of pregnancy or a shortage of insulin. Although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had it and her child are more likely to develop diabetes later in life. Prediabetes Prediabetes means your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. People with prediabetes are at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes and for heart disease and stroke. The good news is that if you have prediabetes, you can reduce your risk of getting type 2 diabetes. With modest weight loss and moderate physical activity, you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.  Learn more about prediabetes here.  Signs of Diabetes Many people with diabetes experience one or more symptoms, including extreme thirst or hunger, a frequent need to urinate and/or fatigue. Some lose weight without trying. Additional signs include sores that heal slowly, dry, itchy skin, loss of feeling or tingling in the feet and blurry eyesight. Some people with diabetes, however, have no symptoms at all. How Many Have Diabetes? Nearly 29 million Americans age 20 or older (12.3 percent of all people in this age group) have diabetes, according to 2014 estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 1.9 million people aged 20 years or older were newly diagnosed with diabetes in 2010 alone. People can get diabetes at any age, but the risk increases as we get older. In 2014, over 11 million older adults living in the U.S -- nearly 26 percent of people 65 or older -- had diabetes. See more statistics about diabetes from the  National Diabetes Statistics Report 2014. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) If Diabetes is Not Managed Diabetes is a very serious disease. Over time, diabetes that is not well managed causes serious damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, gums and teeth. If you have diabetes, you are more likely than people without diabetes to have heart disease or a stroke. People with diabetes also tend to develop heart disease or stroke at an earlier age than others. The best way to protect yourself from the serious complications of diabetes is to manage your blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol and to avoid smoking. It is not always easy, but people who make an ongoing effort to manage their diabetes can greatly improve their overall health.)

Answer: Studies have shown that most people with prediabetes develop type 2 diabetes within a few years, unless they change their lifestyle. Most people with prediabetes dont have any symptoms. Your doctor can test your blood to find out if your blood glucose levels are higher than normal. Losing weightat least 5 to 10 percent of your starting weightcan prevent or delay diabetes or even reverse prediabetes. Thats 10 to 20 pounds for someone who weighs 200 pounds. You can lose weight by cutting the amount of calories and fat you consume and by being physically active at least 30 to 60 minutes every day. Physical activity also helps your body use the hormone insulin properly. Your body needs insulin to use glucose for energy. Medicine can help control the amount of glucose in your blood.

Answer: Summary : Your health care provider may ask you to keep track of your blood pressure at home. To do this, you will need to get a home blood pressure monitor. The monitor you choose should be of good quality and fit well.  MANUAL BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORS  - Manual devices include a cuff that wraps around your arm, a rubber squeeze bulb, and a gauge that measures the blood pressure. A stethoscope is needed to listen to the blood pulsing through the artery.  - You can see your blood pressure on the circular dial of the gauge as the needle moves around and the pressure in the cuff rises or falls.  - When used correctly, manual devices are very accurate. However, they are not the recommended type of blood pressure monitor for home use.    DIGITAL BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORS  - A digital device will also have a cuff that wraps around your arm. To inflate the cuff, you may need to use a rubber squeeze ball. Other kinds will inflate automatically when you push a button.  - After the cuff is inflated, the pressure will slowly drop on its own. The screen will show a digital readout of your systolic and diastolic blood pressure.  - After showing your blood pressure, the cuff will deflate on its own. With most machines, you must wait for 2 to 3 minutes before using it again.  - A digital blood pressure monitor will not be as accurate if your body is moving when you are using it. Also, an irregular heart rate will make the reading less accurate. However, digital monitors are the best choice for most people.    TIPS FOR MONITORING YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE  - Practice using the monitor with your health care provider to make sure you are taking your blood pressure correctly.  - Your arm should be supported, with your upper arm at heart level and feet on the floor (back supported, legs uncrossed).  - It is best to measure your blood pressure after you rest for at least 5 minutes.  - DO NOT take your blood pressure when you are under stress, have had caffeine, or used a tobacco product in the last 30 minutes, or have recently exercised.)

ADAM_0001041_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Crying - excessive (0 to 6 months) (Also called: Excessive crying (infants 0 to 6 months))
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003023.htm
Answer: Summary : Infants normally cry about 1 to 3 hours a day. It is perfectly normal for an infant to cry when hungry, thirsty, tired, lonely, or in pain. It is also normal for a baby to have a fussy period in the evening.  But, if an infant cries too often, it may be a sign of something that needs treatment.

Causes : Infants may cry because of any of the following:  - Boredom or loneliness  - Colic  - Discomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or feeling cold  - Hunger or thirst  - Illness  - Infection (a likely cause if the crying is accompanied by irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, or fever. You should call your baby's health care provider)  - Medicines  - Normal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep  - Pain  - Teething

Home Care : Home care depends on the causes. Follow your provider's advice.   If the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.  If crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.  Take your baby's temperature to check for fever. Check your baby head-to-toe for any injuries. Pay particular attention to the fingers, toes, and genitalia. It is not uncommon for a hair to get wrapped around part of your baby, such as a toe, creating pain.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Call the provider if:  - A baby's excessive crying remains unexplained and does not go away in 1 day, despite attempts at home treatment  - The baby has other symptoms, such as fever, along with the excessive crying

What to Expect at Your Office Visit : The provider will examine your baby and ask about the child's medical history and symptoms. Questions may include:  - Is the child teething?  - Is the child bored, lonely, hungry, thirsty?  - Does the child seem to have a lot of gas?  - What other symptoms does the child have? Such as, difficulty waking up, fever, irritability, poor appetite, or vomiting?    The provider will check the infant's growth and development. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the baby has a bacterial infection.)

ADAM_0001562_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Feeding patterns and diet - children 6 months to 2 years
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000713.htm
Answer: Summary : An age-appropriate diet:  - Gives your child proper nutrition  - Is right for your child's state of development  - Can help prevent childhood obesity

Recommendations : 6 to 8 MONTHS  At this age, your baby will probably eat about 4 to 6 times per day, but will eat more at each feeding than the first 6 months.  - If you feed formula, your baby will eat about 6 to 8 ounces per feeding, but should not have more than 32 ounces in 24 hours.  - You can start to introduce solid foods at age 6 months. Most of your baby's calories should still come from breast milk or formula.  - Breast milk is not a good source of iron. So after 6 months, your baby will start to need more iron in their diet. Start solid feedings with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula. Mix it with enough milk so that the texture is very thin. Start by offering the cereal 2 times a day, in just a few spoonfuls.  - You can make the mixture thicker as your baby learns to control it in her mouth.  - You can also introduce iron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables. Try green peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, pears, bananas, and peaches.  - Some dietitians recommend introducing a few vegetables before fruits. The sweetness of fruit may make some vegetables less appealing.  - The amount your child eats will vary between 2 tablespoons and 2 cups of fruits and vegetables per day. How much your child eats depends on their size and how well they eat fruits and vegetables.    There are several ways you can tell that your baby is ready to eat solid foods:  - Your baby's birth weight has doubled.  - Your baby can control their head and neck movements.  - Your baby can sit up with some support.  - Your baby can show you they are full by turning their head away or by not opening their mouth.  - Your baby begins showing interest in food when others are eating.    You should also know:  - Never give honey to your baby. It may contain bacteria that can cause botulism, a rare but serious illness.  - DO NOT give your baby cow's milk until they are 1 year old. Babies under age 1 have a difficult time digesting cow's milk.  - Never put your child to bed with a bottle. This can cause tooth decay. If your baby wants to suck, give them a pacifier.  - Use a small spoon when feeding your baby.  - It is fine to start to give your baby water between feedings.  - DO NOT give your baby cereal in a bottle unless your pediatrician or dietitian recommends it, for example, for reflux.  - Only offer your child new foods when they are hungry.  - Introduce new foods one at a time, waiting 2 to 3 days between. That way you can watch for allergic reactions. Signs of an allergy include diarrhea, rash, or vomiting.  - Avoid foods with added salt or sugar.  - Feed your baby directly from the jar only if you use the entire jar contents. Otherwise, use a dish to prevent food-borne illness.  - Opened containers of baby's food should be covered and stored in a refrigerator for no longer than 2 days.    8 to 12 MONTHS OF AGE  At this age, you can offer finger foods in small amounts. Your baby will probably let you know they are ready to start feeding themselves by grabbing the food or spoon with their hand.  Good finger foods include:  - Soft cooked vegetables  - Washed and peeled fruits  - Graham crackers  - Melba toast  - Noodles    You can also introduce teething foods, such as:  - Toast strips  - Unsalted crackers and bagels  - Teething biscuits    Continue to offer your baby breast milk or formula 3 to 4 times per day at this age.  You should also know:  - Avoid foods that may cause choking, such as apple chunks or slices, grapes, berries, raisins, dry flake cereals, hot dogs, sausages, peanut butter, popcorn, nuts, seeds, round candies, and raw vegetables.  - You can give your child egg yolks 3 to 4 times per week. Some babies are sensitive to egg whites. So DO NOT offer them until after age 1.  - You can offer small amounts of cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt, but no cow's milk.  - By age 1, most children are off the bottle. If your child still uses a bottle, it should contain water only.    1 YEARof AGE  - At this age, you may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula.  - Most mothers in the U.S. wean their babies by this age. But it is also fine to continue to nurse if you and your baby want to.  - DO NOT give your child low-fat milk (2%, 1%, or skim) until after age 2. Your baby needs the extra calories from fat to grow and develop.  - At this age, your baby will get most of their nutrition from proteins, fruits and vegetables, breads and grains, and dairy. You can make sure your baby gets all the vitamins and minerals they need by offering a variety of foods.  - Your child will start to crawl and walk and be much more active. They will eat smaller amounts at a time, but will eat more often (4 to 6 times a day). Having snacks on hand is a good idea.  - At this age, their growing slows. They will not double in size like they did when they were an infant.    You should also know:  - If your child dislikes a new food, try giving it again later. Often it takes several tries for children to take to new foods.  - DO NOT give your child sweets or sweetened beverages. They can spoil their appetite and cause tooth decay.  - Avoid salt, strong spices, and caffeine products, including soft drinks, coffee, tea, and chocolate.  - If your baby is fussy, they may need attention, rather than food.    2 YEARS of AGE  - After your child turns 2, your child's diet should be moderately low in fat. A high-fat diet can lead to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems later in life.  - Your child should eat a variety of foods from each of the food groups: breads and grains, proteins, fruits and vegetables, and dairy.  - If your water is not fluoridated, it is a good idea to use toothpaste or mouthwash with fluoride added.    All children need plenty of calcium to support their growing bones. But not all kids get enough. Good sources of calcium include:  - Low-fat or nonfat milk, yogurt, and cheese  - Cooked greens  - Canned salmon (with bones)    If your child's diet is balanced and healthy, they should not need a vitamin supplement. Some kids are picky eaters, but usually they still get all the nutrients they need. If you are concerned, ask your health care provider whether your child needs a children's multivitamin.

When to Call Your Child's Health Care Provider : Call the provider if you are concerned your child:  - Is not eating enough  - Is eating too much  - Is gaining too much or too little weight  - Has an allergic reaction to food)

ADAM_0003989_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Toxicology screen (Also called: Barbiturates - screen; Benzodiazepines - screen; Amphetamines - screen; Analgesics - screen; Antidepressants - screen; Narcotics - screen; Phenothiazines - screen; Drug abuse screen; Blood alcohol test)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003578.htm
Answer: Summary : A toxicology screen refers to various tests that determine the type and approximate amount of legal and illegal drugs a person has taken.

How the Test is Performed : Toxicology screening is most often done using a blood or urine sample. However, it may be done soon after the person swallowed the medication, using stomach contents taken through gastric lavage (stomach pumping) or after vomiting.

How to Prepare for the Test : No special preparation is needed. If you are able, tell your health care provider what drugs (including over-the-counter medications) you have taken, including when you took them and how much you consumed.  This test is sometimes part of an investigation for drug use or abuse. Special consents, handling and labeling of specimens, or other procedures may be required.

How the Test will Feel : Blood test:  When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.  Urine test:   A urine test involves normal urination. There is no discomfort.

Why the Test is Performed : This test is often done in emergency medical situations. It can be used to evaluate possible accidental or intentional overdose or poisoning. It may help determine the cause of acute drug toxicity, monitor drug dependency, and determine the presence of substances in the body for medical or legal purposes.  Additional reasons the test may be performed:  - Alcoholism  - Alcohol withdrawal state  - Altered mental state  - Analgesic nephropathy (kidney poisoning)  - Complicated alcohol abstinence (delirium tremens)  - Delirium  - Dementia  - Drug abuse monitoring  - Fetal alcohol syndrome  - Intentional overdose  - Seizures  - Stroke caused by cocaine use  - Suspected sexual assault  - Unconsciousness    If the test is used as a drug screen, it must be done within a certain amount of time after the drug was taken, or while forms of the drug can still be detected in the body. Examples are below:  - Alcohol: 3 to 10 hours  - Amphetamines: 24 to 48 hours  - Barbiturates: up to 6 weeks  - Benzodiazepines: up to 6 weeks with high level use  - Cocaine: 2 to 4 days; up to 10 to 22 days with heavy use  - Codeine: 1 to 2 days  - Heroin: 1 to 2 days  - Hydromorphone: 1 to 2 days  - Methadone: 2 to 3 days  - Morphine: 1 to 2 days  - Phencyclidine (PCP): 1 to 8 days  - Propoxyphene: 6 to 48 hours  - Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC): 6 to 11 weeks with heavy use

Normal Results : Normal value ranges for over-the-counter or prescription medications may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.  A negative value usually means that alcohol, prescription medications that have not been prescribed, and illegal drugs have not been detected.  A blood toxicology screen can determine the presence and level (amount) of a drug in your body.  Urine sample results are usually reported as positive (substance is found) or negative (no substance is found).

What Abnormal Results Mean : Elevated levels of alcohol or prescription drugs can be a sign of intentional or accidental intoxication or overdose.  The presence of illegal drugs or drugs not prescribed for the person indicates illicit drug use.

Risks : Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.  Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling light-headed  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)

Considerations : Substances that may be detected on a toxicology screen include:  - Alcohol (ethanol) -- ""drinking"" alcohol  - Amphetamines  - Antidepressants  - Barbiturates and hypnotics  - Benzodiazepines  - Cocaine  - Flunitrazepam (Rohypnol)  - Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB)  - Marijuana  - Narcotics  - Non-narcotic pain medicines, including acetaminophen and anti-inflammatory drugs  - Phencyclidine (PCP)  - Phenothiazines (antipsychotic or tranquilizing medicines)  - Prescription medicines, any type)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/liverfunctiontests.html
Answer: Summary : Your liver helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. Liver function tests are blood tests that check to see how well your liver is working. They check for liver damage, and can help diagnose liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. You may have liver function tests as part of a regular checkup. Or you may have them if you have symptoms of liver disease. Doctors also use the tests to monitor some liver diseases, treatments, and possible side effects of medicines.    Liver function tests measure certain proteins, enzymes, and substances, including:       - Albumin, a protein that the liver makes    - Total protein (TP)    - Enzymes that are found in the liver, including alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)    - Bilirubin, a yellow substance that is part of bile. It is formed when your red blood cells break down. Too much bilirubin in the blood can cause jaundice. There is also a urine test for bilirubin.    - Prothrombin time, which measures how long it takes for your blood to clot. Prothrombin is made by the liver.)

ADAM_0000179_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Am I in labor? (Also called: False labor; Braxton Hicks contractions; Prodromal labor; Latent labor; Pregnancy - labor)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000508.htm
Answer: Summary : If you've never given birth before, you may think you'll just know when the time comes. In reality, it isn't always easy to know when you're going into labor. The steps leading up to labor can drag on for days.  Keep in mind that your due date is just a general idea of when your labor may start. Normal term labor can start any time between 3 weeks before and 2 weeks after this date.

False labor (Braxton Hicks contractions) : Most pregnant women feel mild contractions before true labor begins. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions, which:  - Are typically short  - Are not painful  - Do not come at regular intervals  - Are not accompanied by bleeding, leaking fluid, or decreased fetal movement    This stage is called ""prodromal"" or ""latent"" labor.

Other signs that labor is near : Lightening: This happens when your baby's head ""drops"" down into your pelvis.   - Your belly will look lower. It will be easier for you to breathe because the baby is not putting pressure on your lungs.  - You may need to urinate more often because the baby is pressing on your bladder.  - For first-time mothers, lightening often happens a few weeks before birth. For women who have had babies before, it may not happen until labor has begun.    Bloody show: If you have bloody or brownish discharge from your vagina, it may mean your cervix has begun to dilate. The mucous plug that sealed your cervix for the last 9 months may be visible. This is a good sign. But active labor may still be days away.   Your baby moves less: If you feel less movement, call your doctor or midwife, as sometimes decreased movement can mean that the baby is in trouble.   Your water breaks: When the amniotic sac (bag of fluid around the baby) breaks, you will feel fluid leak from your vagina. It may come out in a trickle or a gush.   - For most women, contractions come within 24 hours after the bag of water breaks.  - Even if contractions don't begin, let your doctor or midwife know as soon as you think your water has broken.    Diarrhea: Some women have the urge to go to the bathroom often to empty their bowels. If this happens and your stools are looser than normal, you may be going into labor.   Nesting: There's no science behind the theory, but plenty of women feel the sudden urge to ""nest"" right before labor starts. If you feel the need to vacuum the entire house at 3 a.m., or finish your work in the baby's nursery, you may be getting ready for labor.

True labor : In real labor, your contractions will:   - Come regularly and get closer together  - Last from 30 to 70 seconds, and will get longer  - Not stop, no matter what you do  - Radiate (reach) into your lower back and upper belly  - Get stronger or become more intense as time goes on  - Make you unable to talk to other people or laugh at a joke

When to call the doctor or midwife : Call your doctor or midwife right away if you have:   - Leaking amniotic fluid  - Decreased fetal movement  - Any vaginal bleeding other than light spotting  - Regular, painful contractions every 5 to 10 minutes for 60 minutes   Call for any other reason if you are unsure what to do.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000639.htm
Answer: Summary : Experts say that breastfeeding your baby is good for you and your baby. If you breastfeed for any length of time, no matter how short it is, you and your baby will benefit from breastfeeding.  Learn about breastfeeding your baby and decide if breastfeeding is for you. Know that breastfeeding takes time and practice. Get help from your family, nurses, lactation consultants, or support groups to succeed at breastfeeding.

Breastfeeding Is Good for Your Baby : Breast milk is the natural food source for infants younger than 1 year. Breast milk:  - Has the right amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fat  - Provides the digestive proteins, minerals, vitamins, and hormones infants need  - Has antibodies that help keep your baby from getting sick

Your Breastfed Baby Is Less Likely to Get Sick : Your baby will have fewer:  - Allergies  - Ear infections  - Gas, diarrhea, and constipation  - Skin diseases (such as eczema)  - Stomach or intestinal infections  - Wheezing problems  - Respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis   Your breastfed baby may have a lower risk for developing:  - Diabetes  - Obesity or weight problems  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)  - Tooth decay

Breastfeeding Is Good for You Too : You will:  - Form a unique bond between yourself and your baby  - Find it easier to lose weight  - Delay starting your menstrual periods  - Lower your risk for diseases, such as breast and certain ovarian cancers, osteoporosis, heart disease, and obesity

Breastfeeding Can Save You Time and Money : You can:  - Save about $1,000 per year when you do not buy formula  - Avoid bottle cleaning  - Avoid having to prepare formula (breast milk is always available at the right temperature)

Get Help if Your Baby or You Have Special Needs : Know that most babies, even premature babies, can breastfeed. Talk to a lactation consultant for help with breastfeeding.  Some babies may have trouble breastfeeding because of:  - Birth defects of the mouth (cleft lip or cleft palate)  - Problems with sucking  - Digestive problems  - Premature birth  - Small size  - Weak physical condition    You may have trouble breastfeeding if you have:  - Breast cancer or other cancer  - Breast infection or breast abscess  - Poor milk supply (uncommon)  - Previous surgery or radiation treatment    Breastfeeding is not recommended for mothers who have:  - Active herpes sores on the breast  - Active, untreated tuberculosis  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or AIDS  - Inflammation of the kidney  - Serious illnesses (such as heart disease or cancer)  - Severe malnutrition

ADAM_0000632_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Calcium - ionized (Also called: Free calcium; Ionized calcium)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003486.htm
Answer: Summary : Ionized calcium is calcium in your blood that is not attached to proteins. It is also called free calcium.  All cells need calcium in order to work. Calcium helps build strong bones and teeth. It is important for heart function. It also helps with muscle contraction, nerve signaling, and blood clotting.  This article discusses the test used to measure the amount of ionized calcium in blood.

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.

How to Prepare for the Test : You should not eat or drink for at least 6 hours before the test.   Many medicines can interfere with blood test results.  - Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.  - DO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.

Why the Test is Performed : Your provider may order this test if you have signs of kidney or parathyroid disease. The test may also be done to monitor progress and treatment of these diseases.  Most of the time, blood tests measure your total calcium level. This looks at both ionized calcium and calcium attached to proteins. You may need to have a separate ionized calcium test if you have factors that increase or decrease total calcium levels. These may include abnormal blood levels of albumin or immunoglobulins.

Normal Results : - Children: 4.8 to 5.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)  - Adults: 4.8 to 5.6 mg/dL    Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.  The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.

ADAM_0001263_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Do-not-resuscitate order ? (Also called: No code; End-of-life; Do not resuscitate; Do not resuscitate order; DNR; DNR order)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000473.htm
Answer: A do-not-resuscitate order, or DNR order, is a medical order written by a doctor. It instructs health care providers not to do cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if a patient's breathing stops or if the patient's heart stops beating.  A DNR order allows you to choose whether or not you want CPR before an emergency occurs. It is specific about CPR. It does not provide instructions for other treatments, such as pain medicine, other medicines, or nutrition.  The doctor writes the order only after talking about it with the patient (if possible), the proxy, or the patient's family.)

ADAM_0001624_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Food additives (Also called: Additives in food; Artificial flavors and color)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002435.htm
Answer: Summary : Food additives are substances that become part of a food product when they are added during the processing or making of that food.   ""Direct"" food additives are often added during processing to:   - Add nutrients  - Help process or prepare the food  - Keep the product fresh  - Make the food more appealing   Direct food additives may be man-made or natural.  Natural food additives include:   - Herbs or spices to add flavor to foods  - Vinegar for pickling foods  - Salt, to preserve meats   ""Indirect"" food additives are substances that may be found in food during or after it is processed. They were not used or placed in the food on purpose. These additives are present in small amounts in the final product.

Function : Food additives serve five main functions.  Give the food a smooth and consistent texture:  - Emulsifiers prevent liquid products from separating.  - Stabilizers and thickeners provide an even texture.  - Anticaking agents allow substances to flow freely.    Improve or preserve the nutrient value:  - Many foods and drinks are fortified and enriched to provide vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Examples of commonly fortified foods are flour, cereal, margarine, and milk. This helps to make up for vitamins or minerals that may be low or lacking in a person's diet.  - All products that contain added nutrients must be labeled.    Maintain the wholesomeness of foods:  - Bacteria and other germs can cause foodborne illnesses. Preservatives reduce the spoilage that these germs can cause.  - Certain preservatives help preserve the flavor in baked goods by preventing the fats and oils from going bad.  - Preservatives also keep fresh fruits from turning brown when they are exposed to the air.    Control the acid-base balance of foods and provide leavening:  - Certain additives help change the acid-base balance of foods to get a certain flavor or color.  - Leavening agents that release acids when they are heated react with baking soda to help biscuits, cakes, and other baked goods rise.    Provide color and enhance flavor:  - Certain colors improve the appearance of foods.  - Many spices, as well as natural and man-made flavors, bring out the taste of food.

Side Effects : Most concerns about food additives have to do with man-made ingredients that are added to foods. Some of these are:  - Antibiotics given to food-producing animals, such as chickens and cows  - Antioxidants in oily or fatty foods  - Artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame, saccharine, and sodium cyclamate  - Benzoic acid in fruit juices  - Lecithin, gelatins, corn starch, waxes, gums, and propylene glycol in food stabilizers and emulsifiers  - Many different dyes and coloring substances  - Monosodium glutamate (MSG)  - Nitrates and nitrites in hot dogs and other processed meat products  - Sulfites in beer, wine, and packaged vegetables    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a list of food additives that are thought to be safe. Many have not been tested, but most scientists consider them to be safe. These substances are put on the ""generally recognized as safe (GRAS)"" list. This list contains about 700 items.   Congress defines safe as ""reasonable certainty that no harm will result from use"" of an additive. Examples of items on this list are: guar gum, sugar, salt, and vinegar. The list is reviewed regularly.  Some substances that are found to be harmful to people or animals may still be allowed, but only at the level of 1/100th of the amount that is considered harmful. For their own protection, people with any allergies or food intolerances should always check the ingredient list on the label. Reactions to any additive can be mild or severe.  It is still important to gather information about the safety of food additives. Tell the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) about any reactions you have to food or food additives. Information about reporting a reaction is available at www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofFoods/CFSAN/ContactCFSAN/default.htm.

Recommendations : The FDA and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) supervise and regulate the use of additives in food products sold in the United States. However, people who have special diets or intolerances should be careful when choosing products in the grocery store.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001956.htm
Answer: Summary : Your health care provider may give you a prescription in different ways, including:   - Writing a paper prescription that you take to a local pharmacy  - Calling or e-mailing a pharmacy to order the medicine  - Sending your prescription to the pharmacy by way of a computer that is linked to the provider's electronic medical record (EMR)    You also need to find out if your health plan will pay for the medicine your provider prescribed.   - Certain types or brands of medicine may not be covered.  - Many health plans require you to pay the pharmacy a portion of the cost of the prescription price. This called a co-pay.    Once you get a prescription from your provider, you may buy the medicine in different ways.   LOCAL PHARMACIES   The most common place for filling a prescription is at a local pharmacy. Some pharmacies are located inside of a grocery or large ""chain"" store.   It is best to fill all prescriptions with the same pharmacy. That way, the pharmacy has a record of all the medicines you are taking. This helps prevent drug interactions.   Your health plan may require you to use certain pharmacies. This means they may not pay for your prescription if you do not use one of these pharmacies. To find a pharmacy that takes your health plan:  - Call the phone number on the back of your insurance card.  - Call the pharmacy you want to use to see if they have a contract with your insurance plan.    To help the pharmacist fill the prescription:   - Make sure all of the information is filled in clearly.  - Bring your insurance card the first time you fill the prescription.  - When calling the pharmacy for a refill, make sure to give your name, the prescription number, and the name of the medicine.    MAIL-ORDER PHARMACIES   Some people and insurance companies choose to use mail-order pharmacies.   - The prescription is sent to the mail-order pharmacy or phoned in by the provider.  - Your medicine may cost less when you order it by mail. However, it may take a week or more for the medicine to get to you.  - Mail order is best used for long-term medicines you use for chronic problems.  - Buy short-term medicines and drugs that need to be stored at certain temperatures at a local pharmacy.    INTERNET (ONLINE) PHARMACIES   Internet pharmacies can be used for long-term medicines and medical supplies.   - The website should have clear directions for filling or transferring your prescription.  - Make sure that the website has clearly-stated privacy policies and other procedures.  - AVOID any website that claims a doctor can prescribe the medicine without seeing you.)

ADAM_0004222_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (Also called: Gastrectomy - sleeve; Gastrectomy - greater curvature; Gastrectomy - parietal; Gastric reduction; Vertical gastroplasty)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007435.htm
Answer: Summary : Vertical sleeve gastrectomy is surgery to help with weight loss. The surgeon removes a large portion of your stomach.  The new, smaller stomach is about the size of a banana. It limits the amount of food you can eat by making you feel full after eating small amounts of food.

Description : You will receive general anesthesia before this surgery. This is medicine that keeps you asleep and pain-free.  The surgery is usually done using a tiny camera that is placed in your belly. This type of surgery is called laparoscopy. The camera is called a laparoscope. It allows your surgeon to see inside your belly.  In this surgery:  - Your surgeon makes 2 to 5 small cuts (incisions) in your belly.  - The scope and instruments needed to perform the surgery are inserted through these cuts.  - The camera is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view inside your belly while doing the operation.  - Your surgeon removes most of your stomach.  - The remaining portions of your stomach are joined together using surgical staples. This creates a long vertical tube or banana-shaped stomach.  - The surgery does not involve cutting or changing the sphincter muscles that allow food to enter or leave the stomach.  - The scope and other tools are removed. The cuts are stitched closed.   The surgery takes 60 to 90 minutes.  Weight-loss surgery may increase your risk of gallstones. Your surgeon may recommend having a cholecystectomy. This is surgery to remove the gallbladder. It may be done before the weight-loss surgery or at the same time.

Why the Procedure is Performed : Weight-loss surgery may be an option if you are very obese and have not been able to lose weight through diet and exercise.  Vertical sleeve gastrectomy is not a quick fix for obesity. It will greatly change your lifestyle. After this surgery, you must eat healthy foods, control portion sizes of what you eat, and exercise. If you do not follow these measures, you may have complications from the surgery and poor weight loss.  This procedure may be recommended if you have:  - A body mass index (BMI) of 40 or more. Someone with a BMI of 40 or more is at least 100 pounds over their recommended weight. A normal BMI is between 18.5 and 25.  - A BMI of 35 or more and a serious medical condition that might improve with weight loss. Some of these conditions are obstructive sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.    Vertical sleeve gastrectomy has most often been done on people who are too heavy to safely have other types of weight-loss surgery. Some people may eventually need a second weight-loss surgery.  This procedure cannot be reversed once it has been done.

Risks : Risks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:  - Allergic reactions to medicines  - Breathing problems  - Bleeding, blood clots, infection   Risks for vertical sleeve gastrectomy are:  - Gastritis (inflamed stomach lining), heartburn, or stomach ulcers  - Injury to your stomach, intestines, or other organs during surgery  - Leaking from the line where parts of the stomach have been stapled together  - Poor nutrition, although much less than with gastric bypass surgery  - Scarring inside your belly that could lead to a blockage in your bowel in the future  - Vomiting from eating more than your stomach pouch can hold

Before the Procedure : Your surgeon will ask you to have tests and visits with your other health care providers before you have this surgery. Some of these are:  - A complete physical exam  - Blood tests, ultrasound of your gallbladder, and other tests to make sure you are healthy enough to have surgery  - Visits with your doctor to make sure other medical problems you may have, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart or lung problems, are under control  - Nutritional counseling  - Classes to help you learn what happens during the surgery, what you should expect afterward, and what risks or problems may occur afterward  - You may want to visit with a counselor to make sure you are emotionally ready for this surgery. You must be able to make major changes in your lifestyle after surgery.    If you smoke, you should stop several weeks before surgery and not start smoking again after surgery. Smoking slows recovery and increases the risk of problems. Ask your provider for help quitting.  Tell your provider:  - If you are or might be pregnant  - What medicines, vitamins, herbs, and other supplements you are taking, even ones you bought without a prescription    During the week before your surgery:  - You may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), vitamin E, warfarin (Coumadin), and others.  - Ask your doctor which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery.    On the day of your surgery:  - Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.  - Take the drugs your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Arrive at the hospital on time.

After the Procedure : You can probably go home 2 days after your surgery. You should be able to drink clear liquids on the day after surgery, and then go on a pureed diet by the time you go home.  When you go home, you will probably be given pain pills or liquids and a drug called a proton pump inhibitor.  When you eat after having this surgery, the small pouch will fill quickly. You will feel full after eating a very small amount of food.  The surgeon, nurse, or dietitian will recommend a diet for you. Meals should be small to avoid stretching the remaining stomach.

Outlook (Prognosis) : The final weight loss may not be as large as with gastric bypass. This may be enough for many people. Talk with your surgeon about which procedure is best for you.  The weight will usually come off more slowly than with gastric bypass. You should keep losing weight for up to 2 to 3 years.  Losing enough weight after surgery can improve many medical conditions you might also have. Conditions that may improve are asthma, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, high blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnea, high cholesterol, and gastroesophageal disease (GERD).  Weighing less should also make it much easier for you to move around and do your everyday activities.  This surgery alone is not a solution to losing weight. It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work. To lose weight and avoid complications from the procedure, you will need to follow the exercise and eating guidelines that your surgeon and dietitian give you.)

ADAM_0000634_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Calcium and bones (Also called: Bone strength and calcium)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002062.htm
Answer: Summary : The mineral calcium helps your muscles, nerves, and cells work normally.  Your body also needs calcium (as well as phosphorus) to make healthy bones. Bones are the main storage site of calcium in the body.  Your body cannot make calcium. The body only gets the calcium it needs through the food you eat, or from supplements. If you do not get enough calcium in your diet, or if your body does not absorb enough calcium, your bones can get weak or will not grow properly.  Bone density refers to how much calcium and other minerals are present in a section of your bone. Bone density is highest between ages 25 and 35. It goes down as you get older. This can result in brittle, fragile bones that can break easily, even without a fall or other injury.  As you age, your body still needs calcium to keep your bones dense and strong. Most experts recommend at least 1,200 milligrams of calcium and 800 to 1,000 international units of vitamin D a day. Your doctor may recommend a supplement to give you the calcium and vitamin D you need.  Some groups recommend much higher doses of vitamin D, but many experts feel that high doses of vitamin D are not safe for everyone. Be sure to discuss with your health care provider whether supplements are a good choice for you.   Follow a diet that provides the proper amount of calcium, vitamin D, and protein. These nutrientswill not completely stop bone loss, but they will help ensure that your body has the materials it needs to build bones.   High-calcium foods include:  - Milk  - Cheese  - Ice cream  - Leafy green vegetables, such as spinach and collard greens  - Salmon  - Sardines (with the bones)  - Tofu  - Yogurt)

ADAM_0000635_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Calcium blood test (Also called: Ca+2; Serum calcium; Ca++; Hyperparathyroidism - calcium level; Osteoporosis - calcium level; Hypercalcemia - calcium level; Hypocalcemia - calcium level)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003477.htm
Answer: Summary : The calcium blood test measures the level of calcium in the blood.  This article discusses the test to measure the total amount of calcium in your blood. About half of the calcium in the blood is attached to proteins, mainly albumin.  A separate test that measures calcium that is not attached to proteins in your blood is sometimes performed. Such calcium is called free or ionized calcium.  Calcium can also be measured in the urine.

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.

How to Prepare for the Test : Your health care provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking certain medicines that can affect the test. These medicines may include:  - Calcium salts (may be found in nutritional supplements or antacids)  - Lithium  - Thiazide diuretics (water pills)  - Thyroxine  - Vitamin D    Drinking too much milk (2 or more quarts a day or a large amount of other dairy products) or taking too much vitamin D as a dietary supplement can also increase blood calcium levels.

How the Test will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.

Why the Test is Performed : All cells need calcium in order to work. Calcium helps build strong bones and teeth. It is important for heart function, and helps with muscle contraction, nerve signaling, and blood clotting.  Your doctor may order this test if you have signs or symptoms of:   - Certain bone diseases  - Certain cancers, such as multiple myeloma, a cancer of the breast, lung, neck, and kidney  - Chronic kidney disease  - Chronic liver disease  - Disorders of the parathyroid glands (hormone made by these glands controls calcium and vitamin D levels in the blood)  - Disorders that affect how your intestines absorb nutrients  - Overactive thyroid gland or taking too much thyroid hormone medicine  - Abnormal vitamin D level    Your doctor may also order this test if you have been on bed rest for a long time.

Normal Results : Normal values range from 8.5 to 10.2 mg/dL.  Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : A higher than normal level may be due to a number of health conditions. Common causes include:  - Being on bed rest for a long time.  - Consuming too much calcium or vitamin D.  - Hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid glands make too much of their hormone; often associated with a low vitamin D level).  - Infections that cause granulomas such as tuberculosis and certain fungal and mycobacterial infections.  - Multiple myeloma, T cell lymphoma and certain other cancers.  - Metastatic bone tumor (bone cancer that has spread).  - Overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or too much thyroid hormone replacement medicine.  - Paget disease. Abnormal bone destruction and regrowth, causing deformity of the affected bones.  - Sarcoidosis. Lymph nodes, lungs, liver, eyes, skin, or other tissues become swollen or inflamed.  - Tumors producing a parathyroid hormone-like substance.  - Use of certain medicines such as lithium, tamoxifen, and thiazides.    A lower than normal levels may be due to:  - Disorders that affect absorption of nutrients from the intestines  - Hypoparathyroidism (parathyroid glands do not make enough of their hormone)  - Kidney failure  - Low blood level of albumin  - Liver disease  - Magnesium deficiency  - Pancreatitis  - Vitamin D deficiency

Risks : There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.  Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling lightheaded  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  - Multiple punctures to locate veins)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002605.htm
Answer: Summary : Calcium carbonate is commonly found in antacids (for heartburn) and some dietary supplements. Calcium carbonate overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of a product containing this substance. This can be by accident or on purpose.  This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual overdose. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poisonous Ingredient : Calcium carbonate can be dangerous in large amounts.

Where Found : Some products that contain calcium carbonate are certain:  - Antacids (Tums, Chooz)  - Mineral supplements  - Hand lotions  - Vitamin and mineral supplements   Other products may also contain calcium carbonate.

Symptoms : Symptoms of a calcium carbonate overdose include:  - Abdominal pain  - Bone pain  - Coma  - Confusion  - Constipation  - Depression  - Diarrhea  - Headache  - Irregular heartbeat  - Muscle twitching  - Nausea  - Vomiting

Home Care : Seek medical help right away. DO NOT make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to.

Before Calling Emergency : Have this information ready:   - Person's age, weight, and condition  - The name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)  - When it was swallowed  - The amount swallowed

Poison Control : Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room : Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.  The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Blood tests may be done. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive:  - Activated charcoal  - Blood and urine tests  - Breathing support  - Chest x-ray  - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)  - Intravenous fluids (through a vein)  - Laxative  - Medicine to treat symptoms  - Tube through the mouth into the stomach to empty the stomach (gastric lavage)

Outlook (Prognosis) : Calcium carbonate is not very poisonous. Recovery is quite likely. But, long-term overuse is more serious than a single overdose, because it can cause kidney damage. Few people die from an antacid overdose.   Keep all medicines in child-proof bottles and out of the reach of children.)

ADAM_0002495_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Magnesium in diet (Also called: Diet - magnesium)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002423.htm
Answer: Summary : Magnesium is an essential mineral for human nutrition.

Function : Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps to maintain normal nerve and muscle function, supports a healthy immune system, keeps the heart beat steady, and helps bones remain strong. It also helps regulate blood glucose levels and aid in the production of energy and protein. There is ongoing research into the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes. However, taking magnesium supplements is not currently recommended. Diets high in protein, calcium, or vitamin D will increase the need for magnesium.

Food Sources : Most dietary magnesium comes from vegetables, such as dark green, leafy vegetables. Other foods that are good sources of magnesium:  - Fruits or vegetables (such as bananas, dried apricots, and avocados)  - Nuts (such as almonds and cashews)  - Peas and beans (legumes), seeds  - Soy products (such as soy flour and tofu)  - Whole grains (such as brown rice and millet)  - Milk

Side Effects : Side effects from increased magnesium intake are not common. The body generally removes excess amounts. Magnesium excess almost always occurs only when a person is taking in too much of the mineral in supplement form.  Although you may not get enough magnesium from your diet, it is rare to be truly deficient in magnesium. The symptoms of such a deficiency include:  - Hyperexcitability  - Muscle weakness  - Sleepiness    Deficiency of magnesium can occur in people who abuse alcohol or in those who absorb less magnesium due to:  - Burns  - Certain medications  - Low blood levels of calcium  - Problems absorbing nutrients from the intestinal tract (malabsorption)  - Surgery    Symptoms due to a lack of magnesium have three categories.  Early symptoms:  - Anorexia  - Apathy  - Confusion  - Fatigue  - Insomnia  - Irritability  - Muscle twitching  - Poor memory  - Reduced ability to learn    Moderate deficiency symptoms:  - Heart (cardiovascular) changes  - Rapid heartbeat    Severe deficiency:  - Continued muscle contraction  - Delirium  - Numbness  - Seeing or hearing things that aren't there (hallucinations)  - Tingling

Recommendations : These are the recommended daily requirements of magnesium:  Infants:  - Birth to 6 months: 30 mg/day*  - 6 months to 1 year: 75 mg/day*    *AI or Adequate Intake  Children:   - 1 to 3 years old: 80 milligrams  - 4 to 8 years old: 130 milligrams  - 9 to 13 years old: 240 milligrams  - 14 to 18 years old (boys): 410 milligrams  - 14 to 18 years old (girls): 360 milligrams    Adults:   - Adult females: 310 to 320 milligrams  - Pregnancy: 350 to 400 milligrams  - Breastfeeding women: 310 to 360 milligrams  - Adult males: 400 to 420 milligrams)

MPlusHealthTopics_0000139_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Calcium
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/calcium.html
Answer: Summary : You have more calcium in your body than any other mineral. Calcium has many important jobs. The body stores more than 99 percent of its calcium in the bones and teeth to help make and keep them strong. The rest is throughout the body in blood, muscle and the fluid between cells. Your body needs calcium to help muscles and blood vessels contract and expand, to secrete hormones and enzymes and to send messages through the nervous system.     It is important to get plenty of calcium in the foods you eat. Foods rich in calcium include       - Dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt    - Leafy, green vegetables    - Fish with soft bones that you eat, such as canned sardines and salmon    - Calcium-enriched foods such as breakfast cereals, fruit juices, soy and rice drinks, and tofu. Check the product labels.       The exact amount of calcium you need depends on your age and other factors. Growing children and teenagers need more calcium than young adults. Older women need plenty of calcium to prevent osteoporosis. People who do not eat enough high-calcium foods should take a calcium supplement.

ADAM_0000637_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Calcium carbonate with magnesium overdose (Also called: Rolaids overdose; Antacids overdose)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002539.htm
Answer: Summary : The combination of calcium carbonate and magnesium is commonly found in antacids. These medicines provide heartburn relief.  Calcium carbonate with magnesium overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of medicine that contains these ingredients. The overdose may be by accident or on purpose.  This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual overdose. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poisonous Ingredient : Calcium carbonate and magnesium

Where Found : Calcium carbonate with magnesium is found in many (but not all) antacids, including the following brands:  - Maalox  - Mylanta  - Rolaids  - Tums    Other antacids may also contain calcium carbonate and magnesium.

Symptoms : Symptoms of an overdose of calcium carbonate and magnesium include:  - Bone pain (from chronic overuse)  - Constipation  - Decreased reflexes  - Diarrhea  - Dry mouth  - Irregular heartbeat  - Poor balance  - Shallow, rapid breathing  - Skin flushing  - Stupor (lack of alertness)

Home Care : Seek medical help right away. DO NOT make a person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to.

Before Calling Emergency : Have this information ready:  - Person's age, weight, and condition  - Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)  - Time it was swallowed  - Amount swallowed  - If the medicine was prescribed for the person

Poison Control : Your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room : Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.

ADAM_0000640_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Calcium in diet (Also called: Diet - calcium)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002412.htm
Answer: Summary : Calcium is the most plentiful mineral found in the human body. The teeth and bones contain the most calcium. Nerve cells, body tissues, blood, and other body fluids contain the rest of the calcium.

Function : Calcium is one of the most important minerals for the human body. It helps form and maintain healthy teeth and bones. A proper level of calcium in the body over a lifetime can help prevent osteoporosis.  Calcium helps your body with:  - Building strong bones and teeth  - Clotting blood  - Sending and receiving nerve signals  - Squeezing and relaxing muscles  - Releasing hormones and other chemicals  - Keeping a normal heartbeat

Food Sources : CALCIUM AND DAIRY PRODUCTS  Many foods contain calcium, but dairy products are the best source. Milk and dairy products such as yogurt, cheeses, and buttermilk contain a form of calcium that your body can easily absorb.  Whole milk (4% fat) is recommended for children ages 1 to 2. Adults and children over age 2 should drink low-fat (2% or 1%) milk or skim milk and other dairy products. Removing the fat will not lower the amount of calcium in a dairy product.  - Yogurt, most cheeses, and buttermilk are excellent sources of calcium and come in low-fat or fat-free versions.  - Milk is also a good source of phosphorus and magnesium, which help the body absorb and use calcium.  - Vitamin D is needed to helpyour body use calcium. Milk is fortified with vitamin D for this reason.    OTHER SOURCES OF CALCIUM  Other sources of calcium that can help meet your body's calcium needs include:  - Green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, collards, kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, and bok choy or Chinese cabbage  - Salmon and sardines canned with their soft bones  - Almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, tahini, and dried beans  - Blackstrap molasses    Calcium is often added to food products. These include foods such asorange juice, soy milk, tofu, ready-to-eat cereals, and breads. These are a very good source of calcium for people who do not eat a lot of dairy products.  Ways to make sure you get enough calcium in your diet:  - Cook foods in a small amount of water for the shortest possible time to keep more calcium in the foods you eat. (This means steaming or sauting to cook instead ofboiling foods.)  - Be careful aboutthe other foods you eat with calcium-rich foods. Certain fibers, such as wheat bran, and foods with oxalic acid (spinach and rhubarb) can bind with calcium and prevent it from being absorbed. This is why leafy greens are not considered an adequatesource of calcium by themselves, because your body is unable to utilize much of the calcium they contain. People on a vegan diet need to be sure to also include soy products and fortified products in order to get enough calcium.   DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS  Calcium is also found in many multivitamin-mineral supplements. The amount varies, depending on the supplement. Dietary supplements may contain only calcium, or calcium with other nutrients such as vitamin D. Check the label on the Supplement Facts panel of the package to determine the amount of calcium in the supplement. Calcium absorption is best when taken in amounts of no more than 500 mg at a time.  Two commonly available forms of calcium dietary supplements include calcium citrate and calcium carbonate.  - Calcium citrate is the more expensive form of the supplement. It is taken up well by the body on a full or empty stomach.  - Calcium carbonate is less expensive. It is absorbed better by the body if taken with food. Calcium carbonate is found in over-the-counter antacid products such as Rolaids or Tums. Each chew or pill usually provides 200 to 400 mg of calcium. Check the label for the exact amount.    Other types of calcium in supplements and foods include calcium lactate, calcium gluconate, and calcium phosphate.

Side Effects : Increased calcium for a limited period of time does not normally cause side effects. However, receiving higher amounts of calcium over a long period of time raises the risk of kidney stones in some people.  Those who do not receive enough calcium over a long period of time can develop osteoporosis (thinning of bone tissue and loss of bone density over time). Other disorders are also possible.  People with lactose intolerance have trouble digesting lactose, the sugar in milk. Over-the-counter products are available that make it easier to digest lactose. You can also buy lactose-free milk at most grocery stores. Most people who do not suffer from severe lactose-intolerance are still able to digest hard cheeses and yogurt.  Tell your health care provider about any dietary supplements and medicines you take. Your provider can tell you if those dietary supplements might interact or interfere with your prescription or over-the-counter medicines. In addition, some medicines might interfere with how your body absorbs calcium.

Recommendations : The preferred source of calcium is calcium-rich foods such as dairy products. Some people will need to take a calcium supplement. How much calcium you need depends on your age and gender. Other factors, such as pregnancy and illnesses, are also important.  Recommendations for calcium, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the Institute of Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include:  - Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97 to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.  - Adequate Intake (AI): This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA. It is set at a level that is thought to ensure enough nutrition.   The preferred source of calcium is calcium-rich foods such as dairy products. Some people will need to take a calcium supplementif they do not get enough calcium from the foods they eat.  Infants (AI)  - 0to 6 months: 200 milligrams per day (mg/day)  - 7to 12 months: 260 mg/day    Children and Adolescents (RDA)  - Age 1to 3: 700 mg/day  - Age 4to 8: 1,000 mg/day  - Age 9 to 18: 1,300 mg/day    Adults (RDA)  - Age 19to 50: 1,000 mg/day  - Age 50to 70: Men - 1,000 mg/day; Women - 1,200 mg/day  - Over age 71:1,200 mg/day    Pregnancy and breast-feeding (RDA)  - Age 14to 18: 1,300 mg/day  - Age 19to 50: 1,000 mg/day    Up to 2,500to 3,000 mg a day of calcium from dietary sources and supplements appears to be safe for children and adolescents, and 2,000to 2,500 mg a day appears to be safe for adults.  The following list can help you determine how much calcium you are getting from food:  - 8-ounce glass of milk = 300 mg of calcium  - 1.5 ounces of Swiss cheese = 300 mg of calcium  - 6 ounces of yogurt = 300 mg of calcium  - 3 ounces of sardines with bones = 200 mg of calcium  -  cup of cooked turnip greens = 100 mg of calcium  -  cup of almonds = 100 mg of calcium  - 1 medium orange = 50 mg calcium  - 1 medium baked sweet potato = 50 mg calcium   Vitamin D is needed to help the body absorb calcium. When choosing a calcium supplement, look foronethat also contains vitamin D.)

ADAM_0000643_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Calcium, vitamin D, and your bones (Also called: Osteoporosis - calcium; Osteoporosis - low bone density)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000490.htm
Answer: Summary : Your body needs calcium to keep your bones dense and strong. Low bone density can cause your bones to become brittle and fragile. These weak bones can break easily, even without an obvious injury.  Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Eat foods that provide the right amounts of calcium, vitamin D, and protein. This kind of diet will give your body the building blocks it needs to make and maintain strong bones.

How Much Calcium and Vitamin D Do I Need? : Amounts of calcium are given in milligrams (mg), and vitamin D is given in international units (IU).   All adults under age 50 should have:  - 1,000 mg of calcium daily  - 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D daily    Adults age 51 and older should have:   - Women: 1,200 mg of calcium daily  - Men: 1,000 mg of calcium daily  - Men and women: 800 to 1,000 IU of vitamin D daily

Calcium and Dairy Products : Milk and dairy products are the best sources of calcium. They contain a form of calcium that your body can absorb easily. Choose yogurts, cheeses, and buttermilk.  Adults should choose fat-free (skim) milk or low-fat (2% or 1%) milk, and other lower fat dairy products. Removing some of the fat does not lower the amount of calcium in a dairy product.  - Yogurt, most cheeses, and buttermilk come in fat-free or low-fat versions.  - Vitamin D helps your body use calcium, which is why vitamin D is often added to milk.    If you eat very few or no dairy products, you can find calcium in other foods. It is often added to orange juice, soy milk, tofu, ready-to-eat cereals, and breads. Check the labels on these foods for added calcium.

Other Sources of Calcium : Green leafy vegetables, such as broccoli, collards, kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, and bak choy (Chinese cabbage), also spelled ""bok"" choy, are good sources of calcium.  Other good food sources of calcium are:   - Salmon and sardines that are canned with their bones (you can eat these soft bones)  - Almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, tahini (sesame paste), and dried beans  - Blackstrap molasses    Other tips to make sure your body can use the calcium in your diet:  - Cook high-calcium vegetables in a small amount of water for the shortest possible time. They willretain more calcium this way.  - Be careful about what you eat with calcium-rich foods. Certain fibers, such as wheat brain and foods with oxalic acid (spinach and rhubarb), can prevent your body from absorbing calcium.    Your doctor may recommend a calcium or vitamin D supplement for the calcium and vitamin D you need.

ADAM_0002495_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Magnesium in diet (Also called: Diet - magnesium)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002423.htm
Answer: Summary : Magnesium is an essential mineral for human nutrition.

Function : Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps to maintain normal nerve and muscle function, supports a healthy immune system, keeps the heart beat steady, and helps bones remain strong. It also helps regulate blood glucose levels and aid in the production of energy and protein. There is ongoing research into the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes. However, taking magnesium supplements is not currently recommended. Diets high in protein, calcium, or vitamin D will increase the need for magnesium.

Food Sources : Most dietary magnesium comes from vegetables, such as dark green, leafy vegetables. Other foods that are good sources of magnesium:  - Fruits or vegetables (such as bananas, dried apricots, and avocados)  - Nuts (such as almonds and cashews)  - Peas and beans (legumes), seeds  - Soy products (such as soy flour and tofu)  - Whole grains (such as brown rice and millet)  - Milk

Side Effects : Side effects from increased magnesium intake are not common. The body generally removes excess amounts. Magnesium excess almost always occurs only when a person is taking in too much of the mineral in supplement form.  Although you may not get enough magnesium from your diet, it is rare to be truly deficient in magnesium. The symptoms of such a deficiency include:  - Hyperexcitability  - Muscle weakness  - Sleepiness    Deficiency of magnesium can occur in people who abuse alcohol or in those who absorb less magnesium due to:  - Burns  - Certain medications  - Low blood levels of calcium  - Problems absorbing nutrients from the intestinal tract (malabsorption)  - Surgery    Symptoms due to a lack of magnesium have three categories.  Early symptoms:  - Anorexia  - Apathy  - Confusion  - Fatigue  - Insomnia  - Irritability  - Muscle twitching  - Poor memory  - Reduced ability to learn    Moderate deficiency symptoms:  - Heart (cardiovascular) changes  - Rapid heartbeat    Severe deficiency:  - Continued muscle contraction  - Delirium  - Numbness  - Seeing or hearing things that aren't there (hallucinations)  - Tingling

Recommendations : These are the recommended daily requirements of magnesium:  Infants:  - Birth to 6 months: 30 mg/day*  - 6 months to 1 year: 75 mg/day*    *AI or Adequate Intake  Children:   - 1 to 3 years old: 80 milligrams  - 4 to 8 years old: 130 milligrams  - 9 to 13 years old: 240 milligrams  - 14 to 18 years old (boys): 410 milligrams  - 14 to 18 years old (girls): 360 milligrams    Adults:   - Adult females: 310 to 320 milligrams  - Pregnancy: 350 to 400 milligrams  - Breastfeeding women: 310 to 360 milligrams  - Adult males: 400 to 420 milligrams)

ADAM_0000642_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Calcium supplements
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007477.htm
Answer: Summary : WHO SHOULD TAKE CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS?  Calcium is an important mineral for the human body. It helps build and protect your teeth and bones. Getting enough calcium over your lifetime can help prevent osteoporosis.  Most people get enough calcium in their normal diet. Dairy foods and leafy green vegetables have high levels of calcium. Older women and men may need extra calcium to prevent their bones from getting thin (osteoporosis).  Your health care provider will tell you if you need to take extra calcium.  TYPES OF CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS   Forms of calcium include:  - Calcium carbonate: Over-the-counter (OTC) antacid products, such as Tums and Rolaids, contain calcium carbonate. These sources of calcium do not cost much. Each pill or chew provides 200 to 400 mg of calcium.  - Calcium citrate: This is a more expensive form of calcium. It is absorbed well on an empty or full stomach. People with low levels of stomach acid (a condition that is more common in people over age 50) absorb calcium citrate better than calcium carbonate.  - Other forms, such as calcium gluconate, calcium lactate, calcium phosphate: Most have less calcium than the carbonate and citrate forms.    When choosing a calcium supplement:  - Look the word ""purified"" or the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) symbol on the label.  - Avoid products made from unrefined oyster shell, bone meal, or dolomite that do not have the USP symbol. They may have high levels of lead or other toxic metals.    HOW TO TAKE EXTRA CALCIUM   Increase the dose of your calcium supplement slowly. Start with 500 mg a day for a week, and then add more over time.  Try to spread the extra calcium you take over the day. DO NOT take more than 500 mg at a time. Taking calcium throughout the day will:  - Allow more calcium to be absorbed  - Cut down on side effects such as gas, bloating, and constipation    The total amount of calcium adults need every day from food and calcium supplements:  - 19 to 50 years: 1,000 mg/day  - 51 to 70 years: Men - 1,000 mg/day; Women - 1,200 mg/day  - 71 years and over: 1,200 mg/day    The body needs vitamin D to help absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from sunlight exposure to your skin and from your diet. Ask your provider whether you need to take a vitamin D supplement.  SIDE EFFECTS AND SAFETY  DO NOT take more than the recommended amount of calcium without your provider's ok.  Try the following steps if you have side effects from taking extra calcium:   - Drink more fluids.  - Eat high-fiber foods  - Switch to another form of calcium if the diet changes do not help.    Always tell your provider and pharmacist if you are taking extra calcium. Calcium supplements may change the way your body absorbs some medicines. These include certain types of antibiotics and iron pills.  Be aware of the following:  - Taking extra calcium over a long period of time raises the risk of kidney stones in some people.  - Too much calcium can prevent the body from absorbing iron, zinc, magnesium, and phosphorus.  - Antacids have other ingredients such as sodium, aluminum, and sugar. Ask your provider if antacids are ok for you use as a calcium supplement.)

Answer: Summary : Laboratory tests check a sample of your blood, urine, or body tissues. A technician or your doctor analyzes the test samples to see if your results fall within the normal range. The tests use a range because what is normal differs from person to person. Many factors affect test results. These include       -  Your sex, age and race    -  What you eat and drink    -  Medicines you take    -  How well you followed pre-test instructions       Your doctor may also compare your results to results from previous tests. Laboratory tests are often part of a routine checkup to look for changes in your health. They also help doctors diagnose medical conditions, plan or evaluate treatments, and monitor diseases.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001573.htm
Answer: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is present at birth. It is often caused by a defect in the gene that produces type 1 collagen, an important building block of bone. There are many defects that can affect this gene. The severity of OI depends on the specific gene defect.  If you have 1 copy of the gene, you will have the disease. Most cases of OI are inherited from a parent. However, some cases are the result of new genetic mutations.  A person with OI has a 50% chance of passing on the gene and the disease to his or her children.)

Answer: All people with OI have weak bones, and fractures are more likely. People with OI are most often below average height (short stature). However, the severity of the disease varies greatly.  The classic symptoms include:  - Blue tint to the whites of their eyes (blue sclera)  - Multiple bone fractures  - Early hearing loss (deafness)   Because type I collagen is also found in ligaments, people with OI often have loose joints (hypermobility) and flat feet. Some types of OI also lead to the development of poor teeth.  Symptoms of more severe forms of OI may include:  - Bowed legs and arms  - Kyphosis  - Scoliosis (S-curve spine))

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001573.htm
Answer: There is not yet a cure for this disease. However, specific therapies can reduce the pain and complications from OI.  Drugs that can increase the strength and density of bone are used in people with OI. They have been shown to reduce bone pain and fracture rate (especially in the bones of the spine). They are called bisphosphonates.  Low impact exercises, such as swimming, keep muscles strong and help maintain strong bones. People with OI can benefit from these exercises and should be encouraged to do them.  In more severe cases, surgery to place metal rods into the long bones of the legs may be considered. This procedure can strengthen the bone and reduce the risk for fracture. Bracing can also be helpful for some people.  Surgery may be needed to correct any deformities. This treatment is important because deformities (such as bowed legs or a spinal problem) can interfere with a person's ability to move or walk.  Even with treatment, fractures will occur. Most fractures heal quickly. Time in a cast should be limited, because bone loss may occur when you do not use a part of your body for a period of time.  Many children with OI develop body image problems as they enter their teenage years. A social worker or psychologist can help them adapt to life with OI.)

If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of pelvic girdle bone morphology - Absent ossification of calvaria - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Beaded ribs - Blue sclerae - Broad long bones - Congestive heart failure - Convex nasal ridge - Crumpled long bones - Disproportionate short-limb short stature - Large fontanelles - Multiple prenatal fractures - Nonimmune hydrops fetalis - Platyspondyly - Premature birth - Pulmonary insufficiency - Recurrent fractures - Respiratory insufficiency - Small for gestational age - Thin skin - Tibial bowing - Wormian bones - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/gnathodiaphyseal-dysplasia
Answer: Gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia is a disorder that affects the bones. People with this condition have reduced bone mineral density (osteopenia), which causes the bones to be unusually fragile. As a result, affected individuals typically experience multiple bone fractures in childhood, often from mild trauma or with no apparent cause.  While most bone tissue is less dense than normal in gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia, the outer layer (cortex) of the shafts of the long bones in the arms and legs is abnormally hard and thick (diaphyseal sclerosis). Bowing of the long bones also occurs in this disorder.  Jaw problems are common in gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia; the prefix ""gnatho-"" in the condition name refers to the jaw. Affected individuals may develop bone infections (osteomyelitis) in the jaw, which can lead to pain, swelling, discharge of pus from the gums, loose teeth, and slow healing after teeth are lost or extracted. Areas of the jawbone may lose the protective coverage of the gums, which can result in deterioration of the exposed bone (osteonecrosis of the jaw). Also, normal bone in areas of the jaw may be replaced by fibrous tissue and a hard material called cementum, which normally surrounds the roots of teeth and anchors them in the jaw. These areas of abnormal bone, called cementoosseous lesions, may be present at birth or develop later in life.  When gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia was first described, it was thought to be a variation of another bone disorder called osteogenesis imperfecta, which is also characterized by frequent bone fractures. However, gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia is now generally considered to be a separate condition. Unlike in osteogenesis imperfecta, the fractures in gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia heal normally without causing deformity or loss of height.)

GHR_0000757_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) osteogenesis imperfecta ? (Also called: Brittle bone disease; Fragilitas ossium; OI; Vrolik disease)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/osteogenesis-imperfecta
Answer: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of genetic disorders that mainly affect the bones. The term ""osteogenesis imperfecta"" means imperfect bone formation. People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from mild trauma or with no apparent cause. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can occur even before birth. Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime.  There are at least eight recognized forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, designated type I through type VIII. The types can be distinguished by their signs and symptoms, although their characteristic features overlap. Type I is the mildest form of osteogenesis imperfecta and type II is the most severe; other types of this condition have signs and symptoms that fall somewhere between these two extremes. Increasingly, genetic factors are used to define the different forms of osteogenesis imperfecta.  The milder forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, including type I, are characterized by bone fractures during childhood and adolescence that often result from minor trauma. Fractures occur less frequently in adulthood. People with mild forms of the condition typically have a blue or grey tint to the part of the eye that is usually white (the sclera), and may develop hearing loss in adulthood. Affected individuals are usually of normal or near normal height.  Other types of osteogenesis imperfecta are more severe, causing frequent bone fractures that may begin before birth and result from little or no trauma. Additional features of these conditions can include blue sclerae, short stature, hearing loss, respiratory problems, and a disorder of tooth development called dentinogenesis imperfecta. The most severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, particularly type II, can include an abnormally small, fragile rib cage and underdeveloped lungs. Infants with these abnormalities have life-threatening problems with breathing and often die shortly after birth.)

GHR_0000757_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to osteogenesis imperfecta ? (Also called: Brittle bone disease; Fragilitas ossium; OI; Vrolik disease)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/osteogenesis-imperfecta
Answer: Mutations in the COL1A1, COL1A2, CRTAP, and P3H1 genes cause osteogenesis imperfecta.  Mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are responsible for more than 90 percent of all cases of osteogenesis imperfecta. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are used to assemble type I collagen. This type of collagen is the most abundant protein in bone, skin, and other connective tissues that provide structure and strength to the body.  Most of the mutations that cause osteogenesis imperfecta type I occur in the COL1A1 gene. These genetic changes reduce the amount of type I collagen produced in the body, which causes bones to be brittle and to fracture easily. The mutations responsible for most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta types II, III, and IV occur in either the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene. These mutations typically alter the structure of type I collagen molecules. A defect in the structure of type I collagen weakens connective tissues, particularly bone, resulting in the characteristic features of osteogenesis imperfecta.  Mutations in the CRTAP and P3H1 genes are responsible for rare, often severe cases of osteogenesis imperfecta. Cases caused by CRTAP mutations are usually classified as type VII; when P3H1 mutations underlie the condition, it is classified as type VIII. The proteins produced from these genes work together to process collagen into its mature form. Mutations in either gene disrupt the normal folding, assembly, and secretion of collagen molecules. These defects weaken connective tissues, leading to severe bone abnormalities and problems with growth.  In cases of osteogenesis imperfecta without identified mutations in one of the genes described above, the cause of the disorder is unknown. These cases include osteogenesis imperfecta types V and VI. Researchers are working to identify additional genes that may be responsible for these conditions.)

GHR_0000757_Sec4.txt,"Question: Is osteogenesis imperfecta inherited ? (Also called: Brittle bone disease; Fragilitas ossium; OI; Vrolik disease)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/osteogenesis-imperfecta
Answer: Most cases of osteogenesis imperfecta have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Many people with type I or type IV osteogenesis imperfecta inherit a mutation from a parent who has the disorder. Most infants with more severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (such as type II and type III) have no history of the condition in their family. In these infants, the condition is caused by new (sporadic) mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene.  Less commonly, osteogenesis imperfecta has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder typically are not affected, but each carry one copy of the altered gene. Some cases of osteogenesis imperfecta type III are autosomal recessive; these cases usually result from mutations in genes other than COL1A1 and COL1A2. When osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the CRTAP or P3H1 gene, the condition also has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/osteoporosis-pseudoglioma-syndrome
Answer: Osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome is a rare condition characterized by severe thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) and eye abnormalities that lead to vision loss. In people with this condition, osteoporosis is usually recognized in early childhood. It is caused by a shortage of minerals, such as calcium, in bones (decreased bone mineral density), which makes the bones brittle and prone to fracture. Affected individuals often have multiple bone fractures, including in the bones that form the spine (vertebrae). Multiple fractures can cause collapse of the affected vertebrae (compressed vertebrae), abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), short stature, and limb deformities. Decreased bone mineral density can also cause softening or thinning of the skull (craniotabes).  Most affected individuals have impaired vision at birth or by early infancy and are blind by young adulthood. Vision problems are usually caused by one of several eye conditions, grouped together as pseudoglioma, that affect the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), although other eye conditions have been identified in affected individuals. Pseudogliomas are so named because, on examination, the conditions resemble an eye tumor known as a retinal glioma.  Rarely, people with osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome have additional signs or symptoms such as mild intellectual disability, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), abnormally flexible joints, or seizures.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/osteogenesisimperfecta.html
Answer: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder in which bones break easily. Sometimes the bones break for no known reason. OI can also cause weak muscles, brittle teeth, a curved spine, and hearing loss. OI is caused by one of several genes that aren't working properly. When these genes don't work, it affects how you make collagen, a protein that helps make bones strong.     OI can range from mild to severe, and symptoms vary from person to person. A person may have just a few or as many as several hundred fractures in a lifetime.    No single test can identify OI. Your doctor uses your medical and family history, physical exam, and imaging and lab tests to diagnose it. Your doctor may also test your collagen (from skin) or genes (from blood). There is no cure, but you can manage symptoms. Treatments include exercise, pain medicine, physical therapy, wheelchairs, braces, and surgery.

Answer: OI is most often suspected in children whose bones break with very little force. A physical exam may show that the whites of their eyes have a blue tint.  A definitive diagnosis may be made using a skin punch biopsy. Family members may be given a DNA blood test.  If there is a family history of OI, chorionic villus sampling  may be done during pregnancy to determine if the baby has the condition. However, because so many different mutations can cause OI, some forms cannot be diagnosed with a genetic test.

Answer: Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears.   Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are two types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells.  Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results.  Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all.  A woman's sexual habits and patterns can increase her risk of developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include:   - Having sex at an early age  - Having multiple sexual partners  - Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities    Other risk factors for cervical cancer include:  - Not getting the HPV vaccine  - Being economically disadvantaged  - Having a mother who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage  - Having a weakened immune system)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000436.htm
Answer: Cervical spondylosis is caused by aging andchronic wear on the cervical spine. This includes the disks or cushions between the neck vertebrae and the joints between the bones of the cervical spine. There may be abnormal growths or spurs on the bones of the spine (vertebrae).  Over time, these changes can press down on (compress) one or more of the nerve roots. In advanced cases, the spinal cord becomes involved. This can affect not just the arms, but the legs as well.  Everyday wear and tear may start these changes. People who are very active at work or in sports may be more likely to have them.  The major risk factor is aging. By age 60, mostpeople show signs of cervical spondylosis on x-ray. Other factors that can make someone more likely to develop spondylosis are:  - Being overweight and not exercising  - Having a job that requires heavy lifting or a lot of bending and twisting  - Past neck injury (often several years before)  - Past spine surgery  - Ruptured or slipped disk  - Severe arthritis  - Small fractures to the spine from osteoporosis)

ADAM_0001319_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Ear infection - acute ? (Also called: Otitis media - acute; Infection - inner ear; Middle ear infection - acute)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000638.htm
Answer: The eustachian tube runs from the middle of each ear to the back of the throat. Normally, this tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If this tube gets blocked, fluid can build up. This can lead to infection.  - Ear infections are common in infants and children because the eustachian tubes are easily clogged.  - Ear infections can also occur in adults, although they are less common than in children.     Anything that causes the eustachian tubes to become swollen or blocked makes more fluid build up in the middle ear behind the eardrum. Some causes are:  - Allergies  - Colds and sinus infections  - Excess mucus and saliva produced during teething  - Infected or overgrown adenoids (lymph tissue in the upper part of the throat)  - Tobacco smoke    Ear infections are also more likely in children who spend a lot of time drinking from a sippy cup or bottle while lying on their back. Getting water in the ears will not cause an acute ear infection, unless the eardrum has a hole in it.  Acute ear infections most often occur in the winter. You cannot catch an ear infection from someone else. But a cold that spreads among children may cause some of them to get ear infections.  Risk factors for acute ear infections include:  - Attending day care (especially centers with more than 6 children)  - Changes in altitude or climate  - Cold climate  - Exposure to smoke  - Family history of ear infections  - Not being breastfed  - Pacifier use  - Recent ear infection  - Recent illness of any type (because illness lowers the body's resistance to infection))

Answer: In infants, often the main sign of an ear infection is acting irritable or crying that cannot be soothed. Many infants and children with an acute ear infection have a fever or trouble sleeping. Tugging on the ear is not always a sign that the child has an ear infection.  Symptoms of an acute ear infection in older children or adults include:  - Ear pain or earache  - Fullness in the ear  - Feeling of general illness  - Vomiting  - Diarrhea  - Hearing loss in the affected ear    The ear infection may start shortly after a cold. Sudden drainage of yellow or green fluid from the ear may mean the eardrum has ruptured.  All acute ear infections involve fluid behind the eardrum. At home, you can use an electronic ear monitor to check for this fluid. You can buy this device at a drugstore. You still need to see a health care provider to confirm an ear infection.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000619.htm
Answer: The Eustachian tube runs from the middle of each ear to the back of the throat. This tube drains fluid made in the middle ear. If the Eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. When this happens, infection can occur. A chronic ear infection develops when fluid or an infection behind the eardrum does not go away.    A chronic ear infection may be caused by:  - An acute ear infection that does not completely go away  - Repeated ear infections     ""Suppurative chronic otitis"" is a phrase health care providers use to describe an eardrum that keeps rupturing, draining, or swelling in the middle ear or mastoid area and does not go away.

This helps reduce or stop bleeding during surgery or after an injury. It is a safe procedure.  A small probe with an electric current running through it is used to burn or destroy the tissue. A grounding pad is placed on the body (usually the thigh) before the surgery to protect the person from the harmful effects of the electricity.)

Answer: AUDIOLOGIST  An audiologist is trained to test a baby's hearing and provide follow-up care to those with hearing problems. Most newborns have their hearing screened before leaving the hospital. Your health care providers will determine which hearing test is best. Hearing tests may also be done after leaving the hospital.  CARDIOLOGIST  A cardiologist is a doctor that has special training in the diagnosis and treatment of heart and blood vessel disease. Pediatric cardiologists are trained to deal with newborn heart problems. The cardiologist may examine the baby, order tests, and read test results. Tests to diagnose heart conditions may include:  - X-ray  - Electrocardiogram (EKG)  - Echocardiogram  - Cardiac catheterization    If the structure of the heart is not normal due to a birth defect, a cardiologist might work with a cardiovascular surgeon to perform surgery on the heart.  CARDIOVASCULAR SURGEON  A cardiovascular (heart) surgeon is a doctor who has special training in doing surgery to correct or treat defects of the heart. Pediatric cardiovascular surgeons are trained to deal with newborn heart problems.   Sometimes, surgery can correct a heart problem.

ADAM_0003589_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Sinusitis ? (Also called: Acute sinusitis; Sinus infection; Sinusitis - acute; Sinusitis - chronic; Rhinosinusitis)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000647.htm
Answer: The sinuses are air-filled spaces in the skull. They are located behind the forehead, nasal bones, cheeks, and eyes. Healthy sinuses contain no bacteria or other germs. Most of the time, mucus is able to drain out and air is able to flow through the sinuses.   When the sinus openings become blocked or too much mucus builds up, bacteria and other germs can grow more easily.  Sinusitis can occur from one of these conditions:  - Small hairs (cilia) in the sinuses fail to properly to move mucus out. This may be due to some medical conditions.  - Colds and allergies may cause too much mucus to be made or block the opening of the sinuses.  - A deviated nasal septum, nasal bone spur, or nasal polyps may block the opening of the sinuses.     There are two types of sinusitis:  - Acute sinusitis is whensymptoms are present for 4 weeks or less. It is caused by bacteria growing in the sinuses.  - Chronic sinusitis is when swelling and inflammation of the sinuses are present for longer than 3 months.It may be caused by bacteria or a fungus.    The following may increase the risk that an adult or child will develop sinusitis:  - Allergic rhinitis or hay fever  - Cystic fibrosis  - Going to day care  - Diseases that prevent the cilia from working properly  - Changes in altitude (flying or scuba diving)  - Large adenoids  - Smoking  - Weakened immune system from HIV or chemotherapy)

NIDDK_0000016_Sec4.txt,"Question: What causes Anemia of Inflammation and Chronic Disease ?
URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/blood-diseases/anemia-inflammation-chronic-disease/Pages/fact-sheet.aspx
Answer: Anemia of inflammation and chronic disease is caused by red blood cells not functioning normally, so they cannot absorb and use iron efficiently. In addition, the body cannot respond normally to erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone made by the kidneys that stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Over time, this abnormal functioning causes a lower than normal number of red blood cells in the body.
                
Some of the chronic diseases that lead to AI/ACD include infectious and inflammatory diseases, kidney disease, and cancer. Certain treatments for chronic diseases may also impair red blood cell production and contribute to AI/ACD.
                
Infectious and inflammatory diseases. As part of the immune system response that occurs with infectious and inflammatory diseases, cells of the immune system release proteins called cytokines. Cytokines help heal the body and defend it against infection. However, they can also affect normal body functions. In AI/ACD, immune cytokines interfere with the bodys ability to absorb and use iron. Cytokines may also interfere with the production and normal activity of EPO.
                
Infectious diseases that cause AI/ACD include
                
- tuberculosis, an infection in the lungs  - HIV/AIDS, an infection that destroys the immune system  - endocarditis, an infection in the heart  - osteomyelitis, a bone infection
                
Sometimes, acute infectionsthose that develop quickly and may not last longcan also cause AI/ACD.
                
Inflammatory diseases that can lead to AI/ACD include
                
- rheumatoid arthritis, which causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints  - lupus, which causes damage to various body tissues, such as the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain  - diabetes, in which levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar, are above normal  - heart failure, in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs  - inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diseases that cause inflammation and irritation in the intestines
                
IBD, including Crohns disease, can also cause iron deficiency due to poor absorption of iron by the diseased intestine and bleeding from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
                
Kidney disease. People with kidney disease can develop anemia for several different reasons. Diseased kidneys often fail to make enough EPO. In addition, kidney disease results in abnormal absorption and use of iron, which is typical of AI/ACD. Anemia worsens as kidney disease advances. Therefore, most people with kidney failure have anemia. Kidney failure is described as end-stage kidney disease, sometimes called ESRD, when treated with a kidney transplant or blood-filtering treatments called dialysis.
                
People with kidney failure can also develop iron deficiency due to blood loss during hemodialysis, a type of dialysis that uses a special filter called a dialyzer to remove wastes from the blood. Low levels of iron and folic acidanother nutrient required for normal red blood cell productionmay also contribute to anemia in people with kidney disease.
                
Cancer. AI/ACD can occur with certain types of cancer, including Hodgkins disease, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and breast cancer. Like infectious and inflammatory diseases, these types of cancer cause inflammatory cytokines to be released in the body. Anemia can also be made worse by chemotherapy and radiation treatments that damage the bone marrow, and by the cancers invasion of bone marrow.)

Be sure to follow instructions on how long to leave it inside, how often to change it, or how often to clean it.  - Being in a monogamous sexual relationship with someone who is known to be free of any STI. Monogamous means you and your partner do not have sex with any other people. Not having sexual intercourse (abstinence) is the only absolute method of preventing sexually transmitted cervicitis.  - Using by using a condom every time you have sex to lower your risk of getting an STI. Condoms are available for both men and women, but are most commonly worn by the man. A condom must be used properly every time.)

Answer: Many physical and emotional factors can cause infertility. It may be due to problems in the woman, man, or both.  FEMALE INFERTILITY  Female infertility may occur when:  - A fertilized egg or embryo does not survive once it attaches to the lining of the womb (uterus).  - The fertilized egg does not attach to the lining of the uterus.  - The eggs cannot move from the ovaries to the womb.  - The ovaries have problems producing eggs.    Female infertility may be caused by:   - Autoimmune disorders, such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)  - Birth defects that affect the reproductive tract  - Cancer or tumor  - Clotting disorders  - Diabetes  - Drinking too much alcohol  - Exercising too much  - Eating disorders or poor nutrition  - Growths (such as fibroids or polyps) in the uterus and cervix  - Medicines such as chemotherapy drugs  - Hormone imbalances  - Obesity  - Older age  - Ovarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)  - Pelvic infection or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)  - Scarring from sexually transmitted infection, abdominal surgery or endometriosis  - Smoking  - Surgery to prevent pregnancy (tubal ligation) or failure of tubal ligation reversal (reanastomosis)  - Thyroid disease    MALE INFERTILITY  Male infertility may be due to:  - Decreased number of sperm  - Blockage that prevents the sperm from being released  - Defects in the sperm    Male infertility can be caused by:  - Birth defects  - Cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation  - Exposure to high heat for prolonged periods  - Heavy use of alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine  - Hormone imbalance  - Impotence  - Infection  - Medicines such as cimetidine, spironolactone, and nitrofurantoin  - Obesity  - Older age  - Retrograde ejaculation  - Scarring from sexually transmitted infections, injury, or surgery  - Smoking  - Toxins in the environment  - Vasectomy or failure of vasectomy reversal    Healthy couples under age 30 who have sex regularly will have a 25 to 30% per month chance of getting pregnant each month.  A woman is most fertile in her early 20s. The chance a woman can get pregnant drops greatly after age 35 (and especially after age 40). The age when fertility starts to decline varies from woman to woman.  Infertility problems and miscarriage rates increase significantly after 35 year of age. There are now options for early egg retrieval and storage for women in their 20's. This will help ensure a successful pregnancy if childbearing is delayed until after age 35. This is an expensive option, but for women who know they will need to delay childbearing, it may be worth considering.)

MPlusHealthTopics_0000356_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Female Infertility ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/femaleinfertility.html
Answer: Infertility means not being able to get pregnant after at least one year of trying (or 6 months if the woman is over age 35). If a woman keeps having miscarriages, it is also called infertility. Female infertility can result from age, physical problems, hormone problems, and lifestyle or environmental factors.    Most cases of infertility in women result from problems with producing eggs. In premature ovarian failure, the ovaries stop functioning before natural menopause. In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the ovaries may not release an egg regularly or they may not release a healthy egg.    About a third of the time, infertility is because of a problem with the woman. One third of the time, it is a problem with the man. Sometimes no cause can be found.    If you think you might be infertile, see your doctor. There are tests that may tell if you have fertility problems. When it is possible to find the cause, treatments may include medicines, surgery, or assisted reproductive technologies. Happily, many couples treated for infertility are able to have babies.

MPlusHealthTopics_0000514_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Infertility ? (Also called: Sterility)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/infertility.html
Answer: Infertility means not being able to become pregnant after a year of trying. If a woman can get pregnant but keeps having miscarriages or stillbirths, that's also called infertility.    Infertility is fairly common. After one year of having unprotected sex, about 15 percent of couples are unable to get pregnant. About a third of the time, infertility can be traced to the woman. In another third of cases, it is because of the man. The rest of the time, it is because of both partners or no cause can be found.    There are treatments that are specifically for men or for women. Some involve both partners. Drugs, assisted reproductive technology, and surgery are common treatments. Happily, many couples treated for infertility go on to have babies.

ADAM_0000179_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Am I in labor? (Also called: False labor; Braxton Hicks contractions; Prodromal labor; Latent labor; Pregnancy - labor)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000508.htm
Answer: Summary : If you've never given birth before, you may think you'll just know when the time comes. In reality, it isn't always easy to know when you're going into labor. The steps leading up to labor can drag on for days.  Keep in mind that your due date is just a general idea of when your labor may start. Normal term labor can start any time between 3 weeks before and 2 weeks after this date.

False labor (Braxton Hicks contractions) : Most pregnant women feel mild contractions before true labor begins. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions, which:  - Are typically short  - Are not painful  - Do not come at regular intervals  - Are not accompanied by bleeding, leaking fluid, or decreased fetal movement    This stage is called ""prodromal"" or ""latent"" labor.

Other signs that labor is near : Lightening: This happens when your baby's head ""drops"" down into your pelvis.   - Your belly will look lower. It will be easier for you to breathe because the baby is not putting pressure on your lungs.  - You may need to urinate more often because the baby is pressing on your bladder.  - For first-time mothers, lightening often happens a few weeks before birth. For women who have had babies before, it may not happen until labor has begun.    Bloody show: If you have bloody or brownish discharge from your vagina, it may mean your cervix has begun to dilate. The mucous plug that sealed your cervix for the last 9 months may be visible. This is a good sign. But active labor may still be days away.   Your baby moves less: If you feel less movement, call your doctor or midwife, as sometimes decreased movement can mean that the baby is in trouble.   Your water breaks: When the amniotic sac (bag of fluid around the baby) breaks, you will feel fluid leak from your vagina. It may come out in a trickle or a gush.   - For most women, contractions come within 24 hours after the bag of water breaks.  - Even if contractions don't begin, let your doctor or midwife know as soon as you think your water has broken.    Diarrhea: Some women have the urge to go to the bathroom often to empty their bowels. If this happens and your stools are looser than normal, you may be going into labor.   Nesting: There's no science behind the theory, but plenty of women feel the sudden urge to ""nest"" right before labor starts. If you feel the need to vacuum the entire house at 3 a.m., or finish your work in the baby's nursery, you may be getting ready for labor.

True labor : In real labor, your contractions will:   - Come regularly and get closer together  - Last from 30 to 70 seconds, and will get longer  - Not stop, no matter what you do  - Radiate (reach) into your lower back and upper belly  - Get stronger or become more intense as time goes on  - Make you unable to talk to other people or laugh at a joke

When to call the doctor or midwife : Call your doctor or midwife right away if you have:   - Leaking amniotic fluid  - Decreased fetal movement  - Any vaginal bleeding other than light spotting  - Regular, painful contractions every 5 to 10 minutes for 60 minutes   Call for any other reason if you are unsure what to do.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003462.htm
Answer: Summary : The basic metabolic panel is a group of blood tests that provides information about your body's metabolism.

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.

How to Prepare for the Test : You should not eat or drink for 8 hours before the test.

How the Test will Feel : You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.

Why the Test is Performed : This test is done to evaluate:  - Kidney function  - Blood acid/base balance  - Blood sugar levels   In some cases, the test also is used to check blood levels of calcium and a protein called albumin.

Normal Results : The following are normal ranges for the blood chemicals tested:  - BUN: 7 to 20 mg/dL  - CO2 (carbon dioxide): 20 to 29 mmol/L  - Creatinine: 0.8 to 1.2 mg/dL  - Glucose: 64 to 100 mg/dL  - Serum chloride: 101 to 111 mmol/L  - Serum potassium: 3.7 to 5.2 mEq/L  - Serum sodium: 136 to 144 mEq/L    Key to abbreviations:  - L = liter  - dL = deciliter = 0.1 liter  - mg = milligram  - mmol = millimole  - mEq = milliequivalents    Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.  The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results can be due to a variety of different medical conditions, including kidney failure, breathing problems, diabetes or diabetes-related complications, and medication side effects.

ADAM_0001041_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Crying - excessive (0 to 6 months) (Also called: Excessive crying (infants 0 to 6 months))
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003023.htm
Answer: Summary : Infants normally cry about 1 to 3 hours a day. It is perfectly normal for an infant to cry when hungry, thirsty, tired, lonely, or in pain. It is also normal for a baby to have a fussy period in the evening.  But, if an infant cries too often, it may be a sign of something that needs treatment.

Causes : Infants may cry because of any of the following:  - Boredom or loneliness  - Colic  - Discomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or feeling cold  - Hunger or thirst  - Illness  - Infection (a likely cause if the crying is accompanied by irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, or fever. You should call your baby's health care provider)  - Medicines  - Normal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep  - Pain  - Teething

Home Care : Home care depends on the causes. Follow your provider's advice.   If the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.  If crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.  Take your baby's temperature to check for fever. Check your baby head-to-toe for any injuries. Pay particular attention to the fingers, toes, and genitalia. It is not uncommon for a hair to get wrapped around part of your baby, such as a toe, creating pain.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Call the provider if:  - A baby's excessive crying remains unexplained and does not go away in 1 day, despite attempts at home treatment  - The baby has other symptoms, such as fever, along with the excessive crying

What to Expect at Your Office Visit : The provider will examine your baby and ask about the child's medical history and symptoms. Questions may include:  - Is the child teething?  - Is the child bored, lonely, hungry, thirsty?  - Does the child seem to have a lot of gas?  - What other symptoms does the child have? Such as, difficulty waking up, fever, irritability, poor appetite, or vomiting?    The provider will check the infant's growth and development. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the baby has a bacterial infection.)

ADAM_0001087_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Cystometric study (Also called: CMG; Cystometrogram)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003904.htm
Answer: Summary : Cystometric study measures the amount of fluid in the bladder when you first feel the need to urinate, when you are able to sense fullness, and when your bladder is completely full.

How the Test is Performed : Prior to the cystometric study, you may be asked to urinate (void) into a special container that is interfaced with a computer. This type of study is called a uroflow, during which the following will be recorded by the computer:  - The time it takes you to begin urinating  - The size, force, and continuity of your urinary stream  - The amount of urine  - How long it took you to empty your bladder   You will then lie down, and a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is gently placed in your bladder. The catheter measures any urine left in the bladder. A smaller catheter is sometimes placed in your rectum in order to measure abdominal pressure. Measuring electrodes, similar to the sticky pads used for an EKG, are placed near the rectum.  A tube used to monitor bladder pressure (cystometer) is attached to the catheter. Water flows into the bladder at a controlled rate. You will be asked to tell the health care provider when you first feel the need to urinate and when your bladder is completely full.  Often, your doctor may need more information and will order tests to evaluate of your bladder function.This set of tests is often referred to as urodynamics or complete urodynamics. The combination includes three tests:  - Measured voiding without a catheter (uroflow)  - Cystometry (filling phase)  - Voiding or emptying phase test   For complete urodynamic testing, a much smaller catheter is placed in the bladder. You will be able to urinate around it.Because this special catheter has a sensor on the tip, the computer can measure the pressure and volumes as your bladder fills and as you empty it. You may be asked to cough or push so that the health care provider can check for urine leakage. This type of complete testing can reveal a lot of information about your bladder functions.  For even more information, x-rays can be taken during the test. In this case, instead of water, a special fluid that shows up on x-ray is used to fill your bladder.This type of urodynamics is called videourodynamics.

How to Prepare for the Test : No special preparations areneeded for this test.  For infants and children, preparation depends on the child's age,past experiences, and level of trust. For general information regarding how you can prepare your child, see the following topics:  - Preschooler test or procedure preparation (3 to 6 years)  - School age test or procedure preparation (6 to 12 years)  - Adolescent test or procedure preparation (12 to 18 years)

How the Test will Feel : There is some discomfort associated with this test. You may experience:  - Bladder filling  - Flushing  - Nausea  - Pain  - Sweating  - Urgent need to urinate

Why the Test is Performed : The test will help determine the cause of bladder voiding dysfunction.

Normal Results : Normalresults vary and should be discussed with your health care provider.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may be due to:  - Enlarged prostate  - Multiple sclerosis  - Overactive bladder  - Reduced bladder capacity  - Spinal cord injury  - Stroke  - Urinary tract infection

Risks : There is a slight risk of urinary tract infection and blood in the urine.

Considerations : This test should not be done if you have a known urinary tract infection. Existing infection increases the possibility of false test results. The test itself increases the possibility of spreading the infection.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000713.htm
Answer: Summary : An age-appropriate diet:  - Gives your child proper nutrition  - Is right for your child's state of development  - Can help prevent childhood obesity

Recommendations : 6 to 8 MONTHS  At this age, your baby will probably eat about 4 to 6 times per day, but will eat more at each feeding than the first 6 months.  - If you feed formula, your baby will eat about 6 to 8 ounces per feeding, but should not have more than 32 ounces in 24 hours.  - You can start to introduce solid foods at age 6 months. Most of your baby's calories should still come from breast milk or formula.  - Breast milk is not a good source of iron. So after 6 months, your baby will start to need more iron in their diet. Start solid feedings with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula. Mix it with enough milk so that the texture is very thin. Start by offering the cereal 2 times a day, in just a few spoonfuls.  - You can make the mixture thicker as your baby learns to control it in her mouth.  - You can also introduce iron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables. Try green peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, pears, bananas, and peaches.  - Some dietitians recommend introducing a few vegetables before fruits. The sweetness of fruit may make some vegetables less appealing.  - The amount your child eats will vary between 2 tablespoons and 2 cups of fruits and vegetables per day. How much your child eats depends on their size and how well they eat fruits and vegetables.    There are several ways you can tell that your baby is ready to eat solid foods:  - Your baby's birth weight has doubled.  - Your baby can control their head and neck movements.  - Your baby can sit up with some support.  - Your baby can show you they are full by turning their head away or by not opening their mouth.  - Your baby begins showing interest in food when others are eating.    You should also know:  - Never give honey to your baby. It may contain bacteria that can cause botulism, a rare but serious illness.  - DO NOT give your baby cow's milk until they are 1 year old. Babies under age 1 have a difficult time digesting cow's milk.  - Never put your child to bed with a bottle. This can cause tooth decay. If your baby wants to suck, give them a pacifier.  - Use a small spoon when feeding your baby.  - It is fine to start to give your baby water between feedings.  - DO NOT give your baby cereal in a bottle unless your pediatrician or dietitian recommends it, for example, for reflux.  - Only offer your child new foods when they are hungry.  - Introduce new foods one at a time, waiting 2 to 3 days between. That way you can watch for allergic reactions. Signs of an allergy include diarrhea, rash, or vomiting.  - Avoid foods with added salt or sugar.  - Feed your baby directly from the jar only if you use the entire jar contents. Otherwise, use a dish to prevent food-borne illness.  - Opened containers of baby's food should be covered and stored in a refrigerator for no longer than 2 days.    8 to 12 MONTHS OF AGE  At this age, you can offer finger foods in small amounts. Your baby will probably let you know they are ready to start feeding themselves by grabbing the food or spoon with their hand.  Good finger foods include:  - Soft cooked vegetables  - Washed and peeled fruits  - Graham crackers  - Melba toast  - Noodles    You can also introduce teething foods, such as:  - Toast strips  - Unsalted crackers and bagels  - Teething biscuits    Continue to offer your baby breast milk or formula 3 to 4 times per day at this age.  You should also know:  - Avoid foods that may cause choking, such as apple chunks or slices, grapes, berries, raisins, dry flake cereals, hot dogs, sausages, peanut butter, popcorn, nuts, seeds, round candies, and raw vegetables.  - You can give your child egg yolks 3 to 4 times per week. Some babies are sensitive to egg whites. So DO NOT offer them until after age 1.  - You can offer small amounts of cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt, but no cow's milk.  - By age 1, most children are off the bottle. If your child still uses a bottle, it should contain water only.    1 YEARof AGE  - At this age, you may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula.  - Most mothers in the U.S. wean their babies by this age. But it is also fine to continue to nurse if you and your baby want to.  - DO NOT give your child low-fat milk (2%, 1%, or skim) until after age 2. Your baby needs the extra calories from fat to grow and develop.  - At this age, your baby will get most of their nutrition from proteins, fruits and vegetables, breads and grains, and dairy. You can make sure your baby gets all the vitamins and minerals they need by offering a variety of foods.  - Your child will start to crawl and walk and be much more active. They will eat smaller amounts at a time, but will eat more often (4 to 6 times a day). Having snacks on hand is a good idea.  - At this age, their growing slows. They will not double in size like they did when they were an infant.    You should also know:  - If your child dislikes a new food, try giving it again later. Often it takes several tries for children to take to new foods.  - DO NOT give your child sweets or sweetened beverages. They can spoil their appetite and cause tooth decay.  - Avoid salt, strong spices, and caffeine products, including soft drinks, coffee, tea, and chocolate.  - If your baby is fussy, they may need attention, rather than food.    2 YEARS of AGE  - After your child turns 2, your child's diet should be moderately low in fat. A high-fat diet can lead to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems later in life.  - Your child should eat a variety of foods from each of the food groups: breads and grains, proteins, fruits and vegetables, and dairy.  - If your water is not fluoridated, it is a good idea to use toothpaste or mouthwash with fluoride added.    All children need plenty of calcium to support their growing bones. But not all kids get enough. Good sources of calcium include:  - Low-fat or nonfat milk, yogurt, and cheese  - Cooked greens  - Canned salmon (with bones)    If your child's diet is balanced and healthy, they should not need a vitamin supplement. Some kids are picky eaters, but usually they still get all the nutrients they need. If you are concerned, ask your health care provider whether your child needs a children's multivitamin.

When to Call Your Child's Health Care Provider : Call the provider if you are concerned your child:  - Is not eating enough  - Is eating too much  - Is gaining too much or too little weight  - Has an allergic reaction to food)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000877.htm
Answer: Fungi are germs that can live on the dead tissue of the hair, nails, and outer skin layers. Tinea corporis is caused by mold-like fungi called dermatophytes.  Tinea corporis is common in children, but can occur in people of all ages.  Fungi thrive in warm, moist areas. A tinea infection is more likely if you:   - Have wet skin for a long time (such as from sweating)  - Have minor skin and nail injuries  - Do not bathe or wash your hair often  - Have close contact with other people (such as in sports like wrestling)    Tinea corporis can spread easily. You can catch it if you come into direct contact with an area of ringworm on someone's body. You can also get it by touching items that have the fungi on them, such as:  - Clothing  - Combs  - Pool surfaces  - Shower floors and walls    Ringworm can also be spread by pets. (Cats are common carriers.))

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000877.htm
Answer: Keep your skin clean and dry.  Use creams that treat fungal infections.   - Creams that contain miconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, terbenifine, or oxiconazole are often effective in controlling ringworm.  - You can buy some of these creams over-the-counter, or your health care provider may give you a prescription.    To use this medicine:  - Wash and dry the area first.  - Apply the cream, beginning just outside the area of the rash and moving toward the center. Be sure to wash and dry your hands afterward.  - Use the cream twice a day for 7 to 10 days.  - Do not use a bandage over ringworm.    Rarely, you may need to take medicine by mouth if your infection is very bad.   A child with ringworm can return to school once treatment has started.  To prevent the infection from spreading:  - Wash all towels in warm, soapy water and then dry them.  - Use a new towel and washcloth every time you wash.  - Clean sinks, bathtubs, and bathroom floors well after each use.  - Wear clean clothes every day and do not share clothes.    Infected pets should also be treated.)

URL: https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10247/down-syndrome
Answer: What causes Down syndrome? There are 3 possible genetic causes of Down syndrome: Trisomy 21. Most often, Down syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome 21 in all cells of the affected person.  In these cases, the chromosome 21 pair fails to separate during the formation of an egg (or sperm); this is called ""nondisjunction."" When the egg with 2 copies of chromosome 21 unites with a normal sperm with one copy of chromosome 21 to form an embryo, the resulting embryo has 3 copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two. The extra chromosome is then copied in every cell of the baby's body, causing the features of Down syndrome. The cause of nondisjunction is unknown, but research has shown that it happens more often as women age. Nondisjunction is not known to be caused by anything in the environment or anything that parents do (or don't do) before or during pregnancy. Mosaic trisomy 21. In about 1-2% of cases, only some of the cells in a person's body have an extra chromosome 21; this is called ""mosaic trisomy 21"".  In this situation, the fertilized egg may have the right number of chromosomes, but due to a cell division error early in the development of the embryo, some cells ""acquire"" an extra chromosome 21. A person with mosaic trisomy 21 typically has 46 chromosomes in some cells, and 47 chromosomes (with the extra chromosome 21) in others. The features and severity in people with mosaic trisomy 21 may vary widely.  Translocation trisomy 21. About 3-4% of people with Down syndrome have cells that contain 46 chromosomes; however, there is extra chromosome 21 material attached (translocated ) onto another chromosome.  For parents of a child with Down syndrome due to a translocation, there may be an increased chance of Down syndrome in future pregnancies. This is because one of the two parents may be a carrier of a balanced translocation. However, not all parents of people with translocation trisomy 21 have a translocation. Regardless of the type of Down syndrome a person has, all people with Down syndrome have an extra, critical portion of chromosome 21 present in all or some of their cells. This extra genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of Down syndrome.)

Answer: Trisomy 18, also called Edwards syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 18 often have slow growth before birth (intrauterine growth retardation) and a low birth weight. Affected individuals may have heart defects and abnormalities of other organs that develop before birth. Other features of trisomy 18 include a small, abnormally shaped head; a small jaw and mouth; and clenched fists with overlapping fingers. Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many individuals with trisomy 18 die before birth or within their first month. Five to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year, and these children often have severe intellectual disability.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/trisomy-18
Answer: Most cases of trisomy 18 result from having three copies of chromosome 18 in each cell in the body instead of the usual two copies. The extra genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of trisomy 18.  Approximately 5 percent of people with trisomy 18 have an extra copy of chromosome 18 in only some of the body's cells. In these people, the condition is called mosaic trisomy 18. The severity of mosaic trisomy 18 depends on the type and number of cells that have the extra chromosome. The development of individuals with this form of trisomy 18 may range from normal to severely affected.  Very rarely, part of the long (q) arm of chromosome 18 becomes attached (translocated) to another chromosome during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or very early in embryonic development. Affected individuals have two copies of chromosome 18, plus the extra material from chromosome 18 attached to another chromosome. People with this genetic change are said to have partial trisomy 18. If only part of the q arm is present in three copies, the physical signs of partial trisomy 18 may be less severe than those typically seen in trisomy 18. If the entire q arm is present in three copies, individuals may be as severely affected as if they had three full copies of chromosome 18.)

GHR_0000997_Sec4.txt,"Question: Is trisomy 18 inherited ? (Also called: complete trisomy 18 syndrome; Edwards syndrome; trisomy 18 syndrome; trisomy E syndrome)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/trisomy-18
Answer: Most cases of trisomy 18 are not inherited, but occur as random events during the formation of eggs and sperm. An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of chromosome 18. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra chromosome 18 in each of the body's cells.  Mosaic trisomy 18 is also not inherited. It occurs as a random event during cell division early in embryonic development. As a result, some of the body's cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 18, and other cells have three copies of this chromosome.  Partial trisomy 18 can be inherited. An unaffected person can carry a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 18 and another chromosome. This rearrangement is called a balanced translocation because there is no extra material from chromosome 18. Although they do not have signs of trisomy 18, people who carry this type of balanced translocation are at an increased risk of having children with the condition.)

Answer: Many factors can affect blood pressure, including:  - The amount of water and salt you have in your body  - The condition of your kidneys, nervous system, or blood vessels  - Your hormone levels    You are more likely to be told your blood pressure is too high as you get older. This is because your blood vessels become stiffer as you age. When that happens, your blood pressure goes up. High blood pressure increases your chance of having a stroke, heart attack, heart failure, kidney disease, or early death.  You have a higher risk of high blood pressure if you:  - Are African American  - Are obese  - Are often stressed or anxious  - Drink too much alcohol (more than 1 drink per day for women and more than 2 drinks per day for men)  - Eat too much salt  - Have a family history of high blood pressure  - Have diabetes  - Smoke    Most of the time, no cause of high blood pressure is found. This is called essential hypertension.  High blood pressure that is caused by another medical condition or medicine you are taking is called secondary hypertension. Secondary hypertension may be due to:  - Chronic kidney disease  - Disorders of the adrenal gland (such as pheochromocytoma or Cushing syndrome)  - Hyperparathyroidism  - Pregnancy or preeclampsia  - Medicines such as birth control pills, diet pills, some cold medicines, and migraine medicines  - Narrowed artery that supplies blood to the kidney (renal artery stenosis))

NHLBI_0000071_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hbp
Answer: Espaol
                
High blood pressure is a common disease in which blood flows through blood vessels (arteries) at higher than normal pressures.
                
Measuring Blood Pressure
                
Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood. High blood pressure, sometimes called hypertension, happens when this force is too high. Health care workers check blood pressure readings the same way for children, teens, and adults. They use a gauge, stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. With this equipment, they measure:
                
Systolic Pressure: blood pressure when the heart beats while pumping blood
                
Diastolic Pressure: blood pressure when the heart is at rest between beats
                
Health care workers write blood pressure numbers with the systolic number above the diastolic number. For example:
                

                
118/76 mmHg People read ""118 over 76"" millimeters of mercury.
                
Normal Blood Pressure
                
Normal blood pressure for adults is defined as a systolic pressure below 120 mmHg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg. It is normal for blood pressures to change when you sleep, wake up, or are excited or nervous. When you are active, it is normal for your blood pressure to increase. However, once the activity stops, your blood pressure returns to your normal baseline range.
                
Blood pressure normally rises with age and body size. Newborn babies often have very low blood pressure numbers that are considered normal for babies, while older teens have numbers similar to adults.
                
Abnormal Blood Pressure
                
Abnormal increases in blood pressure are defined as having blood pressures higher than 120/80 mmHg. The following table outlines and defines high blood pressure severity levels.
                
Stages of High Blood Pressure in Adults
                
The ranges in the table are blood pressure guides for adults who do not have any short-term serious illnesses. People with diabetes or chronic kidney disease should keep their blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg.
                
Although blood pressure increases seen in prehypertension are less than those used to diagnose high blood pressure, prehypertension can progress to high blood pressure and should be taken seriously. Over time, consistently high blood pressure weakens and damages your blood vessels, which can lead to complications.
                
Types of High Blood Pressure
                
There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure.
                
Primary High Blood Pressure
                
Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages.
                
Secondary High Blood Pressure
                
Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. This type usually resolves after the cause is treated or removed.)

NHLBI_0000071_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes High Blood Pressure ?
URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hbp
Answer: Changes, either fromgenesor the environment, in the bodys normal functions may cause high blood pressure, including changes to kidney fluid and salt balances, therenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,sympathetic nervous systemactivity, and blood vessel structure and function.
                
Biology and High Blood Pressure
                
Researchers continue to study how various changes in normal body functions cause high blood pressure. The key functions affected in high blood pressure include:
                
Kidney fluid and salt balances
                
Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
                
Sympathetic nervous system activity
                
Blood vessel structure and function
                

                
Kidney Fluid and Salt Balances
                
The kidneys normally regulate the bodys salt balance by retaining sodium and water and excreting potassium. Imbalances in this kidney function can expand blood volumes, which can cause high blood pressure.
                

                
Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System
                
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system makes angiotensin and aldosterone hormones. Angiotensin narrows or constricts blood vessels, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Aldosterone controls how the kidneys balance fluid and salt levels. Increased aldosterone levels or activity may change this kidney function, leading to increased blood volumes and high blood pressure.
                

                
Sympathetic Nervous System Activity
                
The sympathetic nervous system has important functions in blood pressure regulation, including heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. Researchers are investigating whether imbalances in this system cause high blood pressure.
                

                
Blood Vessel Structure and Function
                
Changes in the structure and function of small and large arteries may contribute to high blood pressure. The angiotensin pathway and the immune system may stiffen small and large arteries, which can affect blood pressure.
                

                
Genetic Causes of High Blood Pressure
                
Much of the understanding of the body systems involved in high blood pressure has come from genetic studies. High blood pressure often runs in families. Years of research have identified many genes and other mutations associated with high blood pressure, some in the renal salt regulatory and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathways. However, these known genetic factors only account for 2 to 3percent of all cases. Emerging research suggests that certain DNA changes during fetal development also may cause the development of high blood pressure later in life.
                
Environmental Causes of High Blood Pressure
                
Environmental causes of high blood pressure include unhealthy lifestyle habits, being overweight or obese, and medicines.
                

                
Unhealthy Lifestyle Habits
                
Unhealthy lifestyle habits can cause high blood pressure, including:
                
High dietary sodium intake and sodium sensitivity
                
Drinking excess amounts of alcohol
                
Lack of physical activity
                

                
Overweight and Obesity
                
Research studies show that being overweight or obese can increase the resistance in the blood vessels, causing the heart to work harder and leading to high blood pressure.
                

                
Medicines
                
Prescription medicines such as asthma or hormone therapies, including birth control pills and estrogen, and over-the-counter medicines such as cold relief medicines may cause this form of high blood pressure. This happens because medicines can change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances, cause your blood vessels to constrict, or impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system leading to high blood pressure.
                
Other Medical Causes of High Blood Pressure
                
Other medical causes of high blood pressure include other medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea, thyroid problems, or certain tumors. This happens because these other conditions change the way your body controls fluids, sodium, and hormones in your blood, which leads to secondary high blood pressure.)

Answer: Blood pressure rises as body weight increases. Losing even 10 pounds can lower blood pressure -- and it has the greatest effect for those who are overweight and already have hypertension. If you are overweight or obese, work with your health care provider to develop a plan to help you lower your weight and maintain a healthy weight. Aim to reduce your weight by 7 to 10 percent over six months, which can lower your risk for health problems. For example, if you are overweight at 200 pounds, try to lose 14 to 20 pounds over six months. After that, you may have to continue to lose weight to get to a healthy weight.)

Answer: ""DASH"" stands for ""Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension."" This is the name of a clinical study that tested the effects of nutrients in food on blood pressure. Study results indicated that you can reduce high blood pressure by following an eating plan that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, and that is low in saturated fat, cholesterol, total fat, and added sugars. The DASH eating plan also includes whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts, and has reduced amounts of red meats, sweets, added sugars, and beverages containing sugars. A second study, called ""DASH-Sodium,"" showed that eating less salt also lowered blood pressure in people following either the DASH eating plan or the typical American diet. But those following DASH, especially those with high blood pressure, benefited the most.

Answer: High blood pressure is a common disease in which blood flows through blood vessels (arteries) at higher than normal pressures. What Is Blood Pressure? Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the blood vessels as the heart pumps blood. If your blood pressure rises and stays high over time, its called high blood pressure. High blood pressure is dangerous because it makes the heart work too hard, and the high force of the blood flow can harm arteries and organs such as the heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes. Types of High Blood Pressure There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure. - Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages.   - Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. This type usually resolves after the cause is treated or removed. Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages. Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. This type usually resolves after the cause is treated or removed. Measuring Blood Pressure Blood pressure is always given as two numbers, the systolic and diastolic pressures. Both are important. - Systolic Pressure  is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart beats.  -  Diastolic Pressure is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart is at rest between beats. Systolic Pressure  is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart beats.  Diastolic Pressure is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart is at rest between beats. Usually these numbers are written one above or before the other -- for example, 120/80 mmHg. The top, or first, number is the systolic and the bottom, or second number, is the diastolic. If your blood pressure is 120/80, you say that it is ""120 over 80."" Normal Blood Pressure Normal blood pressure for adults is defined as a systolic pressure below 120 mmHg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg. It is normal for blood pressures to change when you sleep, wake up, or are excited or nervous. When you are active, it is normal for your blood pressure to increase. However, once the activity stops, your blood pressure returns to your normal baseline range. Blood pressure normally rises with age and body size. Newborn babies often have very low blood pressure numbers that are considered normal for babies, while older teens have numbers similar to adults. Abnormal Blood Pressure Abnormal blood pressure is higher than 120/80 mmHg. If either your systolic or diastolic blood pressure is higher than normal (120/80) but not high enough to be considered high blood pressure (140/90), you have pre-hypertension. Pre-hypertension is a top number between 120 and 139 or a bottom number between 80 and 89 mmHg. For example, blood pressure readings of 138/82, 128/70, or 115/86 are all in the ""pre-hypertension"" range. (Click the table on the right to see the stages of high blood pressure in adults.) A systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher, or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or higher, is considered high blood pressure, or hypertension. Hypertension is the medical term for high blood pressure. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, your recommended blood pressure levels are a systolic blood pressure of 130 mmHg or lower, and a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg or lower. Usually Has No Symptoms High blood pressure is often called ""the silent killer"" because it usually has no symptoms. Occasionally, headaches may occur. Some people may not find out they have high blood pressure until they have trouble with their heart, kidneys, or eyes. When high blood pressure is not diagnosed and treated, it can lead to other life-threatening conditions, including heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and kidney failure. It can also lead to vision changes or blindness. Possible Complications Over Time Over time, high blood pressure can cause - your heart to work too hard and become larger or weaker, which can lead to heart failure.   - small bulges (aneurysms) to worsen in your blood vessels. Common locations for aneurysms are the aorta, which is the main artery from the heart; the arteries in your brain, legs, and intestines; and the artery leading to your spleen.  - blood vessels in your kidneys to narrow, which can cause kidney failure.  - blood vessels in your eyes to burst or bleed, which can cause vision changes and can result in blindness.   - arteries throughout your body to ""harden"" faster, especially those in your heart, brain, kidneys, and legs. This can cause a heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure. your heart to work too hard and become larger or weaker, which can lead to heart failure. small bulges (aneurysms) to worsen in your blood vessels.

Answer: Changes in Body Functions Researchers continue to study how various changes in normal body functions cause high blood pressure. The key functions affected in high blood pressure include -  kidney fluid and salt balances  -  the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system   - the sympathetic nervous system activity   - blood vessel structure and function. kidney fluid and salt balances the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system the sympathetic nervous system activity blood vessel structure and function. Kidney Fluid and Salt Balances The kidneys normally regulate the bodys salt balance by retaining sodium and water and eliminating potassium. Imbalances in this kidney function can expand blood volumes, which can cause high blood pressure. Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system makes angiotensin and aldosterone hormones. Angiotensin narrows or constricts blood vessels, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Aldosterone controls how the kidneys balance fluid and salt levels. Increased aldosterone levels or activity may change this kidney function, leading to increased blood volumes and high blood pressure. Sympathetic Nervous System Activity The sympathetic nervous system has important functions in blood pressure regulation, including heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. Researchers are investigating whether imbalances in this system cause high blood pressure.

Answer: Espaol
                
High blood pressure is a common disease in which blood flows through blood vessels (arteries) at higher than normal pressures.
                
Measuring Blood Pressure
                
Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood. High blood pressure, sometimes called hypertension, happens when this force is too high. Health care workers check blood pressure readings the same way for children, teens, and adults. They use a gauge, stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. With this equipment, they measure:
                
Systolic Pressure: blood pressure when the heart beats while pumping blood
                
Diastolic Pressure: blood pressure when the heart is at rest between beats
                
Health care workers write blood pressure numbers with the systolic number above the diastolic number. For example:
                

                
118/76 mmHg People read ""118 over 76"" millimeters of mercury.
                
Normal Blood Pressure
                
Normal blood pressure for adults is defined as a systolic pressure below 120 mmHg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg. It is normal for blood pressures to change when you sleep, wake up, or are excited or nervous. When you are active, it is normal for your blood pressure to increase. However, once the activity stops, your blood pressure returns to your normal baseline range.
                
Blood pressure normally rises with age and body size. Newborn babies often have very low blood pressure numbers that are considered normal for babies, while older teens have numbers similar to adults.
                
Abnormal Blood Pressure
                
Abnormal increases in blood pressure are defined as having blood pressures higher than 120/80 mmHg. The following table outlines and defines high blood pressure severity levels.
                
Stages of High Blood Pressure in Adults
                
The ranges in the table are blood pressure guides for adults who do not have any short-term serious illnesses. People with diabetes or chronic kidney disease should keep their blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg.
                
Although blood pressure increases seen in prehypertension are less than those used to diagnose high blood pressure, prehypertension can progress to high blood pressure and should be taken seriously. Over time, consistently high blood pressure weakens and damages your blood vessels, which can lead to complications.
                
Types of High Blood Pressure
                
There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure.
                
Primary High Blood Pressure
                
Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages.

When high blood pressure is not diagnosed and treated, it can lead to other life-threatening conditions, including heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and kidney failure. It can also lead to vision changes or blindness. Possible Complications Over Time Over time, high blood pressure can cause - your heart to work too hard and become larger or weaker, which can lead to heart failure.   - small bulges (aneurysms) to worsen in your blood vessels. Common locations for aneurysms are the aorta, which is the main artery from the heart; the arteries in your brain, legs, and intestines; and the artery leading to your spleen.  - blood vessels in your kidneys to narrow, which can cause kidney failure.  - blood vessels in your eyes to burst or bleed, which can cause vision changes and can result in blindness.   - arteries throughout your body to ""harden"" faster, especially those in your heart, brain, kidneys, and legs. This can cause a heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure. your heart to work too hard and become larger or weaker, which can lead to heart failure. small bulges (aneurysms) to worsen in your blood vessels.

NIHSeniorHealth_0000036_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes High Blood Pressure ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/highbloodpressure/toc.html
Answer: Changes in Body Functions Researchers continue to study how various changes in normal body functions cause high blood pressure. The key functions affected in high blood pressure include -  kidney fluid and salt balances  -  the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system   - the sympathetic nervous system activity   - blood vessel structure and function. kidney fluid and salt balances the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system the sympathetic nervous system activity blood vessel structure and function. Kidney Fluid and Salt Balances The kidneys normally regulate the bodys salt balance by retaining sodium and water and eliminating potassium. Imbalances in this kidney function can expand blood volumes, which can cause high blood pressure. Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system makes angiotensin and aldosterone hormones. Angiotensin narrows or constricts blood vessels, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Aldosterone controls how the kidneys balance fluid and salt levels. Increased aldosterone levels or activity may change this kidney function, leading to increased blood volumes and high blood pressure. Sympathetic Nervous System Activity The sympathetic nervous system has important functions in blood pressure regulation, including heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. Researchers are investigating whether imbalances in this system cause high blood pressure. Blood Vessel Structure and Function Changes in the structure and function of small and large arteries may contribute to high blood pressure. The angiotensin pathway and the immune system may stiffen small and large arteries, which can affect blood pressure. Genetic Causes High blood pressure often runs in families. Years of research have identified many genes and other mutations associated with high blood pressure. However, known genetic factors only account for 2 to 3 percent of all cases. Emerging research suggests that certain DNA changes before birth also may cause the development of high blood pressure later in life. Unhealthy Lifestyle Habits Unhealthy lifestyle habits can cause high blood pressure, including - high sodium intake and sodium sensitivity  - drinking too much alcohol  - lack of physical activity. high sodium intake and sodium sensitivity drinking too much alcohol lack of physical activity. Overweight and Obesity Research studies show that being overweight or obese can increase the resistance in the blood vessels, causing the heart to work harder and leading to high blood pressure. Medicines Prescription medicines such as asthma or hormone therapies (including birth control pills and estrogen) and over-the-counter medicines such as cold relief medicines may cause high blood pressure. This happens because medicines can - change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances  - cause your blood vessels to constrict  -  impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to high blood pressure.  change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances cause your blood vessels to constrict impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to high blood pressure. Other Causes Other causes of high blood pressure include medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea, thyroid problems, or certain tumors. These conditions can change the way your body controls fluids, sodium, and hormones in your blood, which leads to secondary high blood pressure.)

NIHSeniorHealth_0000036_Sec6.txt,"Question: What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/highbloodpressure/toc.html
Answer: Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the blood vessels as the heart pumps blood. If your blood pressure rises and stays high over time, its called high blood pressure. High blood pressure is dangerous because it makes the heart work too hard, and the high force of the blood flow can harm arteries and organs such as the heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes.)

NIHSeniorHealth_0000036_Sec7.txt,"Question: What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/highbloodpressure/toc.html
Answer: Normal blood pressure for adults is defined as a systolic pressure below 120 mmHg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg. It is normal for blood pressures to change when you sleep, wake up, or are excited or nervous. When you are active, it is normal for your blood pressure to increase. However, once the activity stops, your blood pressure returns to your normal baseline range. Blood pressure normally rises with age and body size. Newborn babies often have very low blood pressure numbers that are considered normal for babies, while older teens have numbers similar to adults.)

NIHSeniorHealth_0000036_Sec8.txt,"Question: What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/highbloodpressure/toc.html
Answer: High blood pressure is a common disease in which blood flows through blood vessels (arteries) at higher than normal pressures. There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure. Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages. Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. This type usually resolves after the cause is treated or removed.)

ADAM_0000707_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Cataract removal (Also called: Cataract extraction; Cataract surgery)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002957.htm
Answer: Summary : Cataract removal is surgery to remove a clouded lens (cataract) from the eye. Cataracts are removed to help you see better. The procedure almost always includes placing an artificial lens (IOL) in the eye.

Description : Cataract surgery is an outpatient procedure. This means you likely do not have to stay overnight at a hospital. The surgery is performed by an ophthalmologist. This is a medical doctor who specializes in eye diseases and eye surgery.  Adults are usually awake for the procedure. Numbing medicine (local anesthesia) is given using eyedrops or a shot. This blocks pain. You will also get medicine to help you relax. Children usually receive general anesthesia. This makes them unconscious and unable to feel pain.  The doctor uses a special microscope to view the eye. A small cut (incision) is made in the eye.   The lens is removed in one of the following ways, depending on the type of cataract:   - Phacoemulsification: With this procedure, the doctor uses a tool that produces sound waves to break up the cataract into small pieces. The pieces are then suctioned out. This procedure uses a very small incision.  - Extracapsular extraction: The doctor uses a small tool to remove the cataract in mostly one piece. This procedure uses a larger incision.   - Laser surgery: The doctor guides a machine that uses laser energy to make the incisions and soften the cataract. The rest of the surgery is much like phacoemulsification. Using the laser instead of a knife (scalpel) may speed recovery and be more accurate.    After the cataract is removed, a manmade lens, called an intraocular lens (IOL), is usually placed into the eye to restore the focusing power of the lens (cataract). It helps improve your vision.  The doctor may close the incision with very small stitches. Usually, a self-sealing (sutureless) method is used. If you have stitches, they may need to be removed later.  The surgery lasts less than half an hour. Most times, just one eye is done. If you have cataracts in both eyes, your doctor may suggest waiting at least 1 to 2 weeks between each surgery.

Why the Procedure is Performed : The normal lens of the eye is clear (transparent). As a cataract develops, the lens becomes cloudy. This blocks light from entering your eye. Without enough light, you cannot see as clearly.  Cataracts are painless. They are most often seen in older adults. Sometimes, children are born with them. Cataract surgery is usually done if you cannot see well enough because of cataracts. Cataracts usually do not damage your eye, so you and your eye doctor can decide when surgery is right for you.

Risks : In rare cases, the entire lens cannot be removed. If this happens, a procedure to remove all of the lens fragments will be done at a later time. Afterward, vision can still be improved.  Very rare complications can include infection and bleeding. This can lead to permanent vision problems.

Before the Procedure : Before surgery, you will have a complete eye exam and eye tests by the ophthalmologist.   The doctor will use ultrasound or a laser scanning device to measure your eye. These tests help determine the best IOL for you. Usually, the doctor will try to choose an IOL that can allow you to see without glasses or contact lenses after surgery. Be sure you understand what your vision will be like after the IOL is implanted.  Your doctor may prescribe eyedrops before the surgery. Follow instructions exactlyon how to use the drops.

After the Procedure : Before you go home, you may receive the following:  - A patch to wear over your eye until the follow-up exam  - Eyedrops to prevent infection, treat inflammation, and help with healing   You will need to have someone drive you home after surgery.   You will usually have a follow-up exam with your doctor the next day. If you had stitches, you will need to make an appointment to have them removed.  Tips for recovering after cataract surgery:  - Wear dark sunglasses outside after you remove the patch.  - Wash your hands well before and after using eyedrops and touching your eye. Try not to get soap and water in your eye when you are bathing or showering for the first few days.  - Light activities are best as you recover. Check with your doctor before doing any strenuous activity, resuming sexual activity, or driving.   Recovery takes about 2 weeks. If you need new glasses or contact lenses, you can usually have them fitted at that time. Keep your follow-up visit with your doctor.

Outlook (Prognosis) : Most people do well and recover quickly after cataract surgery.  If a person has other eye problems, such as glaucoma or macular degeneration, the surgery may be more difficult or the outcome may not be as good.)

ADAM_0000969_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Contraindication ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002314.htm
Answer: A contraindication is a specific situation in which a drug, procedure, or surgery should not be used because it may be harmful to the person.  There are two types of contraindications:  - Relative contraindication means that caution should be used when two drugs or procedures are used together. (It is acceptable to do so if the benefits outweigh the risk.)  - Absolute contraindication means that event or substance could cause a life-threatening situation. A procedure or medicine that falls under this category should be avoided.    Some treatments may cause unwanted or dangerous reactions in people with allergies, high blood pressure, or pregnancy. For example, isotretinoin, a drug used to treat acne is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of birth defects. Certain decongestants are contraindicated in people with high blood pressure and should be avoided.  Many medicines should not be used together by the same person. For instance, a person who takes warfarin to thin the blood should not take aspirin, which is a blood thinner. This is an example of a relative contraindication.)

ADAM_0001041_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Crying - excessive (0 to 6 months) (Also called: Excessive crying (infants 0 to 6 months))
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003023.htm
Answer: Summary : Infants normally cry about 1 to 3 hours a day. It is perfectly normal for an infant to cry when hungry, thirsty, tired, lonely, or in pain. It is also normal for a baby to have a fussy period in the evening.  But, if an infant cries too often, it may be a sign of something that needs treatment.

Causes : Infants may cry because of any of the following:  - Boredom or loneliness  - Colic  - Discomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or feeling cold  - Hunger or thirst  - Illness  - Infection (a likely cause if the crying is accompanied by irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, or fever. You should call your baby's health care provider)  - Medicines  - Normal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep  - Pain  - Teething

Home Care : Home care depends on the causes. Follow your provider's advice.   If the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.  If crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.  Take your baby's temperature to check for fever. Check your baby head-to-toe for any injuries. Pay particular attention to the fingers, toes, and genitalia. It is not uncommon for a hair to get wrapped around part of your baby, such as a toe, creating pain.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Call the provider if:  - A baby's excessive crying remains unexplained and does not go away in 1 day, despite attempts at home treatment  - The baby has other symptoms, such as fever, along with the excessive crying

What to Expect at Your Office Visit : The provider will examine your baby and ask about the child's medical history and symptoms. Questions may include:  - Is the child teething?  - Is the child bored, lonely, hungry, thirsty?  - Does the child seem to have a lot of gas?  - What other symptoms does the child have? Such as, difficulty waking up, fever, irritability, poor appetite, or vomiting?    The provider will check the infant's growth and development. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the baby has a bacterial infection.)

ADAM_0001562_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Feeding patterns and diet - children 6 months to 2 years
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000713.htm
Answer: Summary : An age-appropriate diet:  - Gives your child proper nutrition  - Is right for your child's state of development  - Can help prevent childhood obesity

Recommendations : 6 to 8 MONTHS  At this age, your baby will probably eat about 4 to 6 times per day, but will eat more at each feeding than the first 6 months.  - If you feed formula, your baby will eat about 6 to 8 ounces per feeding, but should not have more than 32 ounces in 24 hours.  - You can start to introduce solid foods at age 6 months. Most of your baby's calories should still come from breast milk or formula.  - Breast milk is not a good source of iron. So after 6 months, your baby will start to need more iron in their diet. Start solid feedings with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula. Mix it with enough milk so that the texture is very thin. Start by offering the cereal 2 times a day, in just a few spoonfuls.  - You can make the mixture thicker as your baby learns to control it in her mouth.  - You can also introduce iron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables. Try green peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, pears, bananas, and peaches.  - Some dietitians recommend introducing a few vegetables before fruits. The sweetness of fruit may make some vegetables less appealing.  - The amount your child eats will vary between 2 tablespoons and 2 cups of fruits and vegetables per day. How much your child eats depends on their size and how well they eat fruits and vegetables.    There are several ways you can tell that your baby is ready to eat solid foods:  - Your baby's birth weight has doubled.  - Your baby can control their head and neck movements.  - Your baby can sit up with some support.  - Your baby can show you they are full by turning their head away or by not opening their mouth.  - Your baby begins showing interest in food when others are eating.    You should also know:  - Never give honey to your baby. It may contain bacteria that can cause botulism, a rare but serious illness.  - DO NOT give your baby cow's milk until they are 1 year old. Babies under age 1 have a difficult time digesting cow's milk.  - Never put your child to bed with a bottle. This can cause tooth decay. If your baby wants to suck, give them a pacifier.  - Use a small spoon when feeding your baby.  - It is fine to start to give your baby water between feedings.  - DO NOT give your baby cereal in a bottle unless your pediatrician or dietitian recommends it, for example, for reflux.  - Only offer your child new foods when they are hungry.  - Introduce new foods one at a time, waiting 2 to 3 days between. That way you can watch for allergic reactions. Signs of an allergy include diarrhea, rash, or vomiting.  - Avoid foods with added salt or sugar.  - Feed your baby directly from the jar only if you use the entire jar contents. Otherwise, use a dish to prevent food-borne illness.  - Opened containers of baby's food should be covered and stored in a refrigerator for no longer than 2 days.    8 to 12 MONTHS OF AGE  At this age, you can offer finger foods in small amounts. Your baby will probably let you know they are ready to start feeding themselves by grabbing the food or spoon with their hand.  Good finger foods include:  - Soft cooked vegetables  - Washed and peeled fruits  - Graham crackers  - Melba toast  - Noodles    You can also introduce teething foods, such as:  - Toast strips  - Unsalted crackers and bagels  - Teething biscuits    Continue to offer your baby breast milk or formula 3 to 4 times per day at this age.  You should also know:  - Avoid foods that may cause choking, such as apple chunks or slices, grapes, berries, raisins, dry flake cereals, hot dogs, sausages, peanut butter, popcorn, nuts, seeds, round candies, and raw vegetables.  - You can give your child egg yolks 3 to 4 times per week. Some babies are sensitive to egg whites. So DO NOT offer them until after age 1.  - You can offer small amounts of cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt, but no cow's milk.  - By age 1, most children are off the bottle. If your child still uses a bottle, it should contain water only.    1 YEARof AGE  - At this age, you may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula.  - Most mothers in the U.S. wean their babies by this age. But it is also fine to continue to nurse if you and your baby want to.  - DO NOT give your child low-fat milk (2%, 1%, or skim) until after age 2. Your baby needs the extra calories from fat to grow and develop.  - At this age, your baby will get most of their nutrition from proteins, fruits and vegetables, breads and grains, and dairy. You can make sure your baby gets all the vitamins and minerals they need by offering a variety of foods.  - Your child will start to crawl and walk and be much more active. They will eat smaller amounts at a time, but will eat more often (4 to 6 times a day). Having snacks on hand is a good idea.  - At this age, their growing slows. They will not double in size like they did when they were an infant.    You should also know:  - If your child dislikes a new food, try giving it again later. Often it takes several tries for children to take to new foods.  - DO NOT give your child sweets or sweetened beverages. They can spoil their appetite and cause tooth decay.  - Avoid salt, strong spices, and caffeine products, including soft drinks, coffee, tea, and chocolate.  - If your baby is fussy, they may need attention, rather than food.    2 YEARS of AGE  - After your child turns 2, your child's diet should be moderately low in fat. A high-fat diet can lead to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems later in life.  - Your child should eat a variety of foods from each of the food groups: breads and grains, proteins, fruits and vegetables, and dairy.  - If your water is not fluoridated, it is a good idea to use toothpaste or mouthwash with fluoride added.    All children need plenty of calcium to support their growing bones. But not all kids get enough. Good sources of calcium include:  - Low-fat or nonfat milk, yogurt, and cheese  - Cooked greens  - Canned salmon (with bones)    If your child's diet is balanced and healthy, they should not need a vitamin supplement. Some kids are picky eaters, but usually they still get all the nutrients they need. If you are concerned, ask your health care provider whether your child needs a children's multivitamin.

When to Call Your Child's Health Care Provider : Call the provider if you are concerned your child:  - Is not eating enough  - Is eating too much  - Is gaining too much or too little weight  - Has an allergic reaction to food)

ADAM_0004157_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Using your shoulder after replacement surgery (Also called: Joint replacement surgery - using your shoulder; Shoulder replacement surgery - after)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000176.htm
Answer: Summary : You have had shoulder replacement surgery to replace the bones of your shoulder joint with artificial parts. The parts include a stem made of metal and a metal ball that fits on the top of the stem. A plastic piece is used as the new surface of the shoulder blade.  Now that you are home you will need to know how to protect your shoulder as it heals.

Self-care : You will need to wear a sling for the first 6 weeks after surgery. You may want to wear the sling for extra support or protection after that. You may also wear a shoulder immobilizer to keep the joint in place.  Rest your shoulder on a rolled up towel or small pillow when lying down. This helps prevent damage to your shoulder from the stretching of the muscles or tendons. You will need to keep doing this for 6 to 8 weeks after your surgery, even when wearing a sling.  Your surgeon or physical therapist may teach you pendulum exercises to do at home for 4 to 6 weeks. To do these exercises:  - Lean over and support your weight with your good arm on a counter or table.  - Hang your arm that had surgery down.  - Very carefully and slowly swing your loose arm around in circles.    Your surgeon or physical therapist will also teach you safe ways to move your arm and shoulder:  - DO NOT try to lift or move your shoulder without supporting it with your good arm or having someone else support it. Your surgeon or therapist will tell you when it is ok to lift or move your shoulder without this support.  - Use your other (good) arm to move the arm that had surgery. Move it only as far as your doctor or physical therapist tells you is ok.    These exercises and movements may hard but they will get easier over time. It is very important to do these as your surgeon or therapist showed you. Doing these exercises will help your shoulder get better faster. They will help you be more actives after you recover.  Activities and movements you should try to avoid are:  - Reaching or using your shoulder a lot  - Lifting objects heavier than a cup of coffee  - Supporting your body weight with your hand on the side you had surgery  - Making sudden jerking movements    Wear the sling all the time unless your surgeon says you do not have to.  After 4 to 6 weeks, your surgeon or physical therapist will show you other exercises to stretch your shoulder and gain more movement in your joint.  Returning to sports and other activities  Ask your surgeon which sports and other activities are ok for you after you recover.  Always think about how to safely use your shoulder before you move or start an activity. To protect your new shoulder avoid:  - Activities that require doing the same movement over and over again with your shoulder, such as weight lifting.  - ""Jamming"" activities, such as hammering.  - ""Impact-loading"" sports, such as boxing.  - Any physical activities that need quick stop-start motions or twisting.    You will probably not be able to drive for at least 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. You should not drive when you are taking narcotics. Your surgeon or physical therapist will tell you when driving is ok.

When to Call the Doctor : Call your surgeon or nurse if you have any of the following:  - Bleeding that soaks through your dressing and does not stop when you place pressure over the area  - Pain that does not go away when you take your pain medicine  - Swelling in your arm  - Your hand or fingers are darker in color or feel cool to the touch  - Redness, pain, swelling, or a yellowish discharge from the wound  - Fever of 101F (38.3C) or higher  - Shortness of breath  - Your new shoulder joint does not feel secure and feels like it is moving around

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000175.htm
Answer: Summary : You had surgery on your shoulder to repair a muscle, tendon, or cartilage tear. The surgeon may have removed damaged tissue. You will need to know how to take care of your shoulder as it heals, and how to make it stronger.

Self-care : After surgery, your arm will be in a sling or an immobilizer. Wear the device at all times, unless the surgeon says you do not have to.   - It is ok to straighten your arm below your elbow and move your wrist and hand. But try to move your arm as little as possible.  - Your arm should bend at a 90 angle (a right angle) at your elbow. The sling should support your wrist and hand so that they do not extend past the sling.  - Move your fingers, hand, and wrist around 3 to 4 times during the day while they are in the sling. Each time, do this 10 to 15 times.  - When the surgeon tells you to, begin taking your arm out of the sling and let it hang loosely by your side. Do this for longer periods each day.    If you wear a shoulder immobilizer, you can loosen it only at the wrist strap and straighten your arm at your elbow. Be careful not to move your shoulder when you do this. DO NOT take off the immobilizer all the way unless the surgeon tells you it is ok.  If you had rotator cuff surgery or other ligament or labral surgery, you need to be careful with your shoulder. Ask the surgeon what arm movements are safe to do.  - DO NOT move your arm away from your body or over your head.  - When you sleep, raise your upper body up on pillows. DO NOT lie flat. You can also try sleeping on a reclining chair.    You may also be told not to use your or hand on the side that had surgery. For example, DO NOT:  - Lift anything with this arm or hand.  - Lean on the arm or put any weight on it.  - Bring objects toward your stomach by pulling in with this arm and hand.  - Move or twist your elbow behind your body to reach for anything.    Your surgeon will refer you to a physical therapist to learn exercises for your shoulder.  - You will probably start with passive exercises. These are exercises the therapist will do with your arm. They help get the full movement back in your shoulder.  - After that you will do exercises the therapist teaches you. These will help increase the strength in your shoulder and the muscles around your shoulder.    Consider making some changes around your home so it is easier for you to take care of yourself. Store everyday items you use in places you can reach easily. Keep things with you that you use a lot (such as your phone).

When to Call the Doctor : Call your surgeon or nurse if you have any of the following:  - Bleeding that soaks through your dressing and does not stop when you place pressure over the area  - Pain that does not go away when you take your pain medicine  - Swelling in your arm  - Your hand or fingers are darker in color or feel cool to the touch  - Numbness or tingling in your fingers or hand  - Redness, pain, swelling, or a yellowish discharge from any of the wounds  - Fever of 101F (38.3C), or higher  - Shortness of breath

Secondary cataracts can form after surgery for other eye problems, such as glaucoma. They also can develop in people who have other health problems, such as diabetes. Secondary cataracts are sometimes linked to steroid use. Traumatic cataracts can develop after an eye injury, sometimes years later. Some babies are born with cataracts or develop them in childhood, often in both eyes. These congenital cataracts may be so small that they do not affect vision. If they do, the lenses may need to be removed. Radiation cataracts can develop after exposure to some types of radiation.)

NIHSeniorHealth_0000009_Sec13.txt,"Question: What is (are) Cataract ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/cataract/toc.html
Answer: Yes. There are two types of cataract surgery, phacoemulsification and extracapsular surgery. Your doctor can explain the differences and help determine which is better for you. With phacoemulsification, or phaco, a small incision is made on the side of the cornea, the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye. Your doctor inserts a tiny probe into the eye. This device emits ultrasound waves that soften and break up the lens so that it can be removed by suction. Most cataract surgery today is done by phacoemulsification, also called ""small incision cataract surgery."" With extracapsular surgery, your doctor makes a longer incision on the side of the cornea and removes the cloudy core of the lens in one piece. The rest of the lens is removed by suction.)

Answer: A Clouding of the Lens in the Eye A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye that affects vision. The lens is a clear part of the eye that helps to focus light, or an image, on the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. In a normal eye, light passes through the transparent lens to the retina. Once it reaches the retina, light is changed into nerve signals that are sent to the brain.

ADAM_0001230_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Dietary fats explained
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000104.htm
Answer: Summary : Fats are a type of nutrient that you get from your diet. It is essential to eat some fats, though it is also harmful to eat too many.  The fats you eat give your body energy that it needs to work properly. During exercise, your body uses calories from carbohydrates you have eaten. But after 20 minutes, exercise then depends on calories from fat to keep you going.  You also need fat to keep your skin and hair healthy. Fat also helps you absorb vitamins A, D, E, and K, the so-called fat-soluble vitamins. Fat also fills your fat cells and insulates your body to help keep you warm.  The fats your body gets from your food give your body essential fatty acids called linoleic and linolenic acid. They are called ""essential"" because your body cannot make them itself, or work without them. Your body needs them for brain development, controlling inflammation, and blood clotting.  Fat has 9 calories per gram, more than 2 times the number of calories in carbohydrates and protein, which each have 4 calories per gram.   All fats are made up of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Fats are called saturated or unsaturated depending on how much of each type of fatty acid they contain.

Types of Fat : Saturated fats raise your LDL (""bad"") cholesterol level. High LDL cholesterol puts you at risk for heart attack, stroke, and other major health problems. You should avoid or limit foods that are high in saturated fats.  - Keep saturated fats to less than 6% of your total daily calories.  - Foods with a lot of saturated fats are animal products, such as butter, cheese, whole milk, ice cream, cream, and fatty meats.  - Some vegetable oils, such ascoconut, palm, and palm kernel oil, also contain saturated fats. These fats are solid at room temperature.  - A diet high in saturated fat increases cholesterol buildup in your arteries (blood vessels). Cholesterol is a soft, waxy substance that can cause clogged, or blocked, arteries.    Eating unsaturated fats instead of saturated fats can help lower your LDL cholesterol. Most vegetable oils that are liquid at room temperature have unsaturated fats. There are two kinds of unsaturated fats:  - Mono-unsaturated fats, which include olive and canola oil  - Polyunsaturated fats, which include safflower, sunflower, corn, and soy oil    Trans fatty acids are unhealthy fats that form when vegetable oil hardens in a process called hydrogenation. Hydrogenated fats, or ""trans fats,"" are often used to keep some foods fresh for a long time.  Trans fats are also used for cooking in some restaurants. They can raise LDL cholesterol levels in your blood. They can also lower your HDL (""good"") cholesterol levels.  Trans fats are under review for their health effects. Experts are working to limit the amount of trans fats used in packaged foods and restaurants.  You should avoid foods made with hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils (such as hard butter and margarine). They contain high levels of trans-fatty acids.   It is important to read nutrition labels on foods. This will help you know what kinds of fats, and how much, your food contains.   Talk with your health care provider about how to cut down on the amount of fat you eat. Your doctor can refer you to a dietitian who can help you learn more about foods and help you plan a healthy diet. Make sure you have your cholesterol levels checked according to a schedule your health care provider gives you.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000531.htm
Answer: Summary : It is normal for a person who is dying to not feel like eating. A serious illness can cause body systems that manage fluids and food to change at this time. They can slow down and fail. Also, medicine that treats pain can cause dry, hard stools that are difficult to pass.

NIDDK_0000102_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Gas in the Digestive Tract ?
URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/gas/Pages/facts.aspx
Answer: Gas is air in the digestive tractthe large, muscular tube that extends from the mouth to the anus, where the movement of muscles, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gas leaves the body when people burp through the mouth or pass gas through the anus.
                
Gas is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sometimes methane. Flatus, gas passed through the anus, may also contain small amounts of gasses that contain sulfur. Flatus that contains more sulfur gasses has more odor.
                
Everyone has gas. However, many people think they burp or pass gas too often and that they have too much gas. Having too much gas is rare.)

ADAM_0002802_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Nicotine replacement therapy (Also called: Smoking cessation - nicotine replacement; Tobacco - nicotine replacement therapy)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007438.htm
Answer: Summary : Nicotine replacement therapy is a treatment to help people stop smoking. It uses products that supply low doses of nicotine. These products do not contain many of the toxins found in smoke. The goal of therapy is to cut down on cravings for nicotine and ease the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.   Facts about using nicotine replacement therapy:  - The more cigarettes you smoke, the higher the dose you may need to start.  - Adding a counseling program will make you more likely to quit.  - DO NOT smoke while using nicotine replacement. It can cause nicotine to build up to toxic levels.  - Nicotine replacement helps prevent weight gain while you are using it. You may still gain weight when you stop all nicotine use.  - The dose of nicotine should be slowly decreased.   TYPES OF NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY  Nicotine supplements come in many forms:  - Gum  - Inhalers  - Lozenges  - Nasal spray  - Skin patch    All of these work well if they are used correctly. People are more likely to use the gum and patches correctly than other forms.  Nicotine Patch  All nicotine patches are placed and used in similar ways:  - A single patch is worn each day. It is replaced after 24 hours.  - Place the patch on different areas above the waist and below the neck each day.  - Put the patch on a hairless spot.  - People who wear the patches for 24 hours will have fewer withdrawal symptoms.  - If wearing the patch at night causes odd dreams, try sleeping without the patch.  - People who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes per day should start with a lower dose patch (for example, 14 mg).    Nicotine Gum or Lozenge  You can buy nicotine gum or lozenges without a prescription. Some people prefer lozenges to the patch, because they can control the nicotine dose.  Tips for using the gum:  - If you are just starting to quit, chew 1 to 2 pieces each hour. DO NOT chew more than 20 pieces a day.  - Chew the gum slowly until it develops a peppery taste. Then, tuck it between the gum and cheek and store it there. This lets the nicotine be absorbed.  - The goal is to stop using the gum by 6 months. Using nicotine gum long-term may be safer than smoking, but research is needed to confirm this.  - Wait at least 15 minutes after drinking coffee, tea, soft drinks, and acidic beverages before chewing a piece of gum.  - People who smoke more than 25 cigarettes per day have better results with the 4 mg dose than with the 2 mg dose.    Nicotine Inhaler  The nicotine inhaler looks like a plastic cigarette holder. It requires a prescription in the United States.  - Insert nicotine cartridges into the inhaler and ""puff"" for about 20 minutes. Do this up to 16 times a day.  - The inhaler is quick-acting. It takes about the same time as the gum to act. It is faster than the 2 to 4 hours it takes for the patch to work.  - The inhaler satisfies oral urges.  - Most of the nicotine vapor does not go into the airways of the lung. Some people have mouth or throat irritation and cough with the inhaler.    It can help to use the inhaler and patch together when quitting.  Nicotine Nasal Spray  The nasal spray provides a quick dose of nicotine to satisfy a craving you are unable to ignore. Levels of nicotine peak within 5 to 10 minutes after using the spray.   - It may be used along with the patch.  - The spray can irritate the nose, eyes, and throat. These side effects often go away in a few days.   SIDE EFFECTS AND RISKS  All nicotine products may cause side effects. Symptoms are more likely when you use very high doses. Reducing the dose can prevent these symptoms. Side effects include:  - Headaches  - Nausea and other digestive problems  - Problems getting to sleep in the first few days, most often with the patch. This problem usually passes.   SPECIAL CONCERNS  Nicotine patches are okay for use by most people with stable heart or blood circulation problems. But, the unhealthy cholesterol levels (lower HDL level) caused by smoking do not get better until the nicotine patch is stopped.  Nicotine replacement may not be completely safe in pregnant women. The unborn children of women who use the patch may have a faster heart rate.  Keep all nicotine products away from children.   - The concern is greater for small children. Nicotine is a poison.  - Call the doctor or a poison control center right away if a child has been exposed to a nicotine replacement product, even for a short time.)

Its leaves are smoked, chewed, or sniffed for a variety of effects.  - Tobacco contains the chemical nicotine, which is an addictive substance.  - Tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, 69 of which are known to cause cancer.  - Tobacco that is not burned is called smokeless tobacco. Including nicotine, there are 29 chemicals in smokeless tobacco that are known to cause cancer.     HEALTH RISKS OF SMOKING OR USING SMOKELESS TOBACCO   Knowing the serious health risks of using tobacco may help motivate you to quit. Using tobacco over a long time can increase your risk of many health problems.  Heart and blood vessel problems:  - Blood clots and weakness in the walls of blood vessels in the brain, which can lead to stroke  - Blood clots in the legs, which may travel to the lungs  - Coronary artery disease, including angina and heart attacks  - Temporarily increased blood pressure after smoking  - Poor blood supply to the legs  - Problems with erections because of decreased blood flow into the penis    Other health risks or problems:   - Cancer (more likely in the lung, mouth, larynx, nose and sinuses, throat, esophagus, stomach, bladder, kidney, pancreas, cervix, colon, and rectum)  - Poor wound healing after surgery  - Lung problems, such as COPD or asthma that is harder to control  - Problems during pregnancy, such as babies born at a low birth weight, early labor, losing your baby, and cleft lip  - Decreased ability to taste and smell  - Harm to sperm, which may lead to infertility  - Loss of sight due to an increased risk of macular degeneration  - Tooth and gum diseases  - Wrinkling of the skin    Smokers who switch to smokeless tobacco instead of quitting tobacco still have health risks:  - Increased risk of mouth or nasal cancer  - Gum problems, tooth wear, and cavities  - Worsening high blood pressure and angina     HEALTH RISKS OF SECONDHAND SMOKE   Those who are often around the smoke of others (secondhand smoke) have a higher risk of:  - Heart attack and heart disease  - Lung cancer  - Sudden and severe reactions, including of the eye, nose, throat, and lower respiratory tract    Infants and children who are often exposed to secondhand smoke are at risk of:  - Asthma flares (children with asthma who live with a smoker are much more likely to visit the emergency room)  - Infections of the mouth, throat, sinuses, ears, and lungs  - Lung damage (poor lung function)  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)    Like any addiction, quitting tobacco is difficult, especially if you are doing it alone.   - Seek support from family members, friends, and coworkers.  - Talk to your health care provider about nicotine replacement therapy and smoking cessation medications.  - Join a smoking cessation program and you will have a much better chance of success. Such programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, and work sites.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000504.htm
Answer: Things that make your allergies or asthma worse are called triggers. Smoking is a trigger for many people who have asthma. It is important to know your triggers because avoiding them is your first step toward controlling your asthma.   You do not have to be a smoker for smoking to cause harm. Exposure to someone else's smoking (called secondhand smoke) is a trigger for asthma attacks in children and adults.   Smoking weakens the lungs. When you have asthma and you smoke, your lungs will weaken more rapidly. Smoking around children with asthma will weaken their lungs, too.)

Answer: Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Smoking is also a trigger for COPD flare-ups. Smoking damages the air sacs, airways, and the lining of your lungs. Injured lungs have trouble moving enough air in and out, so it's hard to breathe.  Things that make chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptoms worse are called triggers. Knowing what your triggers are and how to avoid them can help you feel better. Smoking is a trigger for many people who have COPD. Smoking can cause an exacerbation, or flare-up, of your symptoms.  You do not have to be a smoker for smoking to cause harm. Exposure to someone else's smoking (called secondhand smoke) is also a trigger for COPD flare-ups.  Smoking damages your lungs. When you have COPD and smoke, your lungs will get damaged more rapidly than if you were to stop smoking.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007440.htm
Answer: Summary : It is hard to quit smoking if you are acting alone. Smokers may have a much better chance of quitting with a support program. Stop smoking programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations.  You can find out about smoking cessation programs from:   - Your doctor or local hospital  - Your health insurance plan  - Your employer  - Your local health department  - The National Cancer Institute at 877-448-7848  - The American Cancer Society's Quitline at 800-227-2345  - The American Lung Association, which has online and phone advice programs  - State programs in all 50 states and the District of Columbia    The best smoking cessation programs combine numerous approaches and target the fears and problems you have when quitting. They also provide ongoing support for staying away from tobacco.  Be wary of programs that:  - Are short and offer no help over time  - Charge a high fee  - Offer supplements or pills that are only available through the program  - Promise an easy path to quitting    Telephone-based help  Telephone-based services can help you design a stop smoking program that meets your needs. These services are easy to use. The counselors can help you avoid common mistakes. This kind of support can be as effective as face-to-face counseling.  Telephone programs are often available on nights and weekends. Trained counselors will help you set up a support network for quitting and help you decide which stop smoking aids to use. Choices may include:  - Medicines  - Nicotine replacement therapy  - Support programs or classes    Support groups  Let your friends, family, and coworkers know of your plans to stop smoking and your quit date. It helps for people around you to be aware of what you are going through, especially when you are grumpy.  You may also want to seek out other types of support, such as:  - Your family doctor or nurse.  - Groups of ex-smokers.  - Nicotine Anonymous. This organization uses a similar approach as Alcoholics Anonymous. As part of this group, you will be asked to admit that you are powerless over your addiction to nicotine. Also, a sponsor is often available to help you get through urges to smoke.    Stop smoking programs and classes  Stop smoking programs can also help you find a quitting method that suits your needs. They will help you be aware of problems that come up while you're trying to quit and offer tools to cope with these problems. These programs can help you avoid making common mistakes.   Programs may either have one-on-one sessions or group counseling. Some programs offer both. Programs should be run by counselors who are trained to help people quit smoking.  Programs that provide more sessions or longer sessions have a better chance of success. The American Cancer Society recommends programs like the following:  - Each session lasts at least 15 to 30 minutes.  - There are at least 4 sessions.  - The program lasts at least 2 weeks, although longer is usually better.  - The leader is trained in smoking cessation.    Internet-based programs are also becoming more available. These services send you personalized reminders using e-mail, texting, or other methods.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/quittingsmoking.html
Answer: Summary : Tobacco use is the most common preventable cause of death. About half of the people who don't quit smoking will die of smoking-related problems. Quitting smoking is important for your health.    Soon after you quit, your circulation begins to improve, and your blood pressure starts to return to normal. Your sense of smell and taste return, and it's easier for you to breathe. In the long term, giving up tobacco can help you live longer. Your risk of getting cancer decreases with each year you stay smoke-free.    Quitting is not easy. You may have short-term affects such as weight gain, irritability, and anxiety. Some people try several times before they succeed. There are many ways to quit smoking. Some people stop ""cold turkey."" Others benefit from step-by-step manuals, counseling, or medicines or products that help reduce nicotine addiction. Some people think that switching to e-cigarettes can help you quit smoking, but that has not been proven. Your health care provider can help you find the best way for you to quit.

ADAM_0002800_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Nicotine and tobacco (Also called: Withdrawal from nicotine; Smoking - nicotine addiction and withdrawal; Smokeless tobacco - nicotine addiction; Cigar smoking; Pipe smoking; Smokeless snuff; Tobacco use; Chewing tobacco; Nicotine addiction and tobacco)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000953.htm
Answer: Summary : The nicotine in tobacco can be addictive like alcohol, cocaine, and morphine.

Causes : Tobacco is a plant grown for its leaves, which are smoked, chewed, or sniffed.   - Tobacco contains a chemical called nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive substance.  - Millions of people in the U.S. have been able to quit smoking. Although the number of cigarette smokers in the U.S. has dropped in recent years, the number of smokeless tobacco users has steadily increased. Smokeless tobacco products are either placed in the mouth, cheek, or lip and sucked or chewed on, or placed in the nasal passage. The nicotine in these products is absorbed at the same rate as smoking tobacco, and addiction is still very strong.    Both smoking and smokeless tobacco use carry many health risks.

Symptoms : Nicotine use can have many different effects on the body. It can:  - Decrease the appetite; fear of weight gain makes some people unwilling to stop smoking  - Boost mood, give people a sense of well-being, and possibly even relieve minor depression  - Increase activity in the intestines  - Create more saliva and phlegm  - Increase the heart rate by around 10 to 20 beats per minute  - Increase blood pressure by 5 to 10 mmHg  - Possibly cause sweating, nausea, and diarrhea  - Stimulate memory and alertness; people who use tobacco often depend on it to help them accomplish certain tasks and perform well    Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal appear within 2 to 3 hours after you last use tobacco. People who smoked the longest or smoked a greater number of cigarettes each day are more likely to have withdrawal symptoms. For those who are quitting, symptoms peak about 2 to 3 days later. Common symptoms include:  - Intense craving for nicotine  - Anxiety  - Depression  - Drowsiness or trouble sleeping  - Bad dreams and nightmares  - Feeling tense, restless, or frustrated  - Headaches  - Increased appetite and weight gain  - Problems concentrating    You may notice some or all of these symptoms when switching from regular to low-nicotine cigarettes or reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke.

Treatment : It is hard to stop smoking or using smokeless tobacco, but anyone can do it. There are many ways to quit smoking.  There are also resources to help you quit. Family members, friends, and co-workers may be supportive. Quitting tobacco is hard if you are trying to do it alone.  To be successful, you must really want to quit. Most people who have quit smoking were unsuccessful at least once in the past. Try not to view past attempts as failures. See them as learning experiences.  Most smokers find it hard to break all the habits they have created around smoking.  A smoking cessation program may improve your chance for success. These programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations.  Nicotine replacement therapy may also be helpful. It involves the use of products that provide low doses of nicotine, but none of the toxins found in smoke. Nicotine replacement comes in the form of:   - Gum  - Inhalers  - Throat lozenges  - Nasal spray  - Skin patches    You can buy many types of nicotine replacement without a prescription. The goal is to relieve cravings for nicotine and ease your withdrawal symptoms.  Health experts warn that e-cigarettes are not a replacement therapy for cigarette smoking. It is not known exactly how much nicotine is in e-cigarette cartridges, because information on labels is often wrong.  Your health care provider can also prescribe other types of medicines to help you quit and prevent you from starting again.

Support Groups : Your provider can refer you to stop smoking programs. These are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations.

Outlook (Prognosis) : People who are trying to quit smoking often become discouraged when they do not succeed at first. Research shows that the more times you try, the more likely you are to succeed. If you start smoking again after you have tried to quit, do not give up. Look at what worked or did not work, think of new ways to quit smoking, and try again.

Possible Complications : There are many more reasons to quit using tobacco. Knowing the serious health risks from tobacco may help motivate you to quit. Tobacco and related chemicals can increase your risk of serious health problems such as cancer, lung disease, and heart attack.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : See your health care provider if you wish to stop smoking, or have already done so and are having withdrawal symptoms. Your provider can help recommend treatments.)

ADAM_0000237_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Ankle arthroscopy (Also called: Ankle surgery; Arthroscopy - ankle; Surgery - ankle - arthroscopy; Surgery - ankle - arthroscopic)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007584.htm
Answer: Summary : Ankle arthroscopy is surgery that uses a tiny camera and surgical tools to examine or repair the tissues inside or around your ankle. The camera is called an arthroscope. The procedure allows the doctor to detect problems and make repairs to your ankle without making larger cuts in the skin and tissue. This means that you may have less pain and recover more quickly than open surgery.

Description : You will likely receive general anesthesia before this surgery. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or, you will have regional anesthesia. Your leg and ankle area will be numbed so that you do not feel any pain. If you receive regional anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to make you very sleepy during the operation.  During the procedure, the surgeon does the following:  - Inserts the arthroscope into your ankle through a small incision. The scope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view the inside of your ankle.  - Inspects all the tissues of your ankle. These tissues include cartilage, bones, tendons, and ligaments.  - Repairs any damaged tissues. To do this, your surgeon makes 1 to 3 more small incisions and inserts other instruments through them. A tear in a muscle, tendon, or cartilage is fixed. Any damaged tissue is removed.    At the end of the surgery, the incisions will be closed with stitches and covered with a dressing (bandage). Most surgeons take pictures from the video monitor during the procedure to show you what they found and what repairs they made.  Your surgeon may need to do open surgery if there is a lot of damage. Open surgery means you will have a large incision so that the surgeon can get directly to your bones and tissues.

Why the Procedure is Performed : Arthroscopy may be recommended for these ankle problems:  - Ankle pain: Arthroscopy allows the surgeon to explore what is causing your ankle pain.  - Ligament tears: A ligament is a band of tissue that connects bone to bone. Several ligaments in the ankle help keep it stable and allow it to move. Torn ligaments can be repaired with this type of surgery.  - Ankle impingement: Tissues in your ankle can become swollen and sore from overuse. This makes it hard to move the joint. Arthroscopy can remove the tissue so you can move your joint.  - Scar tissue: This can form after an injury to the ankle. This surgery can remove scar tissue.  - Arthritis: Arthroscopy can be used to help reduce pain and improve movement.  - Cartilage injuries: This surgery can be used to diagnose or repair cartilage and bone injuries.  - Loose fragments: These are pieces of bone or cartilage inside the ankle that can cause the joint to lock up. During arthroscopy these fragments can be removed.

Risks : Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:  - Allergic reactions to medicines  - Breathing problems  - Bleeding, blood clot, or infection    Risks of ankle arthroscopy are:  - Failure of surgery to relieve symptoms  - Failure of repair to heal  - Weakness of the ankle  - Injury to tendon, blood vessel, or nerve

Before the Procedure : Tell your health care provider what medicines you are taking. This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.  During the 2 weeks before your surgery:  - You may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), and other medicines.  - Ask your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.  - If you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical conditions, your surgeon will ask you to see your doctor who treats you for these conditions.  - Tell your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day.  - If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your health care provider or nurse for help. Smoking can slow wound and bone healing.  - Tell your doctor about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you may have before your surgery.    On the day of surgery:  - Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking before the procedure.  - Take the medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Follow instructions about when to arrive at the hospital. Arrive on time.

After the Procedure : - You can usually go home the same day after you recover from the anesthesia. You should have someone drive you home.  - Keep your ankle elevated above your heart for 2 to 3 days to help reduce swelling and pain. You can also apply cold packs to reduce swelling.  - Keep your bandage clean and dry. Follow instructions for how to change the dressing.  - You can take pain relievers, if needed, as long as your doctor says it is safe to do so.  - You will need to use a walker or crutches and keep weight off your foot.

Outlook (Prognosis) : Arthroscopy uses small cuts in the skin. Compared to regular surgery, you may have:  - Less pain and stiffness  - Fewer complications  - Faster recovery    The small cuts will heal quickly, and you may be able to resume your normal activities in a few days. But, if a lot of tissue in your ankle had to be repaired, it may take several weeks to heal. How quickly you heal depends on how complicated the surgery was.  You may be shown how to do gentle exercises as you heal. Or, your doctor may recommend that you see a physical therapist to help you regain the full use of your ankle.)

Answer: Ankle pain is often due to an ankle sprain.  - An ankle sprain is an injury to the ligaments, which connect bones to one another.  - In most cases, the ankle is twisted inward, causing small tears in the ligaments. The tearing leads to swelling and bruising, making it difficult to bear weight on the joint.    In addition to ankle sprains, ankle pain can be caused by:  - Damage or swelling of tendons (which join muscles to bone) or cartilage (which cushions joints)  - Infection in the ankle joint  - Osteoarthritis, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter syndrome, and other types of arthritis    Problems in areas near the ankle that can cause you to feel pain in the ankle include:  - Blockage of blood vessels in the leg  - Heel pain or injuries  - Nerve injuries (such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or sciatica))

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007254.htm
Answer: Ankle replacement surgery is most often done while you are under general anesthesia. This means you will be asleep and not feel the pain.   You may have spinal anesthesia. You can be awake but will not feel anything below your waist. If you have spinal anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to help you relax during the operation.   Your surgeon will make a surgical cut in the front of your ankle to expose the ankle joint. Your surgeon will then gently push the tendons, nerves, and blood vessels to the side. After this:   - Your surgeon will remove the damaged bone and cartilage.    Your surgeon will replace the damaged part of:  - The lower end of your shin bone (tibia)  - The top of your foot bone (talus) that the leg bones rest on  - The metal parts of the new artificial joint are then attached to the cut bony surfaces. A special glue/bone cement may be used to hold them in place.  - A piece of plastic is then inserted between the two metal parts.  - Screws maybe placed to stabilize your ankle.   The surgeon will put the tendons back into place and close the wound with sutures (stitches). You may need to wear a splint, cast, or brace for a while to keep the ankle from moving.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000869.htm
Answer: There are 2 types of contact dermatitis.  Irritant dermatitis: This is the most common type. It can be by contact with acids, alkaline materials such as soaps and detergents, fabric softeners, solvents, or other chemicals. The reaction most often looks like a burn. It is not caused by an allergy, but rather the skin's reaction to a very irritating substance.  Other materials that may irritate your skin include:  - Cement  - Hair dyes  - Long-term exposure to wet diapers  - Pesticides or weed killers  - Rubber gloves  - Shampoos    Allergic contact dermatitis: This form of the condition occurs when your skin comes in contact with a substance that causes you to have an allergic reaction.   Common allergens include:  - Adhesives, including those used for false eyelashes or toupees  - Antibiotics, such as neomycin rubbed on the surface of the skin  - Balsam of Peru (used in many personal products and cosmetics, as well as in many foods and drinks)  - Fabrics and clothing  - Fragrances in perfumes, cosmetics, soaps, and moisturizers  - Nail polish, hair dyes, and permanent wave solutions  - Nickel or other metals (found in jewelry, watch straps, metal zips, bra hooks, buttons, pocketknives, lipstick holders, and powder compacts)  - Poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and other plants  - Rubber or latex gloves or shoes    You will not have a reaction to a substance when you are first exposed to the substance. However, you will form a reaction after future exposures. You may become more sensitive and develop a reaction if you use it regularly. The reaction most often occurs 24 to 48 hours after the exposure.   Some products cause a reaction only when the skin is also exposed to sunlight (photosensitivity). These include:  - Shaving lotions  - Sunscreens  - Sulfa ointments  - Some perfumes  - Coal tar products  - Oil from the skin of a lime    A few airborne allergens, such as ragweed or insecticide spray, can also cause contact dermatitis.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000869.htm
Answer: Symptoms vary depending on the cause and whether the dermatitis is due to an allergic reaction or an irritant. The same person may also have different symptoms over time.  Allergic reactions may occur suddenly, or develop after months of exposure.   Contact dermatitis often occurs on the hands. Hair products, cosmetics, and perfumes can lead to skin reactions on the face, head, and neck. Jewelry can also cause skin problems in the area under it.  Itching is a common symptom. In the case of an allergic dermatitis, itching can be severe.   You may have red, streaky, or patchy rash where the substance touched the skin. The allergic reaction is often delayed so that the rash may not appear until 24 to 48 hours after exposure.   The rash may:  - Have red bumps that may form moist, weeping blisters  - Feel warm and tender  - Ooze, drain, or crust  - Become scaly, raw, or thickened    Dermatitis caused by an irritant may also cause burning or pain as well as itching. Irritant dermatitis often shows as dry, red, and rough skin. Cuts (fissures) may form on the hands. Skin may become inflamed with long-term exposure.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000869.htm
Answer: Your health care provider will make the diagnosis based on how the skin looks and by asking questions about substances you may have come in contact with.  Allergy testing with skin patches (called patch testing) may determine what is causing the reaction. Patch testing is used for certain people who have long-term or repeated contact dermatitis. It requires 3 office visits and must be done by a provider with the skill to interpret the results correctly.   - On the first visit, small patches of possible allergens are applied to the skin. These patches are removed 48 hours later to see if a reaction has occurred.  - A third visit, about 2 days later, is done to look for any delayed reaction.  - If you have already tested a material on a small area of your skin and noticed a reaction, you should bring the material with you.    Other tests may be used to rule out other possible causes, including skin lesion biopsy or culture of the skin lesion.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000869.htm
Answer: Your doctor will recommend treatment based on what is causing the problem. In some cases, the best treatment is to do nothing to the area.  Often, treatment includes washing the area with a lot of water to get rid of any traces of the irritant that are still on the skin. You should avoid further exposure to the substance.  Emollients or moisturizers help keep the skin moist, and also help skin repair itself. They protect the skin from becoming inflamed again. They are a key part of preventing and treating contact dermatitis.  Topical corticosteroids are medicines used to treat eczema.  - Topical means you place it on the skin. You will be prescribed a cream or ointment. Topical corticosteroids may also be called topical steroids or topical cortisones.  - DO NOT use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor advises you to use it.    Your provider may also prescribe other creams or ointments, such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus, to use on the skin.  In severe cases, you may need to take corticosteroid pills. Your provider will start you on a high dose and your dose will be slowly reduced over about 12 days. You may also receive a corticosteroid shot.  Wet dressings and soothing anti-itch (antipruritic) lotions may be recommended to reduce other symptoms.)

Answer: Contact dermatitis clears up without complications in 2 or 3 weeks in most cases. However, it may return if the substance that caused it cannot be found or avoided.   You may need to change your job or job habits if the disorder is caused by exposure at work.  Sometimes, the allergen causing the reaction is never identified.)

Answer: Summary : Vegetables are an important part of a well-balanced diet. Many people wonder if frozen and canned vegetables are as healthy for you as fresh vegetables.  Overall, vegetables fresh from the farm or just picked are healthier than frozen or canned ones. But frozen and canned vegetables can still be a good choice. They need to be canned or frozen right after being harvested, when they still have all of their healthy nutrients.  Also, keep in mind how much salt is added to canned vegetables.

Medical schools, professional health organizations, and hospitals often provide online health content.  - Look for "".gov,"" "".edu,"" or "".org"" in the web address. A "".gov"" address means the site is run by a government agency. A "".edu"" address indicates an educational institution. And a "".org"" address often means a professional organization runs the site. A "".com"" address means a for-profit company runs the site. It may still have some good information, but the content may be biased.  - Find out who wrote or reviewed the content. Look for health care providers such as doctors (MDs), nurses (RNs), or other licensed health professionals. Also look for an editorial policy. This policy can tell you where the site gets its content or how it is created.  - Look for scientific references. Content is more reliable if it is based on scientific studies. Professional journals are good references. These include the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and the New England Journal of Medicine. Recent editions of medical textbooks are also good references.  - Look for the contact information on the site. You should be able to reach the site sponsor by telephone, email, or a mailing address.  - No matter where you find the information, check how old the content is. Even trusted sites may have out-of-date information archived. Look for content that is no more than 2 to 3 years old. Individual pages may have a date at the bottom that says when it was last updated. Or the home page may have such a date.  - Beware of chat rooms and discussion groups. The content in these forums is typically not reviewed or regulated. Plus it may come from people who are not experts, or who are trying to sell something.  - DO NOT rely on just one website. Compare the information you find on a site with content from other sites. Make sure other sites can back up the information you have found.

Things to Keep in Mind : While searching for health information online, use common sense and be wary.  - If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Beware of quick-fix cures. And remember that a money-back guarantee does not mean that something works.  - As with any kind of website, it is important to be careful with your personal information. DO NOT give out your Social Security number. Before you buy anything, be sure that the site has a secure server. This will help protect your credit card information. You can tell by looking in the box near the top of the screen that cites the web address. At the start of the web address, look for ""https"".  - Personal stories are not scientific fact. Just because someone claims that their personal health story is true, it does not mean that it is. But even if it is true, the same treatment may not apply to your case. Only your health care provider can help you find the care that is best for you.

Where to Start : Here are a few high-quality resources to get you started.  - American Heart.org -- www.americanheart.org: Information on heart disease and ways to prevent disease. From the American Heart Association.  - Diabetes.org -- www.diabetes.org: Information on diabetes and ways to prevent, manage, and treat the disease. From the American Diabetes Association.  - Familydoctor.org -- familydoctor.org: General health information for families. Produced by the American Academy of Family Physicians.  - Healthfinder.gov -- www.healthfinder.gov: General health information. Produced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  - HealthyChildren.org -- www.HealthyChildren.org: Information on children's health. From the American Academy of Pediatrics.  - MedlinePlus -- www.medlineplus.gov: General health information. Produced by the National Library of Medicine as part of the National Institutes of Health.  - NIHSeniorHealth.gov -- www.nihseniorhealth.gov: Health information for older adults. From the National Institutes of Health.

When to Call the Doctor : It is great that you are seeking information to help you manage your health. But keep in mind that online health information can never replace a talk with your health care provider. Talk to your provider if you have questions about your health, your treatment, or anything you read online. It can be helpful to print out the articles you have read and bring them with you to your appointment.)

CDC_0000054_Sec7.txt,"Question: how can botulism be prevented?
URL: http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/botulism/
Answer: Many cases of botulism are preventable. Foodborne botulism has often been from home-canned foods with low acid content, such as asparagus, green beans, beets and corn and is caused by failure to follow proper canning methods. However, seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade, with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture, at retail, or by consumers; some examples are chopped garlic in oil, canned cheese sauce, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice, and baked potatoes wrapped in foil. In Alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods. Persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods, and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners/cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the US Department of Agriculture. Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs. Most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust.  The bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.  Honey can contain the bacteria that causes infant botulism so, children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey. Honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and older.)

CDC_0000212_Sec3.txt,"Question: how can hps be prevented for Hantavirus ?
URL: http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/
Answer: Eliminate or minimize contact with rodents in your home, workplace, or campsite. If rodents don't find that where you are is a good place for them to be, then you're less likely to come into contact with them. Seal up holes and gaps in your home or garage. Place traps in and around your home to decrease rodent infestation. Clean up any easy-to-get food.
  
Recent research results show that many people who became ill with HPS developed the disease after having been in frequent contact with rodents and/or their droppings around a home or a workplace. On the other hand, many people who became ill reported that they had not seen rodents or rodent droppings at all. Therefore, if you live in an area where the carrier rodents are known to live, try to keep your home, vacation place, workplace, or campsite clean.
  
For more information on how you can prevent rodent infestations, the following information is available on the CDC Rodents site:)

Answer: On this Page General Information about VISA/VRSA What is Staphylococcus aureus? How do VISA and VRSA get their names? What should a patient do if they suspect they have a Staph, MRSA, VISA, or VRSA infection? Are VISA and VRSA infections treatable? How can the spread of VISA and VRSA be prevented? What should a person do if a family member or close friend has VISA or VRSA? What is CDC doing to address VISA and VRSA? Recommendations and Guidelines General Information about VISA/VRSA For more images of this bacterium, search the Public Health Image Library Vancomycin [van−kō−mī−sin]-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus [staff−u−lu−kaw−kus  aw−ree−us] (also called VISA) and Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also called VRSA) are specific types of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. However, as of October 2010, all VISA and VRSA isolates have been susceptible to other Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Persons who develop this type of staph infection may have underlying health conditions (such as diabetes and kidney disease), tubes going into their bodies (such as catheters), previous infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and recent exposure to vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents. What is Staphylococcus aureus? Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of about 30% of individuals. Most of the time, staph does not cause any harm. These infections can look like pimples, boils, or other skin conditions and most are able to be treated. Sometimes staph bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause serious infections which can be fatal, including: Bacteremia or sepsis when bacteria spread to the bloodstream usually as a result of using catheters or having surgery. Pneumonia which predominantly affects people with underlying lung disease including those on mechanical ventilators. Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) which can lead to heart failure. Osteomyelitis (bone infection) which can be caused by staph bacteria traveling in the bloodstream or put there by direct contact such as following trauma (puncture wound of foot or intravenous (IV) drug abuse). Top of page How do VISA and VRSA get their names? Staph bacteria are classified as VISA or VRSA based on laboratory tests. Laboratories perform tests to determine if staph bacteria are resistant to antimicrobial agents that might be used for treatment of infections. For vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents, laboratories determine how much of the agent it requires to inhibit the growth of the organism in a test tube. The result of the test is usually expressed as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or the minimum amount of antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial growth in the test tube. Therefore, staph bacteria are classified as VISA if the MIC for vancomycin is 4-8µg/ml, and classified as VRSA if the vancomycin MIC is ≥16µg/ml. Top of page What should a patient do if they suspect they have a staph, MRSA, VISA, or VRSA infection? See a healthcare provider. Top of page Are VISA and VRSA infections treatable? Yes. As of October 2010, all VISA and VRSA isolates have been susceptible to several Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Top of page How can the spread of VISA and VRSA be prevented? Use of appropriate infection control practices (such as wearing gloves before and after contact with infectious body substances and adherence to hand hygiene) by healthcare personnel can reduce the spread of VISA and VRSA. Top of page What should a person do if a family member or close friend has VISA or VRSA? VISA and VRSA are types of antibiotic-resistant staph bacteria. Therefore, as with all staph bacteria, spread occurs among people having close physical contact with infected patients or contaminated material, such as bandages. Persons having close physical contact with infected patients while they are outside of the healthcare setting should: (1) keep their hands clean by washing thoroughly with soap and water, and (2) avoid contact with other people's wounds or material contaminated from wounds. If they go to the hospital to visit a friend or family member who is infected with VISA or VRSA , they must follow the hospital's recommended precautions. Top of page What is CDC doing to address VISA and VRSA? In addition to providing guidance for clinicians and infection control personnel, CDC is also working with state and local health agencies, healthcare facilities, and clinical microbiology laboratories to ensure that laboratories are using proper methods to detect VISA and VRSA. Top of page Recommendations and Guidelines CDC issued a Clinical Reminder, in 2010, which serves as a reminder about the important role of clinical laboratories in the diagnosis of VRSA cases to ensure prompt recognition, isolation, and management by infection control personnel.

CDC_0000424_Sec6.txt,"Question: how can patients prevent the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci?
URL: http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/organisms/vre/vre.html
Answer: On this Page General Information What is vancomycin-resistant enterococci? What types of infections does vancomycin-resistant enterococci cause? Are certain people at risk of getting vancomycin-resistant enterococci? What is the treatment for vancomycin-resistant enterococci? How is vancomycin-resistant enterococci spread? How can patients prevent the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci? What should a patient do if they think they have vancomycin-resistant enterococci? Recommendations and Guidelines General Information For more images of this bacterium, search the Public Health Image Library What is vancomycin-resistant enterococci? Enteroccocci are bacteria that are normally present in the human intestines and in the female genital tract and are often found in the environment. These bacteria can sometimes cause infections. Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is used to treat some drug-resistant infections caused by enterococci. In some instances, enterococci have become resistant to this drug and thus are called vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Most VRE infections occur in hospitals. Top of page What types of infections does VRE cause? VRE can live in the human intestines and female genital tract without causing disease (often called colonization). However, sometimes it can cause infections of the urinary tract, the bloodstream, or of wounds associated with catheters or surgical procedures. Top of page Are certain people at risk of getting VRE? The following persons are at increased risk becoming infected with VRE: People who have been previously treated with the antibiotic vancomycin or other antibiotics for long periods of time. People who are hospitalized, particularly when they receive antibiotic treatment for long periods of time. People with weakened immune systems such as patients in intensive care units, or in cancer or transplant wards. People who have undergone surgical procedures such as abdominal or chest surgery. People with medical devices that stay in for some time such as urinary catheters or central intravenous (IV) catheters. People who are colonized with VRE. Top of page What is the treatment for VRE? People with colonized VRE (bacteria are present, but have no symptoms of an infection)  do not need treatment. Most VRE infections can be treated with antibiotics other than vancomycin. Laboratory testing of the VRE can determine which antibiotics will work. For people who get VRE infections in their bladder and have urinary catheters, removal of the catheter when it is no longer needed can also help get rid of the infection. Top of page How is VRE spread? VRE is often passed from person to person by the contaminated hands of caregivers. VRE can get onto a caregiver's hands after they have contact with other people with VRE or after contact with contaminated surfaces. VRE can also be spread directly to people after they touch surfaces that are contaminated with VRE. VRE is not spread through the air by coughing or sneezing. Top of page How can patients prevent the spread of VRE? If a patient or someone in their household has VRE, the following are some things they can do to prevent the spread of VRE: Keep their hands clean. Always wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom and before preparing food. Clean their hands after contact with persons who have VRE. Wash with soap and water (particularly when visibly soiled) or use alcohol-based hand rubs. Frequently clean areas of the home, such as bathrooms, that may become contaminated with VRE. Wear gloves if hands may come in contact with body fluids that may contain VRE, such as stool or bandages from infected wounds. Always wash their hands after removing gloves. If someone has VRE, be sure to tell healthcare providers so that they are aware of the infection. Healthcare facilities use special precautions to help prevent the spread of VRE to others. Top of page What should patients do if they think they have vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)? Anyone who thinks they have VRE must talk with their healthcare provider.

ADAM_0001735_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Giving an insulin injection
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000660.htm
Answer: Summary : To give an insulin injection, you need to fill the right syringe with the right amount of medicine, decide where to give the injection, and know how to give the injection.

Getting Ready : - Your health care provider will teach you all of these steps, watch you practice, and answer your questions. You may take notes to remember the details.  - Know the name and dose of each medicine to give. The type of insulin should match the type of syringe: U-100 or U-500. Because U-500 syringes may be difficult to find, your health care provider may give you instructions for using U-500 insulin with U-100 syringes.  - Some types of insulin can be mixed with each other in one syringe, but not all. Consult with your provider or pharmacist about this.  - Always use the same brands and types of supplies. DO NOT use expired insulin.  - Insulin should be given at room temperature. If you had it in the refrigerator or cooler bag, take it out 30 minutes before the injection. Once you have started using a vial of insulin, it can be kept at room temperature for a month.  - Gather your supplies: insulin, needles, syringes, alcohol wipes, and a container for used needles and syringes.

Filling the Syringe - One Type of Insulin : - Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them well.  - Check the insulin bottle label. Make sure it is the right insulin. Make sure it is not expired.  - The insulin should not have any clumps on the sides of the bottle. If it does, throw it out and get another bottle.  - Intermediate-acting insulin is cloudy, and must be rolled between your hands to mix it. DO NOT shake the bottle. This can make the insulin clump.  - Clear insulin does not need to be mixed.  - If the insulin vial has a plastic cover, take it off. Wipe the top of the bottle with an alcohol wipe. Let it dry. DO NOT blow on it.  - Know the dose of insulin you want. Take the cap off the needle, being careful not to touch the needle to keep it sterile. Pull back the plunger of the syringe to put as much air in the syringe as the dose of medicine you want.  - Put the needle into and through the rubber top of the insulin bottle. Push the plunger so the air goes into the bottle.  - Keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down.  - With the tip of the needle in the liquid, pull back on the plunger to get the right dose of insulin into the syringe.  - Check the syringe for air bubbles. If there are bubbles, hold both the bottle and syringe in one hand, and tap the syringe with your other hand. The bubbles will float to the top. Push the bubbles back into the insulin bottle, then pull back to get the right dose.  - When there are no bubbles, take the syringe out of the bottle. Put the syringe down carefully so the needle does not touch anything.

Filling the Syringe - Two Types of Insulin : - Never mix two types of insulin in one syringe unless you are told to do this. You will also be told which insulin to draw up first. Always do it in that order.  - Your doctor will tell you how much of each insulin you will need. Add these two numbers together. This is the amount of insulin you should have in the syringe before injecting it.  - Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them well.  - Check the insulin bottle label. Make sure it is the right insulin.  - The insulin should not have any clumps on the sides of the bottle. If it does, throw it out and get another bottle.  - Intermediate-acting insulin is cloudy, and must be rolled between your hands to mix it. DO NOT shake the bottle. This can make the insulin clump.  - Clear insulin does not need to be mixed.  - If the vial has a plastic cover, take it off. Wipe the top of the bottle with an alcohol wipe. Let it dry. DO NOT blow on it.  - Know the dose of each insulin you want. Take the cap off the needle, being careful not to touch the needle to keep it sterile. Pull back the plunger of the syringe to put as much air in the syringe as the dose of the longer-acting insulin.  - Put the needle into the rubber top of that insulin bottle. Push the plunger so the air goes into the bottle. Remove the needle from the bottle.  - Put the air in the short-acting insulin bottle the same way as the previous two steps above.  - Keep the needle in the short-acting bottle and turn the bottle upside down.  - With the tip of the needle in the liquid, pull back on the plunger to get the right dose of insulin into the syringe.  - Check the syringe for air bubbles. If there are bubbles, hold both the bottle and syringe in one hand, and tap the syringe with your other hand. The bubbles will float to the top. Push the bubbles back into the insulin bottle, then pull back to get the right dose.  - When there are no bubbles, take the syringe out of the bottle. Look at it again to make sure you have the right dose.  - Put the needle into the rubber top of the longer-acting insulin bottle.  - Turn the bottle upside down. With the tip of the needle in the liquid, slowly pull back on the plunger to exactly the right dose of long-acting insulin. DO NOT draw extra insulin in the syringe, since you should not push the mixed insulin back into the bottle.  - Check the syringe for air bubbles. If there are bubbles, hold both the bottle and syringe in one hand, and tap the syringe with your other hand. The bubbles will float to the top. Remove the needle from the bottle before you push out the air.  - Make sure you have the right total dose of insulin. Put the syringe down carefully so the needle does not touch anything.

Giving the Injection : Choose where to give the injection. Keep a chart of places you have used, so you do not put the insulin in the same place all the time. Ask your doctor for a chart.  - Keep your shots 1 inch away from scars and 2 inches away from your navel.  - DO NOT put a shot in a spot that is bruised, swollen, or tender.    The site you choose for the injection should be clean and dry. If your skin is visibly dirty, clean it with soap and water. DO NOT use an alcohol wipe on your injection site.  The insulin needs to go into the fat layer under the skin.  - Pinch the skin and put the needle in at a 45 angle.  - If your tissues are thick enough, you may be able to inject straight up and down (90 angle). Check with your health care provider before doing this.  - Push the needle all the way into the skin. Let go of the pinched skin. Inject the insulin slowly and steadily until it is all in.  - Leave the syringe in place for 5 seconds after injecting.    Pull the needle out at the same angle it went in. Put the syringe down. There is no need to recap it. If insulin tends to leak from your injection site, press the injection site for a few seconds after the injection. If this happens often, check with your health care provider.  Place the needle and syringe in a safe hard container. Close the container, and keep it safely away from children and animals. Never reuse needles or syringes.

Storing Your Insulin and Supplies : Ask your pharmacist how to store your insulin so it does not go bad.)

MPlusDrugs_0000627_Sec1.txt,"Question: Who should get Insulin Injection and why is it prescribed ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682611.html
Answer: Insulin injection is used to control blood sugar in people who have type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not make insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or in people who have type 2 diabetes (condition in which the blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally) that cannot be controlled with oral medications alone. Insulin injection is in a class of medications called hormones. Insulin injection is used to take the place of insulin that is normally produced by the body. It works by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar. All of the types of insulin that are available work in this way. The types of insulin differ only in how quickly they begin to work and how long they continue to control blood sugar.  Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a697021.html
Answer: Insulin lispro is used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). It is also used to treat people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) who need insulin to control their diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin lispro is always used with another type of insulin, unless it is used in an external insulin pump. In patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin lispro may be used with another type of insulin or with oral medication(s) for diabetes. Insulin lispro is a short-acting, man-made version of human insulin. Insulin lispro works by replacing the insulin that is normally produced by the body and by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar.  Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems.

ADAM_0001478_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Exercise and activity - children
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000353.htm
Answer: Summary : Children should have many chances to play, run, bike, and play sports during the day. They should get 60 minutes of moderate activity every day.  Moderate activity makes your breathing and heartbeats speed up. Some examples are:  - Walking fast  - Playing chase or tag  - Playing basketball and most other organized sports (such as soccer, swimming, and dancing)    Younger children cannot stick with the same activity as long as an older child. They may be active for only 10 to 15 minutes at a time. The goal is still to get 60 minutes of activity every day.

Why Exercise? : Children who exercise:  - Feel better about themselves  - Are more physically fit  - Have more energy    Other benefits of exercise for children are:   - A lower risk of heart disease and diabetes  - Healthy bone and muscle growth  - Staying at a healthy weight

Getting Started : Some kids enjoy being outside and active. Others would rather stay inside and play video games or watch TV. If your child does not like sports or physical activity, look for ways to motivate him. These ideas may help children become more active.  - Let children know that being active will give them more energy, make their bodies stronger, and make them feel better about themselves.  - Give encouragement for physical activity and help children believe they can do it.  - Be their role model. Start being more active if you are not already active yourself.  - Make walking a part of your family's daily routine. Get good walking shoes and rain jackets for the wet days. DO NOT let rain stop you.  - Go for walks together after dinner, before turning on the TV or playing computer games.  - Take your family to community centers or parks where there are playgrounds, ball fields, basketball courts, and walking paths. It is easier to be active when people around you are active.

Find a Good Match : Organized sports and daily activities are good ways for your child to get exercise. You will have better success if you select activities that fit your child's preferences and abilities.  - Individual activities include swimming, running, skiing, or biking.  - Group sports are another option, such as soccer, football, basketball, karate, or tennis.  - Choose an exercise that works well for your child's age. A 6-year-old may play outside with other kids, while a 16-year-old may prefer to run at a track.    Daily activities can use as much, or more, energy than some organized sports. Some everyday things your child can do to be active include:  - Walk or bike to school.  - Take the stairs instead of the elevator.  - Ride a bike with family or friends.  - Take the dog for a walk.  - Play outside. Shoot a basketball or kick and throw a ball around, for instance.  - Play in the water, at a local pool, in a water sprinkler, or splashing in puddles.  - Dance to music.  - Skate, ice-skate, skate-board, or roller-skate.  - Do household chores. Sweep, mop, vacuum, or load the dishwasher.  - Take a family walk or hike.  - Play computer games that involve moving your whole body.  - Rake leaves and jump in the piles before bagging them up.  - Mow the lawn.  - Weed the garden.)

ADAM_0002187_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Informed consent - adults
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000445.htm
Answer: Summary : You have the right to help decide what medical care is best for you. By law, your health care providers must explain your health condition and treatment choices to you.   Informed consent means:   - You are informed. You have received information about your health condition and treatment options.  - You understand your health condition and treatment options.  - You are able to decide what health care treatment you want to receive and give your consent to receive it.    To obtain your informed consent, your provider may talk with you about the treatment. Then you will read a description of it and sign a form. This is written informed consent.   Or, your provider may explain a treatment to you. They will ask if you agree to have the treatment. Not all medical treatments require written informed consent.

What Treatments Need Informed Consent? : Medical procedures that require you to give written informed consent include:   - Most surgeries, even when they are not done in the hospital.  - Other advanced or complex medical tests and procedures, such as an endoscopy (placing a tube down your throat to look at the inside of your stomach) or a needle biopsy of the liver.  - Radiation or chemotherapy to treat cancer.  - Most vaccines.  - Some blood tests, such as HIV testing (need for written consent varies by state).

What Should Occur During the Informed Consent Process? : When asking for your informed consent, your doctor or other health care provider must explain:  - If treatment is necessary now or if it can wait  - Your health problem and the reason for the treatment  - What happens during the treatment  - The risks of the treatment and how likely they are to occur  - How likely the treatment is to work  - Other options for treating your health problem  - Unknown risks or possible side effects that may happen later on    You should have enough information to make a decision about your treatment. Your provider should also make sure you understand the information. One way a provider may do this is by asking you to repeat the information back in your own words.  If you would like more details about your treatment choices, ask your provider where to look. There are many trusted websites and other resources your provider can give you.

What is Your Role in the Informed Consent Process? : You are an important member of your health care team. You should ask questions about anything you do not understand. If you need your provider to explain something in a different way, ask them to do so.  You have the right to refuse treatment if you are able to understand your health condition, your treatment options, and the risks and benefits of each option. Your doctor or other health care provider may tell you they do not think this is the best choice for you. But, your providers should not try to force you to have a treatment you do not want to have.  It is important to be involved in the informed consent process. After all, you are the one who will receive the treatment if you give your consent.

Other Tips : Informed consent is not needed in an emergency when delayed treatment would be dangerous.  Some people are no longer able to make an informed decision, such as someone with advanced Alzheimer disease or someone in a coma. In both cases, the person would not be able to understand information to decide what medical care they want. In these types of situations, the provider would try to obtain informed consent for treatment from a surrogate, or substitute decision-maker.   Even when your provider does not ask for your written consent, you should still be told what tests or treatments are being done and why. For example:   - Before they have the test, men should know the pros, cons, and the reasons for a PSA blood test that screens for prostate cancer.  - Women should know the pros, cons, and the reasons for a Pap test, a mammogram, or other tests.  - Anyone who is being tested for an infection that occurs after sexual contact should be told about the test and why they are being tested.)

GHR_0000112_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome ? (Also called: cutis gyrata syndrome of Beare and Stevenson; cutis gyrata syndrome of Beare-Stevenson)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/beare-stevenson-cutis-gyrata-syndrome
Answer: Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by skin abnormalities and the premature fusion of certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis). This early fusion prevents the skull from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face.  Many of the characteristic facial features of Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome result from the premature fusion of the skull bones. The head is unable to grow normally, which leads to a cloverleaf-shaped skull, wide-set and bulging eyes, ear abnormalities, and an underdeveloped upper jaw. Early fusion of the skull bones also affects the growth of the brain, causing delayed development and intellectual disability.  A skin abnormality called cutis gyrata is also characteristic of this disorder. The skin has a furrowed and wrinkled appearance, particularly on the face, near the ears, and on the palms and soles of the feet. Additionally, thick, dark, velvety areas of skin (acanthosis nigricans) are sometimes found on the hands and feet and in the genital region.  Additional signs and symptoms of Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome can include a blockage of the nasal passages (choanal atresia), overgrowth of the umbilical stump (tissue that normally falls off shortly after birth, leaving the belly button), and abnormalities of the genitalia and anus. The medical complications associated with this condition are often life-threatening in infancy or early childhood.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/beare-stevenson-cutis-gyrata-syndrome
Answer: Mutations in the FGFR2 gene cause Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome. This gene produces a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, which plays an important role in signaling a cell to respond to its environment, perhaps by dividing or maturing. A mutation in the FGFR2 gene alters the protein and promotes prolonged signaling, which is thought to interfere with skeletal and skin development.  Some individuals with Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome do not have identified mutations in the FGFR2 gene. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown.)

Answer: Summary : Birth weight is the first weight of your baby, taken just after he or she is born. A low birth weight is less than 5.5 pounds. A high birth weight is more than 8.8 pounds.    A low birth weight baby can be born too small, too early (premature), or both. This can happen for many different reasons. They include health problems in the mother, genetic factors, problems with the placenta and substance abuse by the mother.    Some low birth weight babies may be more at risk for certain health problems. Some may become sick in the first days of life or develop infections. Others may suffer from longer-term problems such as delayed motor and social development or learning disabilities.    High birth weight babies are often big because the parents are big, or the mother has diabetes during pregnancy.

Answer: Summary : Keeping a healthy weight is crucial. If you are underweight, overweight, or obese, you may have a higher risk of certain health problems.    About two thirds of adults in the U.S. are overweight or obese. Achieving a healthy weight can help you control your cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar. It might also help you prevent weight-related diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and some cancers.     Eating too much or not being physically active enough will make you overweight. To maintain your weight, the calories you eat must equal the energy you burn. To lose weight, you must use more calories than you eat. A weight-control strategy might include       - Choosing low-fat, low-calorie foods    - Eating smaller portions    - Drinking water instead of sugary drinks    - Being physically active       Eating extra calories within a well-balanced diet can help to add weight.

Answer: Plantar fasciitis occurs when the thick band of tissue on the bottom of the foot is overstretched or overused. This can be painful and make walking more difficult.   You are more likely to get plantar fasciitis if you:   - Have foot arch problems (both flat feet and high arches)  - Run long distances, downhill or on uneven surfaces  - Are obese or gain weight suddenly   - Have a tight Achilles tendon (the tendon connecting the calf muscles to the heel)  - Wear shoes with poor arch support or soft soles  - Change your activities   Plantar fasciitis is seen in both men and women. However, it most often affects active men ages 40 - 70. It is one of the most common orthopedic foot complaints.   Plantar fasciitis was commonly thought to be caused by a heel spur. However, research has found that this is not the case. On x-ray, heel spurs are seen in people with and without plantar fasciitis.)

ADAM_0001350_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about EGD discharge (Also called: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy - discharge; Upper endoscopy - discharge; Gastroscopy - discharge)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000898.htm
Answer: Summary : Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is a test to examine the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine.

When you are in the Hospital or Clinic : EGD is done with an endoscope. This is a flexible tube with a camera at the end.  During the procedure:  - You received medicine into a vein (IV).   - The scope was inserted through the esophagus (food pipe) to the stomach and first part of the small intestine (duodenum). Air was put through the endoscope to make it easier for the doctor to see.  - If needed, biopsies were taken through the endoscope. Biopsies are tissue samples that are looked at under the microscope.   The test lasted about 5 to 20 minutes.

Right After the Test : You will be taken to an area to recover right after the test. You may wake up and not remember how you got there.   The nurse will check your blood pressure and pulse. Your IV will be removed.  Your doctor will likely come talk to you and explain the results of the test.  - Ask to have this information written down, as you may not remember what you were told later on.  - Final results for any tissue biopsies that were done may take up to 1 to 3 weeks.

Getting Home : Medicines you were given can change the way you think and make it harder to remember for the rest of the day.  As a result, it is NOT safe for you to drive a car or find your own way home.   You will not be allowed to leave alone. You will need to ask a friend or family member to take you home.

Eating and Drinking : You will be asked to wait 30 minutes or more before drinking. Try small sips of water first. When you can do this easily, you can begin with small amounts of solid foods.   You may feel a little bloated from air pumped into your stomach, and burp or pass gas more often over the day.   If your throat is sore, gargle with warm, salty water.

The Rest of the day : DO NOT plan to return to work for the rest of the day. It is not safe to drive or handle tools or equipment.  You should also avoid making important work or legal decisions for the rest of the day, even if you believe your thinking is clear.  Keep an eye on the site where the IV fluids and medicines were given. Watch for any redness or swelling. You can place a warm wet washcloth over the area .  Ask your doctor which medicines or blood thinners you should start taking again and when to take them.  If you had a polyp removed, your provider may ask you to avoid lifting and other activities for up to 1 week.

When to Call the Doctor : Call your health care provider if you have:  - Black, tarry stools  - Red blood in your stool  - Vomiting that will not stop or vomiting blood  - Severe pain or cramps in your belly  - Chest pain  - Blood in your stool for more than 2 bowel movements  - Chills or fever over 101F (38.3C)  - No bowel movement for more than 2 days)

Treatment may involve:  - Blood transfusions  - Fluids and medicines through a vein  - Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). A thin tube with a camera on the end is passed through your mouth into your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine  - A tube is placed through your mouth into the stomach to drain the stomach contents (gastric lavage)    Once your condition is stable, you will have a physical exam and a detailed exam of your abdomen. You will also be asked questions about your symptoms, including:  - When did you first notice symptoms?  - Did you have black, tarry stools or red blood in the stools?  - Have you vomited blood?  - Did you vomit material that looks like coffee grounds?  - Do you have a history of peptic or duodenal ulcers?  - Have you ever had symptoms like this before?  - What other symptoms do you have?    Tests that may be done include:  - Abdominal CT scan  - Abdominal MRI scan  - Abdominal x-ray  - Angiography  - Bleeding scan (tagged red blood cell scan)  - Blood clotting tests  - Capsule endoscopy (camera pill that is swallowed to look at the small intestine)  - Colonoscopy  - Complete blood count (CBC), clotting tests, platelet count, and other laboratory tests  - Enteroscopy  - Sigmoidoscopy)

MPlusHealthTopics_0000392_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Gastrointestinal Bleeding ? (Also called: GI bleeding)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/gastrointestinalbleeding.html
Answer: Your digestive or gastrointestinal (GI) tract includes the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine or colon, rectum, and anus. Bleeding can come from any of these areas. The amount of bleeding can be so small that only a lab test can find it.     Signs of bleeding in the digestive tract depend where it is and how much bleeding there is.    Signs of bleeding in the upper digestive tract include       - Bright red blood in vomit    - Vomit that looks like coffee grounds    - Black or tarry stool    - Dark blood mixed with stool       Signs of bleeding in the lower digestive tract include       - Black or tarry stool    - Dark blood mixed with stool    - Stool mixed or coated with bright red blood       GI bleeding is not a disease, but a symptom of a disease. There are many possible causes of GI bleeding, including hemorrhoids, peptic ulcers, tears or inflammation in the esophagus, diverticulosis and diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, colonic polyps, or cancer in the colon, stomach or esophagus.    The test used most often to look for the cause of GI bleeding is called endoscopy. It uses a flexible instrument inserted through the mouth or rectum to view the inside of the GI tract. A type of endoscopy called colonoscopy looks at the large intestine.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)

ADAM_0000396_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Barium enema (Also called: Lower gastrointestinal series; Lower GI series)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003817.htm
Answer: Summary : Barium enema is a special x-ray of the large intestine, which includes the colon and rectum.

How the Test is Performed : This test may be done in a doctor's office or hospital radiology department. It is done after your colon is completely empty and clean. Your doctor will give you instructions for cleansing your colon.  During the test:  - You lie flat on your back on the x-ray table. An x-ray is taken.  - You then lie on your side. The health care provider gently inserts a well-lubricated tube (enema tube) into your rectum. The tube is connected to a bag that holds a liquid containing barium sulfate. This is a contrast material that highlights specific areas in the colon, creating a clear image.  - The barium flows into your colon. X-rays are taken. A small balloon at the tip of the enema tube may be inflated to help keep the barium inside your colon. The provider monitors the flow of the barium on an x-ray screen.  - Sometimes a small amount of air is delivered into the colon to expand it. This allows for even clearer images. This test is called a double contrast barium enema.  - You are asked to move into different positions. The table is slightly tipped to get different views. At certain times when the x-ray pictures are taken, you are told to hold your breath and be still for a few seconds so the images will not be blurry.  - The enema tube is removed after the x-rays are taken.  - You are then given a bedpan or helped to the toilet, so you can empty your bowels and remove as much of the barium as possible. Afterward, one or two more x-rays may be taken.

How to Prepare for the Test : Your bowels need to be completely empty for the exam. If they are not empty, the test may miss a problem in your large intestine.  You will be given instructions for cleansing your bowel. This is also called bowel preparation. Follow the instructions exactly. This ensures accurate results.  Your bowels are emptied using an enema or laxatives. 1 to 3 days before the test, you need to be on a clear liquid diet. Examples of clear liquids are:  - Clear coffee or tea  - Fat-free bouillon or broth  - Gelatin  - Sports drinks without added color  - Strained fruit juices  - Water

How the Test will Feel : When barium enters your colon, you may feel like you need to have a bowel movement. You may also have:   - A feeling of fullness  - Moderate to severe cramping  - General discomfort    Taking long, deep breaths may help you relax during the procedure.  It is normal for the stools to be white for a few days after this test. Drink extra fluids for 2 to 4 days. Ask your doctor about a laxative if you develop hard stools.

Why the Test is Performed : Barium enema is used to:   - Detect or screen for colon cancer  - Diagnose or monitor ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease  - Diagnose the cause of blood in stools, diarrhea, or very hard stools (constipation)    The barium enema test is used much less often than in the past. Colonoscopy is done more often now.

Normal Results : Barium should fill the colon evenly, showing normal bowel shape and position and no blockages.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal test results may be a sign of:  - Blockage of the large intestine (Hirschsprung disease)  - Colitis due to Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis  - Cancer in the colon or rectum  - Sliding of one part of the intestine into another (intussusception)  - Small growths that stick out of the lining of the colon, called polyps  - Small, bulging sacs or pouches of the inner lining of the intestine, called diverticulosis  - Twisted loop of the bowel (volvulus)

Risks : There is low radiation exposure. X-rays are monitored so that the smallest amount of radiation is used. Pregnant women and children are more sensitive to x-ray risks.  A rare, but serious, risk is a hole made in the colon (perforated colon) when the enema tube is inserted.)

Answer: Hepatocellular carcinoma accounts for most liver cancers. This type of cancer occurs more often in men than women. It is usually diagnosed in people age 50 or older.  Hepatocellular carcinoma is not the same as metastatic liver cancer, which starts in another organ (such as the breast or colon) and spreads to the liver.  In most cases, the cause of liver cancer is long-term damage and scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). Cirrhosis may be caused by:  - Alcohol abuse  - Autoimmune diseases of the liver  - Hepatitis B or C virus infection  - Inflammation of the liver that is long-term (chronic)  - Iron overload in the body (hemochromatosis)   People with hepatitis B or C are at high risk of liver cancer, even if theydo not develop cirrhosis.)

Three of the many important functions of the liver are:         - To filter harmful substances from the blood so they can be passed from the body in stools and urine.    - To make bile to help digest fats from food.     - To store glycogen (sugar), which the body uses for energy.           Liver cancer is rare in children and adolescents.
                
            	
                    There are different types of childhood liver cancer.
                    There are two main types of childhood liver cancer:         -  Hepatoblastoma: Hepatoblastoma is the most common type of childhood liver cancer. It usually affects children younger than 3 years of age.  In hepatoblastoma, the histology (how the cancer cells look under a microscope) affects the way the cancer is treated. The histology for hepatoblastoma may be one of the following:               - Pure fetal histology.      - Small cell undifferentiated histology.      - Non-pure fetal histology, non-small cell undifferentiated histology.              -  Hepatocellular carcinoma: Hepatocellular carcinoma usually affects older children and adolescents. It is more common in areas of Asia that have high rates of hepatitis infection than in the U.S.        The treatment of two less common types of childhood liver cancer is also discussed in this summary:          - Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver: This type of liver cancer usually occurs in children between 5 and 10 years of age. It often spreads all through the liver and/or to the lungs.    - Infantile choriocarcinoma of the liver is a very rare tumor that starts in the placenta and spreads to the fetus. The tumor is usually found during the first few months of life. Also, the mother of the child may be diagnosed with choriocarcinoma. Choriocarcinoma is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease and needs treatment. See the Gestational Trophoblastic Disease Treatment summary for information on the treatment of choriocarcinoma.         This summary is about the treatment of primary liver cancer (cancer that begins in the liver). Treatment of metastatic liver cancer, which is cancer that begins in other parts of the body and spreads to the liver, is not discussed in this summary. Primary liver cancer can occur in both adults and children. However, treatment for children is different than treatment for adults. See the PDQ summary on Adult Primary Liver Cancer Treatment for more information on the treatment of adults.)

ADAM_0001349_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about EGD - esophagogastroduodenoscopy (Also called: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy; Upper endoscopy; Gastroscopy)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003888.htm
Answer: Summary : Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is a test to examine the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine.

How the Test is Performed : EGD is done in a hospital or medical center. The procedure uses an endoscope. This is a flexible tube with a light and camera at the end.  The procedure is done as follows:  - You receive medicine into a vein to help you relax. You should feel no pain and not remember the procedure.  - A local anesthetic may be sprayed into your mouth to prevent you from coughing or gagging when the scope is inserted. A mouth guard is used to protect your teeth and the scope. Dentures must be removed before the procedure begins.  - You then lie on your left side.  - The scope is inserted through the esophagus (food pipe) to the stomach and duodenum. Air is put through the scope to make it easier for the doctor to see.  - The lining of the esophagus, stomach, and upper duodenum is examined. Biopsies can be taken through the scope. Biopsies are tissue samples that are looked at under the microscope.  - Different treatments may be done, such as stretching or widening a narrowed area of the esophagus.    After the test is finished, you will not be able to have food and liquid until your gag reflex returns (so you do not choke).  The test lasts about 5 to 20 minutes.

How to Prepare for the Test : You will not be able to eat anything for 6 to 12 hours before the test. Follow instructions about stopping aspirin and other blood-thinning medicines before the test.

How the Test will Feel : The anesthetic spray makes it hard to swallow. This wears off shortly after the procedure. The scope may make you gag.   You may feel gas and the movement of the scope in your abdomen. You will not be able to feel the biopsy. Because of sedation, you may not feel any discomfort and have no memory of the test.  You may feel bloated from the air that was put into your body. This feeling soon wears off.

Why the Test is Performed : EGD may be done if you have symptoms that are new, cannot be explained, or are not responding to treatment, such as:  - Black or tarry stools or vomiting blood  - Bringing food back up (regurgitation)  - Feeling full sooner than normal or after eating less than usual  - Feeling like food is stuck behind the breastbone  - Heartburn  - Low blood count (anemia) that cannot be explained  - Pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen  - Swallowing problems or pain with swallowing  - Weight loss that cannot be explained  - Nausea or vomiting that does not go away    Your doctor may also order this test if you:  - Have cirrhosis of the liver, to look for swollen veins (called varices) in the walls of the lower part of the esophagus, which may begin to bleed  - Have Crohn disease  - Need more follow-up or treatment for a condition that has been diagnosed    The test may also be used to take a piece of tissue for biopsy.

Normal Results : The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum should be smooth and of normal color. There should be no bleeding, growths, ulcers, or inflammation.

What Abnormal Results Mean : An abnormal EGD may be the result of:  - Celiac disease  - Esophageal rings  - Esophageal varices (swollen veins in the lining of the esophagus caused by liver cirrhosis)  - Esophagitis (lining of the esophagus becomes inflamed or swollen)  - Gastritis (lining of the stomach and duodenum is inflamed or swollen)  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (a condition in which food or liquid from the stomach leaks backwards into the esophagus)  - Hiatal hernia (a condition in which part of the stomach sticks up into the chest through an opening in the diaphragm)  - Mallory-Weiss syndrome (tear in the esophagus)  - Narrowing of the esophagus  - Tumors or cancer in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum (first part of small intestine)  - Ulcers, gastric (stomach) or duodenal (small intestine)

Risks : There is a small chance of a hole (perforation) in the stomach, duodenum, or esophagus from the scope moving through these areas. There is also a small risk of bleeding at the biopsy site.   You could have a reaction to the medicine used during the procedure, which could cause:  - Apnea (not breathing)  - Difficulty breathing (respiratory depression)  - Excessive sweating  - Low blood pressure (hypotension)  - Slow heartbeat (bradycardia)  - Spasm of the larynx (laryngospasm))

ADAM_0004097_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Upper GI and small bowel series (Also called: GI series; Barium swallow x-ray; Upper GI series)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003816.htm
Answer: Summary : An upper GI and small bowel series is a set of x-rays taken to examine the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine.  Barium enema is a related test.

How the Test is Performed : An upper GI and small bowel series is done in a health care office or hospital radiology department.  You may get an injection of a medicine that slows muscle movement in the small intestine. This makes it easier to see the structures of your organs on the x-rays.  Before the x-rays are taken, you must drink 16 to 20 ounces of a milkshake-like drink. The drink contains a substance called barium, which shows up well on x-rays.  An x-ray method called fluoroscopy tracks how the barium moves through your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. Pictures are taken while you sit or stand in different positions.   The test most often takes around 3 hours but can take as long as 6 hours to complete.  A GI series may include this test or a barium enema.

How to Prepare for the Test : You may have to change your diet for 2 or 3 days before the test. In most cases, you will not be able to eat for a period of time before the test.  Be sure to ask your health care provider if you need to change how you take any of your medicines. Often you can continue taking the medicines you take by mouth. Never make any changes in your medicines without first talking to your provider.  You will be asked to remove all jewelry on your neck, chest, or abdomen before the test.

How the Test will Feel : The x-ray may cause mild bloating but no discomfort most of the time. The barium milkshake feels chalky as you drink it.

Why the Test is Performed : This test is done to look for a problem in the structure or function of your esophagus, stomach, or small intestine.

Normal Results : A normal result shows that the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine are normal in size, shape, and movement.  Normal value ranges may vary depending on the lab doing the test. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results in the esophagus may indicate the following problems:   - Achalasia  - Diverticula  - Esophageal cancer  - Esophageal narrowing (stricture) - benign  - Hiatal hernia  - Ulcers   Abnormal results in the stomach may indicate the following problems:   - Gastric cancer  - Gastric ulcer - benign  - Gastritis  - Polyps (a tumor that is usually noncancerous and grows on the mucus membrane)  - Pyloric stenosis (narrowing)    Abnormal results in the stomach may indicate the following problems:   - Malabsorption syndrome  - Swelling and irritation of the small intestines  - Tumors  - Ulcers    The test may also be done for the following conditons:  - Annular pancreas  - Duodenal ulcer  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease  - Gastroparesis  - Intestinal obstruction  - Lower esophageal ring  - Primary or idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction

Risks : You are exposed to a low level of radiation during this test, which carries a very small risk of cancer. X-rays are monitored and regulated to provide the minimum amount of radiation exposure needed to produce the image. Most experts feel that the risk is low compared with the benefits.  Pregnant women should not have this test in most cases. Children are more sensitive to the risks of x-rays.  Barium may cause constipation. Talk to your provider if the barium has not passed through your system by 2 or 3 days after the exam.

Considerations : The upper GI series should be done after other x-ray procedures, because the barium that remains in the body may block details in other imaging tests.)

CancerGov_0000007_3_Sec4.txt,"Question: How to diagnose Childhood Liver Cancer ?
URL: https://www.cancer.gov/types/liver/patient/child-liver-treatment-pdq
Answer: Tests that examine the liver and the blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood liver cancer and find out whether the cancer has spread. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The blood of children who have liver cancer may have increased amounts of a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG) or a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Other cancers and certain noncancer conditions, including cirrhosis and hepatitis, can also increase AFP levels.    -   Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:                - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.             -   Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver damage or cancer.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as bilirubin or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) test: A blood test to check for antibodies to the EBV and DNA markers of the EBV. These are found in the blood of patients who have been infected with EBV.    -  Hepatitis assay : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked for pieces of the hepatitis virus.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the liver. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. In childhood liver cancer, an ultrasound exam of the abdomen to check the large blood vessels is usually done.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. In childhood liver cancer, a CT scan of the chest and abdomen is usually done.    -   Abdominal x-ray : An x-ray of the organs in the abdomen. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Biopsy : The removal of a sample of cells or tissues so it can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. The sample may be taken during surgery to remove or view the tumor. A pathologist looks at the sample under a microscope to find out the type of liver cancer.  The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:               -  Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test is used to check for a certain gene mutation and to tell the difference between different types of cancer.)

An x-ray method called fluoroscopy tracks how the barium moves through your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. Pictures are taken while you sit or stand in different positions.   The test most often takes around 3 hours but can take as long as 6 hours to complete.  A GI series may include this test or a barium enema.

How to Prepare for the Test : You may have to change your diet for 2 or 3 days before the test. In most cases, you will not be able to eat for a period of time before the test.  Be sure to ask your health care provider if you need to change how you take any of your medicines. Often you can continue taking the medicines you take by mouth. Never make any changes in your medicines without first talking to your provider.  You will be asked to remove all jewelry on your neck, chest, or abdomen before the test.

How the Test will Feel : The x-ray may cause mild bloating but no discomfort most of the time. The barium milkshake feels chalky as you drink it.

Why the Test is Performed : This test is done to look for a problem in the structure or function of your esophagus, stomach, or small intestine.

Normal Results : A normal result shows that the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine are normal in size, shape, and movement.  Normal value ranges may vary depending on the lab doing the test. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results in the esophagus may indicate the following problems:   - Achalasia  - Diverticula  - Esophageal cancer  - Esophageal narrowing (stricture) - benign  - Hiatal hernia  - Ulcers   Abnormal results in the stomach may indicate the following problems:   - Gastric cancer  - Gastric ulcer - benign  - Gastritis  - Polyps (a tumor that is usually noncancerous and grows on the mucus membrane)  - Pyloric stenosis (narrowing)    Abnormal results in the stomach may indicate the following problems:   - Malabsorption syndrome  - Swelling and irritation of the small intestines  - Tumors  - Ulcers    The test may also be done for the following conditons:  - Annular pancreas  - Duodenal ulcer  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease  - Gastroparesis  - Intestinal obstruction  - Lower esophageal ring  - Primary or idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction

Risks : You are exposed to a low level of radiation during this test, which carries a very small risk of cancer. X-rays are monitored and regulated to provide the minimum amount of radiation exposure needed to produce the image. Most experts feel that the risk is low compared with the benefits.  Pregnant women should not have this test in most cases. Children are more sensitive to the risks of x-rays.  Barium may cause constipation. Talk to your provider if the barium has not passed through your system by 2 or 3 days after the exam.

Considerations : The upper GI series should be done after other x-ray procedures, because the barium that remains in the body may block details in other imaging tests.)

ADAM_0000031_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Abscess ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001353.htm
Answer: Abscesses occur when an area of tissue becomes infected and the body's immune system tries to fight it. White blood cells move through the walls of the blood vessels into the area of the infection and collect in the damaged tissue. During this process, pus forms. Pus is the buildup of fluid, living and dead white blood cells, dead tissue, and bacteria or other foreign substances.  Abscesses can form in almost any part of the body. The skin, under the skin, and the teeth are the most common sites. Abscesses may be caused by bacteria, parasites, and foreign substances.  Abscesses in the skin are easy to see. They are red, raised, and painful. Abscesses in other areas of the body may not beseen, but they may cause organ damage.  Types of abscesses include:  - Abdominal abscess  - Amebic liver abscess  - Anorectal abscess  - Bartholin abscess  - Brain abscess  - Epidural abscess  - Peritonsillar abscess  - Pyogenic liver abscess  - Skin abscess  - Spinal cord abscess  - Subcutaneous abscess  - Tooth abscess)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000783.htm
Answer: Brain abscesses commonly occur when bacteria or fungi infect part of the brain. As a result, swelling and irritation (inflammation) develop. Infected brain cells, white blood cells, live and dead bacteria, or fungi collect in an area of the brain. Tissue forms around this area and creates a mass, or abscess.  The germs that cause a brain abscess can reach the brain through the blood. Or, they enter the brain directly, such as during brain surgery.  The source of the infection is often not found. However, the most common source is a lung infection. Less often, a heart infection is the cause.   The following raise your chance of developing a brain abscess:  - A weakened immune system (such as in AIDS patients)  - Chronic disease, such as cancer  - Drugs that suppress the immune system (corticosteroids or chemotherapy)  - Congenital heart disease)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001416.htm
Answer: Epidural abscess is a rare disorder caused by infection in the area between the bones of the skull, or spine, and the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meninges). This infection is called an intracranial epidural abscess if it is inside the skull area. It is called a spinal epidural abscess if it is found in the spine area. Most are located in the spine.  The spinal infection is usually caused by bacteria, but may be caused by a fungus. It can be due to other infections in the body (especially a urinary tract infection), or germs that spread through the blood. In some people, though, no other source of infection is found.  An abscess inside the skull is called an intracranial epidural abscess. The cause may be any of the following:  - Chronic ear infections  - Chronic sinusitis  - Head injury  - Mastoiditis  - Recent neurosurgery    An abscess of the spine is called a spinal epidural abscess. It may be seen in people with any of the following:  - Had back surgery or another invasive procedure involving the spine  - Bloodstream infections  - Boils especially on the back or scalp  - Bone infections of the spine (vertebral osteomyelitis)    People who inject drugs are also at increased risk.)

Answer: Most perirenal abscesses are caused by urinary tract infections that start in the bladder. They then spread to the kidney, and to the area around the kidney. Surgery in the urinary tract or reproductive system and a bloodstream infection can also lead to a perirenal abscess.  The biggest risk factor for perirenal abscess is kidney stones, by blockage of urine flow. This provides a place for an infection to grow. Bacteria tend to stick to the stones and antibiotics cannnot kill the bacteria there.  Stones are found in 20to 60% of patients with perirenal abscess.

NIHSeniorHealth_0000033_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Heart Attack ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/heartattack/toc.html
Answer: Blood Flow to the Heart Is Blocked The heart works 24 hours a day, pumping oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to the body. Blood is supplied to the heart through its coronary arteries. If a blood clot suddenly blocks a coronary artery, it cuts off most or all blood supply to the heart, and a heart attack results. If blood flow isn't restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. The more time that passes without treatment to restore blood flow, the greater the damage to the heart. Affects Both Men and Women Heart attacks are a leading killer of both men and women in the United States. Each year, more than one million people in the U.S. have a heart attack and about half of them die. Half of those who die do so within one hour of the start of symptoms and before reaching the hospital. The good news is that excellent treatments are available for heart attacks. These treatments can save lives and prevent disabilities. Prompt Treatment Is Important Heart attack treatment works best when it's given right after symptoms occur. Prompt treatment of a heart attack can help prevent or limit damage to the heart and prevent sudden death. Call 9-1-1 Right Away A heart attack is an emergency. Call 9-1-1 for an ambulance right away -- within 5 minutes -- if you think you or someone else may be having a heart attack. You also should call for help if your chest pain doesn't go away as it usually does when you take medicine prescribed for angina (chest pain). Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Emergency personnel in the ambulance can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. They carry drugs and equipment that can help your medical condition, including - oxygen   - aspirin to prevent further blood clotting   - heart medications, such as nitroglycerin   - pain relief treatments  - defibrillators that can restart the heart if it stops beating.  oxygen aspirin to prevent further blood clotting heart medications, such as nitroglycerin pain relief treatments defibrillators that can restart the heart if it stops beating. If blood flow in the blocked artery can be restored quickly, permanent heart damage may be prevented. Yet, many people do not seek medical care for 2 hours or more after symptoms start.)

URL: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/heartattack
Answer: Coronary Heart Disease
                
A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen. Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD).
                
CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside of the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.
                
When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. The buildup of plaque occurs over many years.
                
Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. This causes a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.
                
If the blockage isn't treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems.
                
Coronary Artery Spasm
                
A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. Spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren't affected by atherosclerosis.
                
What causes a coronary artery to spasm isn't always clear. A spasm may be related to:
                
Taking certain drugs, such as cocaine
                
Emotional stress or pain

Heart With Muscle Damage and a Blocked Artery
                

                
A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. Spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren't affected by atherosclerosis.
                
Heart attacks can be associated with or lead to severe health problems, such as heart failure and life-threatening arrhythmias.
                
Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats. Ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening arrhythmia that can cause death if not treated right away.
                
Don't Wait--Get Help Quickly
                
Acting fast at the first sign of heart attack symptoms can save your life and limit damage to your heart. Treatment works best when it's given right after symptoms occur.
                

                
Many people aren't sure what's wrong when they are having symptoms of a heart attack. Some of the most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are:
                
Chest pain or discomfort.Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion.
                
Upper body discomfort.You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button).
                
Shortness of breath.This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity.
                
Other possible symptoms of a heart attack include:
                
Breaking out in a cold sweat
                
Feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman)
                
Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting
                
Light-headedness or sudden dizziness
                
Any sudden, new symptom or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual)
                
Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies, or other common symptoms such as chest discomfort. The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they've had a heart attack. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one.
                
Quick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 911
                
If you think you or someone else may be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don't ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 911 for emergency medical care. Acting fast can save your life.
                
Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. Take a nitroglycerin pill if your doctor has prescribed this type of treatment.)

Other Causes Heart attack also can occur due to problems with the very small, microscopic blood vessels of the heart. This condition is called microvascular disease. It's believed to be more common in women than in men. A less common cause of heart attacks is a severe spasm or tightening of the coronary artery that cuts off blood flow to the heart. These spasms can occur in persons with or without coronary artery disease. What causes a coronary artery to spasm isn't always clear. A spasm may be related to emotional stress or pain, exposure to extreme cold, cigarette smoking, or by taking certain drugs like cocaine. Risk Factors You Cannot Change Certain factors make it more likely that you will develop coronary artery disease and have a heart attack. These risk factors include some things you cannot change. If you are a man over age 45 or a woman over age 55, you are at greater risk. Having a family history of early heart disease, diagnosed in a father or brother before age 55 or in a mother or sister before age 65, is another risk factor. You are also at risk if you have a personal history of angina or previous heart attack, or if you have had a heart procedure such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Risk Factors You Can Change Importantly, there are many risk factors that you can change. These include - smoking  - being overweight or obese  - physical inactivity  - high blood pressure  - high blood cholesterol  - high blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetes   - an unhealthy diet (for example, a diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium). smoking being overweight or obese physical inactivity high blood pressure high blood cholesterol high blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetes an unhealthy diet (for example, a diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium). Metabolic Syndrome Some of these risk factorssuch as obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugartend to occur together. When they do, it's called metabolic syndrome. In general, a person with metabolic syndrome is twice as likely to develop heart disease and five times as likely to develop diabetes as someone without metabolic syndrome.)

NIHSeniorHealth_0000033_Sec8.txt,"Question: What causes Heart Attack ?
URL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/heartattack/toc.html
Answer: Coronary heart disease, or CHD, is the most common underlying cause of a heart attack. Coronary arteries are the blood vessels that bring blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. Most heart attacks are caused by a blood clot that blocks one of the coronary arteries. When blood cannot reach part of your heart, that area starves for oxygen. If the blockage continues long enough, cells in the affected area die.)

Answer: Obesity means having too much body fat. It is not the same as overweight, which means weighing too much. Obesity is becoming much more common in childhood. Most often, it begins between the ages of 5 and 6 and in adolescence.  Child health experts recommend that children be screened for obesity at age 2. If needed, they should be referred to weight-management programs.)

Answer: There are two major types of stroke:   - Ischemic stroke  - Hemorrhagic stroke    Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. This may happen in two ways:   - A clot may form in an artery that is already very narrow. This is called a thrombotic stroke.  - A clot may break off from another place in the blood vessels of the brain, or from some other part of the body, and travel up to the brain. This is called cerebral embolism, or an embolic stroke.    Ischemic strokes may also be caused by a sticky substance called plaque that can clog arteries.       Watch this video about:   Stroke         Watch this video about:   Stroke - secondary to cardiogenic embolism     A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in part of the brain becomes weak and bursts open. This causes blood to leak into the brain. Some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely. These defects may include:   - Aneurysm  - Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)    Hemorrhagic strokes may also occur when someone is taking blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin). Very high blood pressure may cause blood vessels to burst, leading to hemorrhagic stroke.   An ischemic stroke can develop bleeding and become a hemorrhagic stroke.  High blood pressure is the main risk factor for strokes. Other major risk factors are:  - Irregular heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation  - Diabetes  - Family history of stroke  - High cholesterol  - Increasing age, especially after age 55  - Ethnicity (African Americans are more likely to die of a stroke)        Watch this video about:   Hypertension - overview     Stroke risk is also higher in:   - People who have heart disease or poor blood flow in their legs caused by narrowed arteries  - People who have unhealthy lifestyle habits such as smoking, a high-fat diet, and lack of exercise  - Women who take birth control pills (especially those who smoke and are older than 35)  - Women who are pregnant have an increased risk while pregnant  - Women who take hormone replacement therapy)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000726.htm
Answer: Symptoms of stroke depend on which part of the brain is damaged. In some cases, a person may not know that a stroke has occurred.   Most of the time, symptoms develop suddenly and without warning. But symptoms may occur on and off for the first day or two. Symptoms are usually most severe when the stroke first happens, but they may slowly get worse.   A headache may occur if the stroke is caused by bleeding in the brain. The headache:   - Starts suddenly and may be severe  - May be worse when you are lying flat  - Wakes you up from sleep  - Gets worse when you change positions or when you bend, strain, or cough     Other symptoms depend on how severe the stroke is, and what part of the brain is affected. Symptoms may include:  - Change in alertness (including sleepiness, unconsciousness, and coma)  - Changes in hearing or taste  - Changes that affect touch and the ability to feel pain, pressure, or different temperatures  - Confusion or loss of memory  - Problems swallowing  - Problems writing or reading  - Dizziness or abnormal feeling of movement (vertigo)  - Eyesight problems, such as decreased vision, double vision, or total loss of vision  - Lack of control over the bladder or bowels  - Loss of balance or coordination, or trouble walking  - Muscle weakness in the face, arm, or leg (usually just on one side)  - Numbness or tingling on one side of the body  - Personality, mood, or emotional changes  - Trouble speaking or understanding others who are speaking)

Answer: The doctor will do a physical exam to:   - Check for problems with vision, movement, feeling, reflexes, understanding, and speaking. Your doctor and nurses will repeat this exam over time to see if your stroke is getting worse or improving.  - Listen to the carotid arteries in the neck with a stethoscope for an abnormal sound, called a bruit, which is caused by abnormal blood flow.  - Check for high blood pressure.     You may have the following tests to help find the type, location, and cause of the stroke and rule out other problems:   - Angiogram of the head to look for a blood vessel that is blocked or bleeding  - Carotid duplex (ultrasound) to see if the carotid arteries in your neck have narrowed  - Echocardiogram to see if the stroke could have been caused by a blood clot from the heart  - Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or CT angiography to check for abnormal blood vessels in the brain    Other tests include:   - Blood tests  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rhythm monitoring)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000726.htm
Answer: A stroke is a medical emergency. Quick treatment is needed. Call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number right away or seek urgent medical care at the first signs of a stroke.   People who are having stroke symptoms need to get to a hospital as quickly as possible.   - If the stroke is caused by a blood clot, a clot-busting drug may be given to dissolve the clot.  - To be effective, this treatment must be started within 3 to 4 1/2 hours of when the symptoms first started. The sooner this treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome.    Other treatments given in the hospital depend on the cause of the stroke. These may include:   - Blood thinners such as heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), aspirin, or clopidogrel (Plavix)  - Medicine to control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol  - Special procedures or surgery to relieve symptoms or prevent more strokes  - Nutrients and fluids    Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy will all begin in the hospital. If the person has severe swallowing problems, a feeding tube in the stomach (gastrostomy tube) will likely be needed.  The goal of treatment after a stroke is to help you recover as much function as possible and prevent future strokes.   Recovery from your stroke will begin while you are still in the hospital or at a rehabilitation center. It will continue when you go home from the hospital or center. Be sure to follow up with your health care provider after you go home.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000726.htm
Answer: How well a person does after a stroke depends on:  - The type of stroke  - How much brain tissue is damaged  - What body functions have been affected  - How quickly treatment is given    Problems moving, thinking, and talking often improve in the weeks to months after a stroke.  Many people who have had a stroke will keep improving in the months or years after their stroke.   Over half of people who have a stroke are able to function and live at home. Others are not able to care for themselves.  If treatment with clot-busting drugs is successful, the symptoms of a stroke may go away. However, patients often do not get to the hospital soon enough to receive these drugs, or they can't take these drugs because of a health condition.  People who have a stroke from a blood clot (ischemic stroke) have a better chance of surviving than those who have a stroke from bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke).  The risk for a second stroke is highest during the weeks or months after the first stroke. The risk begins to decrease after this period.)

Answer: Stroke is a medical emergency that needs to be treated right away. The acronym F.A.S.T. is an easy way to remember signs of stroke and what to do if you think a stroke has occurred. The most important action to take is to immediately call 9-1-1 for emergency assistance.   F.A.S.T. stands for:  - FACE. Ask the person to smile. Check to see if one side of the face droops.  - ARMS. Ask the person to raise both arms. See if one arm drifts downward.  - SPEECH. Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Check to see if words are slurred and if the sentence is repeated correctly.  - TIME. If a person shows any of these symptoms, time is essential.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ischemicstroke.html
Answer: A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is the most common type. It is usually caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This keeps blood from flowing to the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. Another cause is stenosis, or narrowing of the artery. This can happen because of atherosclerosis, a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke.    Symptoms of stroke are       - Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)    - Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech    - Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes    - Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination    - Sudden severe headache with no known cause       It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible.

ADAM_0000929_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Complement component 3 (C3) (Also called: C3)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003539.htm
Answer: Summary : Complement C3 is a blood test that measures the activity of a certain protein that is part of the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that move freely through your bloodstream. The proteins work with your immune system and play a role in the development of inflammation.  There are nine major complement proteins. They are labeled C1 through C9. This test measures C3.

How the Test is Performed : Blood is drawn from a vein. Most often, a vein from the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand is used. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.  Next, the provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm.  Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.  In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.

How to Prepare for the Test : There is no special preparation needed.

How the Test will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.

Why the Test is Performed : C3 and C4 are the most commonly measured complement components.  A complement test may be used to monitor people with an autoimmune disorder and to see if treatment for their condition is working. When the complement system is turned on during inflammation, levels of complement proteins may go down. For example, patients with active lupus erythematosus may have lower-than-normal levels of the complement proteins C3 and C4.  Complement activity varies throughout the body. For example, in people with rheumatoid arthritis, complement activity in the blood may be normal or higher-than-normal, but much lower-than-normal in the joint fluid.  The test may also be done for the following conditions:   - Fungal infections  - Gram negative septicemia  - Parasitic infections, such as malaria  - Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)  - Shock

Normal Results : The normal range is 75 to 135 mg/dl (milligrams per deciliter).  Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.  The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Increased complement activity may be seen in:  - Cancer  - Ulcerative colitis   Decreased complement activity may be seen in:  - Bacterial infections (especially Neisseria)  - Cirrhosis  - Glomerulonephritis  - Hepatitis  - Hereditary angioedema  - Kidney transplant rejection  - Lupus nephritis  - Malnutrition  - Systemic lupus erythematosus

Risks : Risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling lightheaded  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)

Considerations : The ""complement cascade"" is a series of reactions that take place in the blood. The cascade activates the complement proteins. The result is an attack unit that creates holes in the membrane of bacteria, killing them. C3 attaches to and kills bacteria directly.)

You may need to take medicines to lower your blood pressure if lifestyle changes are not enough to bring your blood pressure to the target level.   WHEN ARE MEDICINES FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE USED  Most of the time, your health care provider will try lifestyle changes first and check your BP 2 or more times. Medicines will likely be started if your BP readings remain at or above these levels:  - Top number (systolic pressure) of 140 or more in people younger than 60 years  - Top number of 150 or more in people 60 years and older  - Bottom number (diastolic pressure) of 90 or more    If you have diabetes, heart problems, or a history of a stroke, medicines may be started at lower blood pressure reading. The most commonly used blood pressure targets for people with these medical problems are below 130 to 140/80 mmHg.  MEDICINES FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE  Most of the time, only a single drug will be used at first. Two drugs may be started if your   - Systolic BP is above 160  - Diastolic BP is above 100    Several types of medicine are used to treat high blood pressure. Your provider will decide which type of medicine is right for you. You may need to take more than one type.  Each type of blood pressure medicine listed below comes in different brand and generic names.  One or more of these blood pressure medicines are often used to treat high blood pressure:  - Diuretics are also called water pills. They help your kidneys remove some salt (sodium) from your body. As a result, your blood vessels do not have to hold as much fluid and your blood pressure goes down.  - Beta-blockers make the heart beat at a slower rate and with less force.  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (also called ACE inhibitors) relax your blood vessels, which lowers your blood pressure.  - Angiotensin II receptor blockers (also called ARBs) work in about the same way as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.  - Calcium channel blockers relax blood vessels by stopping calcium from entering cells.    Blood pressure medicines that are not used as often include:  - Alpha-blockers help relax your blood vessels, which lowers your blood pressure.  - Centrally acting drugs signal your brain and nervous system to relax your blood vessels.  - Vasodilators signal the muscles in the walls of blood vessels to relax.  - Renin inhibitors, a newer type of medicine for treating high blood pressure, act by reducing the amount of angiotensin precursors thereby relaxing your blood vessels.    SIDE EFFECTS OF BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICINES  Most blood pressure medicines are easy to take, but all medicines have side effects. Most of these are mild and may go away over time.  Some common side effects of high blood pressure medicines include:  - Cough  - Diarrhea or constipation  - Dizziness or light-headedness  - Erection problems  - Feeling nervous  - Feeling tired, weak, drowsy, or a lack of energy  - Headache  - Nausea or vomiting  - Skin rash  - Weight loss or gain without trying    Tell your provider as soon as possible if you have side effects or the side effects are causing you problems. Most of the time, making changes to the dose of medicine or when you take it can help reduce side effects.   Never change the dose or stop taking a medicine on your own. Always talk to your provider first.  OTHER TIPS  Taking more than one medicine may change how your body absorbs or uses a drug. Vitamins or supplements, different foods, or alcohol may also change how a drug acts in your body.  Always ask your provider whether you need to avoid any foods, drinks, vitamins or supplements, or any other medicines while you are taking blood pressure medicine.)

ADAM_0002560_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Medicines for ADHD
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007592.htm
Answer: Summary : ADHD is a problem that most often affects children. Adults may be affected as well. People with ADHD may have problems with:   - Being able to focus  - Being over-active  - Not being able to control behavior    Medicines can help improve symptoms of ADHD. Talk or behavioral therapy can also help. Work closely with your health care providers to ensure that the treatment plan is successful. TYPES OF MEDICINES  Stimulants are the most commonly used type of ADHD medicine. Some medicines are taken more than one time a day, while others are taken only once a day. Your provider will decide which medicine is best.  Know the name and dose of each medicine you take. FINDING THE RIGHT MEDICINE AND DOSAGE  It is important to work with your provider to make sure the right medicine is given at the right dose.  Always take your medicine the way it was prescribed. Talk to your provider if a medicine is not controlling symptoms, or if you are having side effects. The dose may need to be changed, or a new medicine may need to be tried. MEDICINE TIPS  Some medicines for ADHD wear off over the day. Taking them before going to school or work may allow them to work when you need them the most. Your provider will advise you on this.  Other tips are:  - Refill your medicine before it runs out.  - Ask your provider whether your medicine should be taken with food or when there is no food in the stomach.  - DO NOT reduce your dose to save money. If you are having problems paying for medicine, talk with your provider. There may be programs that provide medicines for free or at a lower cost.   SAFETY TIPS FOR MEDICINE  Learn about the side effects of each medicine. Ask your provider what to do in case of side effects. Call your provider if you or your child notices side effects such as:  - Stomach pain  - Problems falling or staying asleep  - Eating less or weight-loss  - Tics or jerky movements  - Mood changes  - Unusual thoughts  - Hearing or seeing things that aren't there  - Fast heart beat    DO NOT use supplements or herbal remedies without checking with your provider. DO NOT use street drugs. Any of these may cause your ADHD medicines not to work as well.   Check with your provider about whether any other medicines should not be taken at the same time as ADHD medicines. MEDICINE TIPS FOR PARENTS  Regularly reinforce with your child the provider's treatment plan. Teach your child that these medicines can help him or her feel better and do better in school.  Children with ADHD often forget to take their medicines. Have your child set up a system, such as using a pill organizer. This can remind your child to take medicine.   Keep a close watch on possible side effects. Ask your child to tell you about any side effects. But be aware that your child may not understand when he or she is having side effects. Call the provider right away if your child does have side effects.  Be aware of possible drug abuse. Stimulant-type ADHD medicines can be dangerous in high doses. To ensure your child uses medicines safely:  - Talk to your child about the dangers of drug abuse.  - Teach your child not to share or sell their medicines.  - Monitor your child's medicines closely.)

ADAM_0002903_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Over-the-counter medicines (Also called: Medicines to have at home)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002208.htm
Answer: Summary : You can buy many medicines for minor problems at the store without a prescription (over-the-counter).   Important tips for using over-the-counter medicines:  - Always follow the printed directions and warnings. Talk to your health care provider before starting a new medicine.  - Know what you are taking. Look at the list of ingredients and choose products that have fewer items listed.  - All medicines become less effective over time and should be replaced. Check the expiration date before using any product.  - Store medicines in a cool, dry area. Keep all medicines out of the reach of children.    Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should talk to their provider before taking any new medicine.   Medicines affect children and older adults differently. People in these age groups should take special care when taking over-the-counter medicines.   Check with your provider before taking an over-the-counter medicine if:  - Your symptoms are very bad.  - You are not sure what is wrong with you.  - You have a long-term medical problem or you are taking prescription medicines.    ACHES, PAINS, AND HEADACHES   Over-the-counter pain medicines can help with headache, arthritis pain, sprains, and other minor joint and muscle problems.   - Acetaminophen. Try this medicine first for your pain. DO NOT take more than 4 grams (4,000 mg) on any 1 day.  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). You can buy some NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, without a prescription.    Both of these medicines can have serious side effects if you take them in high doses or for a long time. Tell your provider if you are taking these medicines many times a week. You may need to be checked for side effects.  FEVER   Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help reduce fever in children and adults.   - Take acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours.  - Take ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours. DO NOT use ibuprofen in children younger than 6 months.  - Know how much you or your child weighs before giving these medicines.    Aspirin works very well for treating fever in adults. DO NOT give aspirin to a child unless your child's provider tells you it is OK. COLD, SORE THROAT, COUGH   Cold medicines can treat symptoms to make you feel better, but they do not shorten a cold. Taking zinc supplements within 24 hours of the start of a cold may reduce the symptoms and duration of a cold.   NOTE: Talk to your provider before giving your child any type of over-the-counter cold medicine, even if it is labeled for children.   Cough medicines:   - Guaifenesin: Helps break up mucus. Drink lots of fluids if you take this medicine.  - Menthol throat lozenges: Soothe ""tickle"" in the throat (Halls, Robitussin, Vicks).  - Liquid cough medicines with dextromethorphan: Suppress the urge to cough (Benylin, Delsym, Robitussin DM, Simply Cough, Vicks 44, and store brands).    Decongestants:  - Decongestants help clear a runny nose and relieve postnasal drip.  - Decongestant nasal sprays may work more quickly, but they can have a rebound effect if you use them for more than 3 to 5 days. Your symptoms may get worse if you keep using these sprays.  - Check with your provider before taking decongestants if you have high blood pressure or prostate problems.  - Oral decongestants: Pseudophedrine (Contac Non-Drowsy, Sudafed, and store brands); phenylephrine (Sudafed PE and store brands)  - Decongestant nasal sprays: Oxymetazoline (Afrin, Neo-Synephrine Nighttime, Sinex Spray); phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine, Sinex Capsules).    Sore throat medicines:  - Sprays to numb pain: Dyclonine (Cepacol); phenol (Chloraseptic).  - Painkillers: Acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve).  - Hard candies that coat throat: Sucking on candy or throat lozenges can be soothing. Be careful in young children because of the choking risk.    ALLERGIES   Antihistamine pills and liquids work well for treating allergy symptoms.  - Antihistamines that may cause sleepiness: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl); chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton); brompheniramine (Dimetapp), or clemastine (Tavist).  - Antihistamines that cause little or no sleepiness: Loratadine (Alavert, Claritin, Dimetapp ND); fexofenadine (Allegra); cetirizine (Zyrtec).    Talk to your provider before giving medicines that cause sleepiness to a child, because they can affect learning. They can also affect alertness in adults.  You can also try:   - Eye drops: Soothe or moisten the eyes  - Preventive nasal spray: Cromolyn sodium (Nasalcrom), fluticasone (Flonase)    STOMACH UPSET   Medicines for diarrhea:  - Antidiarrhea medicines such as loperamide (Imodium): These medicines slow down action of intestine and reduce number of bowel movements. Talk to your provider before taking them because they can worsen diarrhea caused by infection.  - Medicines that contain bismuth: May be taken for mild diarrhea (Kaopectate, Pepto-Bismol)  - Rehydration fluids: May be used for moderate and severe diarrhea (Enfalyte or Pedialyte)    Medicines for nausea and vomiting:  - Liquids and pills for stomach upset: May help with mild nausea and vomiting (Emetrol; Pepto-Bismol)  - Rehydration fluids: May be used to replace fluids from vomiting (Enfalyte or Pedialyte)  - Medicines for motion sickness: Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine); meclizine (Bonine, Antivert, Postafen, and Sea Legs)    SKIN RASHES AND ITCHING   - Antihistamines taken by mouth: May help with itching or if you have allergies.  - Hydrocortisone cream: May help with mild rashes (Cortaid, Cortizone 10)  - Antifungal creams and ointments: May help with diaper rashes and rashes caused by yeast (nystatin, miconazole, clotrimazole, and ketoconazole).)

ADAM_0003736_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Storing your medicines
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000534.htm
Answer: Summary : Medications - storing

Description : Where you store your medicine can affect how well it works. Learn about storing your medicine properly to keep it from getting damaged.

Store medicines safely : Take care of your medicine.  - Know that heat, air, light, and moisture may damage your medicine.  - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place. For example, store it in your dresser drawer or a kitchen cabinet away from the stove, sink, and any hot appliances. You can also store medicine in a storage box, on a shelf, in a closet.  - If you are like most people, you probably store your medicine in a bathroom cabinet. But the heat and moisture from your shower, bath, and sink may damage your medicine. Your medicines can become less potent, or they may go bad before the expiration date.  - Pills and capsules are easily damaged by heat and moisture. Aspirin pills break down into vinegar and salicylic acid. This irritates the stomach.  - Always keep medicine in its original container.  - Take the cotton ball out of the medicine bottle. The cotton ball pulls moisture into the bottle.  - Ask your pharmacist about any specific storage instructions.    Keep children safe.  - Always store your medicine out of reach and out of sight of children.  - Store your medicine in a cabinet with a child latch or lock.

Do not take damaged medicine : Damaged medicine may make you sick. Do not take:  - Medicine that has changed color, texture, or smell, even if it has not expired  - Pills that stick together, are harder or softer than normal, or are cracked or chipped

Get rid of old medicines : - Check the expiration date on your medicine. Throw out medicines that are out of date.  - Do not keep old or unused medicine around. It goes bad and you should not use it.    Get rid of unused medicine safely and promptly.  - Do not flush your medicine down the toilet. This is bad for the water supply.  - To throw away medicine in the trash, first mix your medicine with something that ruins it, such as coffee grounds or kitty litter. Put the entire mixture in a sealed plastic bag.  - You can also bring unused medicines to your pharmacist.  - Use community ""drug give back"" programs if they are available.  - Visit the U.S. Food and Drug Administration web site for more information: How to dispose of unused medications.

Traveling with medicine : Do not keep medicine in the glove compartment of your car. Medicine can get too hot, cold, or wet there.  If you are taking an airplane, keep your medicine in your carry-on luggage. To help with security at the airport:  - Keep medicine in the original bottles.  - Ask your doctor for a copy of all your prescriptions. You may need this in case you lose, run out, or damage your medicine.  - If you have diabetes, ask your doctor for a letter explaining that you have diabetes and providing a list of all your supplies. You are allowed to carry your medicine, blood glucose meter, and lancet device on a plane.

When to call the doctor : Call your doctor for:  - New prescriptions before you throw out your old medicine  - A letter describing your condition, medicines, and supplies when needed)

ADAM_0003841_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Taking medicines to treat tuberculosis ? (Also called: Tuberculosis - medicines; DOT; Directly observed therapy; TB - medicines)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000425.htm
Answer: Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious bacterial infection that involves the lungs, but may spread to other organs.  You may have a TB infection but no active disease or symptoms. This means the TB bacteria remain inactive (dormant) in a small area of your lungs. This type of infection may be present for years and is called latent TB. With latent TB:   - You cannot spread TB to other people.  - In some people, the bacteria can become active. If this happens, you may become sick or you can pass the TB germs to someone else.  - Even though you do not feel sick, you need to take medicines for TB for 6 to 9 months. This is the only way to make sure all of the TB bacteria in your body are killed.    When you have active TB, you may feel sick or have a cough, lose weight, feel tired, or have a fever or night sweats. In this case:  - You can pass TB to people around you. This includes people you live, work, or come in close contact with.  - You need to take medicines for TB for at least 6 months to rid your body of the TB bacteria. You should begin to feel better within a month of starting medicines.  - For the first 2 to 4 weeks after starting the medicines, you may need to stay home to avoid spreading TB to others. Ask your doctor when it is OK to be around others.  - Your doctor is required by law to report your case to the local public health department.    Ask your doctor whether others with whom you work or live should be tested for TB.)

Answer: Several weight-loss medicines are available. Ask your health care provider if any are right for you.  About 5 to 10 pounds can be lost by taking these medicines. But not everyone loses weight while taking them. Most people also regain the weight after they stop taking the medicines, unless they have made lasting lifestyle changes, such as exercising and cutting unhealthy foods from their diets.  You may also see ads for herbal remedies and supplements that claim to help you lose weight. Many of these claims are not true. Some of these supplements can have serious side effects.  Note for women: Pregnant or nursing women should never take diet medicines. This includes prescription, herbal, and over-the-counter remedies. Over-the-counter refers to medicines, herbs, or supplements you can buy without a prescription.)

GHR_0000208_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) complement component 2 deficiency ? (Also called: C2 deficiency; C2D; complement 2 deficiency)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/complement-component-2-deficiency
Answer: Complement component 2 deficiency is a disorder that causes the immune system to malfunction, resulting in a form of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiencies are conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body effectively from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. People with complement component 2 deficiency have a significantly increased risk of recurrent bacterial infections, specifically of the lungs (pneumonia), the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis), and the blood (sepsis), which may be life-threatening. These infections most commonly occur in infancy and childhood and become less frequent in adolescence and adulthood.  Complement component 2 deficiency is also associated with an increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or vasculitis. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs. Between 10 and 20 percent of individuals with complement component 2 deficiency develop SLE. Females with complement component 2 deficiency are more likely to have SLE than affected males, but this is also true of SLE in the general population.  The severity of complement component 2 deficiency varies widely. While some affected individuals experience recurrent infections and other immune system difficulties, others do not have any health problems related to the disorder.)

GHR_0000208_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to complement component 2 deficiency ? (Also called: C2 deficiency; C2D; complement 2 deficiency)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/complement-component-2-deficiency
Answer: Complement component 2 deficiency is caused by mutations in the C2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making the complement component 2 protein, which helps regulate a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders, trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. The complement component 2 protein is involved in the pathway that turns on (activates) the complement system when foreign invaders, such as bacteria, are detected.  The most common C2 gene mutation, which is found in more than 90 percent of people with complement component 2 deficiency, prevents the production of complement component 2 protein. A lack of this protein impairs activation of the complement pathway. As a result, the complement system's ability to fight infections is diminished. It is unclear how complement component 2 deficiency leads to an increase in autoimmune disorders. Researchers speculate that the dysfunctional complement system is unable to distinguish what it should attack, and it sometimes attacks normal tissues, leading to autoimmunity. Alternatively, the dysfunctional complement system may perform partial attacks on invading molecules, which leaves behind foreign fragments that are difficult to distinguish from the body's tissues, so the complement system sometimes attacks the body's own cells. It is likely that other factors, both genetic and environmental, play a role in the variability of the signs and symptoms of complement component 2 deficiency.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/complement-component-2-deficiency
Answer: This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.)

Answer: Complement factor I deficiency is a disorder that affects the immune system. People with this condition are prone to recurrent infections, including infections of the upper respiratory tract, ears, skin, and urinary tract. They may also contract more serious infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis, which may be life-threatening.  Some people with complement factor I deficiency have a kidney disorder called glomerulonephritis with isolated C3 deposits. Complement factor I deficiency can also be associated with autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/complement-factor-i-deficiency
Answer: Complement factor I deficiency is caused by mutations in the CFI gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called complement factor I. This protein helps regulate a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. This system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not attack the body's healthy cells. Complement factor I and several related proteins protect healthy cells by preventing activation of the complement system when it is not needed.  Mutations in the CFI gene that cause complement factor I deficiency result in abnormal, nonfunctional, or absent complement factor I. The lack (deficiency) of functional complement factor I protein allows uncontrolled activation of the complement system. The unregulated activity of the complement system decreases blood levels of another complement protein called C3, reducing the immune system's ability to fight infections. In addition, the immune system may malfunction and attack its own tissues, resulting in autoimmune disorders.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/diabetesmedicines.html
Answer: Summary : Diabetes means your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. If you can't control your diabetes with wise food choices and physical activity, you may need diabetes medicines. The kind of medicine you take depends on your type of diabetes, your schedule, and your other health conditions.     With type 1 diabetes, your pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. If you have type 1 diabetes, you will need to take insulin.     Type 2 diabetes, the most common type, can start when the body doesn't use insulin as it should. If your body can't keep up with the need for insulin, you may need to take pills. Along with meal planning and physical activity, diabetes pills help people with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes keep their blood glucose levels on target. Several kinds of pills are available. Each works in a different way. Many people take two or three kinds of pills. Some people take combination pills. Combination pills contain two kinds of diabetes medicine in one tablet. Some people take pills and insulin.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)

When you give medicine to your child, be sure you're giving the right medicine and the right amount. Read and follow the label directions. Use the correct dosing device. If the label says two teaspoons and you're using a dosing cup with ounces only, don't guess. Get the proper measuring device. Don't substitute another item, such as a kitchen spoon. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care provider before giving two medicines at the same time. That way, you can avoid a possible overdose or an unwanted interaction.

Always speak with your health care provider before you start or stop any medicine. Not using medicine that you need may be more harmful to you and your baby than using the medicine. For example, many pregnant women take prescription medicines for health problems like diabetes, asthma, seizures, and heartburn. The decision about whether or not to take a medicine depends on the risks and benefits. You and your health care provider should make this choice together.    Pregnant women should not take regular vitamins. They may have too much or too little of the vitamins that you need. There are special vitamins for pregnant women. It is important to take 0.4 mg of folic acid every day before you become pregnant through the first part of your pregnancy. Folic acid helps to prevent birth defects of the baby's brain or spine.

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/autoimmune-addison-disease
Answer: The cause of autoimmune Addison disease is complex and not completely understood. A combination of environmental and genetic factors plays a role in the disorder, and changes in multiple genes are thought to affect the risk of developing the condition.  The genes that have been associated with autoimmune Addison disease participate in the body's immune response. The most commonly associated genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. The most well-known risk factor for autoimmune Addison disease is a variant of the HLA-DRB1 gene called HLA-DRB1*04:04. This and other disease-associated HLA gene variants likely contribute to an inappropriate immune response that leads to autoimmune Addison disease, although the mechanism is unknown.  Normally, the immune system responds only to proteins made by foreign invaders, not to the body's own proteins. In autoimmune Addison disease, however, an immune response is triggered by a normal adrenal gland protein, typically a protein called 21-hydroxylase. This protein plays a key role in producing certain hormones in the adrenal glands. The prolonged immune attack triggered by 21-hydroxylase damages the adrenal glands (specifically the outer layers of the glands known, collectively, as the adrenal cortex), preventing hormone production. A shortage of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency) disrupts several normal functions in the body, leading to hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypotension, muscle cramps, skin hyperpigmentation and other features of autoimmune Addison disease.  Rarely, Addison disease is not caused by an autoimmune reaction. Other causes include infections that damage the adrenal glands, such as tuberculosis, or tumors in the adrenal glands. Addison disease can also be one of several features of other genetic conditions, including X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and autoimmune polyglandular syndrome, type 1, which are caused by mutations in other genes.)

ADAM_0000365_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Autoimmune disorders ?
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000816.htm
Answer: The blood cells in the body's immune system help protect against harmful substances. Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces antibodies against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances.  When you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and antigens. As a result, the body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues.   The exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders.  An autoimmune disorder may result in:  - The destruction of body tissue  - Abnormal growth of an organ  - Changes in organ function    An autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include:  - Blood vessels  - Connective tissues  - Endocrine glands such as the thyroid or pancreas  - Joints  - Muscles  - Red blood cells  - Skin    A person may have more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time. Common autoimmune disorders include:  - Addison disease  - Celiac disease - sprue (gluten-sensitive enteropathy)  - Dermatomyositis  - Graves disease  - Hashimoto thyroiditis  - Multiple sclerosis  - Myasthenia gravis  - Pernicious anemia  - Reactive arthritis  - Rheumatoid arthritis  - Sjgren syndrome  - Systemic lupus erythematosus  - Type I diabetes)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/autoimmune-addison-disease
Answer: Autoimmune Addison disease affects the function of the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. It is classified as an autoimmune disorder because it results from a malfunctioning immune system that attacks the adrenal glands. As a result, the production of several hormones is disrupted, which affects many body systems.  The signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease can begin at any time, although they most commonly begin between ages 30 and 50. Common features of this condition include extreme tiredness (fatigue), nausea, decreased appetite, and weight loss. In addition, many affected individuals have low blood pressure (hypotension), which can lead to dizziness when standing up quickly; muscle cramps; and a craving for salty foods. A characteristic feature of autoimmune Addison disease is abnormally dark areas of skin (hyperpigmentation), especially in regions that experience a lot of friction, such as the armpits, elbows, knuckles, and palm creases. The lips and the inside lining of the mouth can also be unusually dark. Because of an imbalance of hormones involved in development of sexual characteristics, women with this condition may lose their underarm and pubic hair.  Other signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease include low levels of sugar (hypoglycemia) and sodium (hyponatremia) and high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia) in the blood. Affected individuals may also have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and an increase in the number of white blood cells (lymphocytosis), particularly those known as eosinophils (eosinophilia).  Autoimmune Addison disease can lead to a life-threatening adrenal crisis, characterized by vomiting, abdominal pain, back or leg cramps, and severe hypotension leading to shock. The adrenal crisis is often triggered by a stressor, such as surgery, trauma, or infection.  Individuals with autoimmune Addison disease or their family members often have another autoimmune disorder, most commonly autoimmune thyroid disease or type 1 diabetes.)

Answer: Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronicor long lastingdisease in which the body's immune system attacks the normal components, or cells, of the liver and causes inflammation and liver damage. The immune system normally protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances.
                
Autoimmune hepatitis is a serious condition that may worsen over time if not treated. Autoimmune hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Cirrhosis occurs when scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue and blocks the normal flow of blood through the liver. Liver failure occurs when the liver stops working properly.)

Answer: Autoimmune hepatitis is classified into several types. Type 1 autoimmune hepatitis is the most common form in North America. Type 1 can occur at any age; however, it most often starts in adolescence or young adulthood. About 70 percent of people with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis are female.1
                
People with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis commonly have other autoimmune disorders, such as
                
- celiac disease, an autoimmune disease in which people cannot tolerate gluten because it damages the lining of their small intestine and prevents absorption of nutrients  - Crohn's disease, which causes inflammation and irritation of any part of the digestive tract  - Graves' disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States  - Hashimoto's disease, also called chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or autoimmune thyroiditis, a form of chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland  - proliferative glomerulonephritis, or inflammation of the glomeruli, which are tiny clusters of looping blood vessels in the kidneys  - primary sclerosing cholangitis, which causes irritation, scarring, and narrowing of the bile ducts inside and outside the liver  - rheumatoid arthritis, which causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints  - Sjgren's syndrome, which causes dryness in the mouth and eyes  - systemic lupus erythematosus, which causes kidney inflammation called lupus nephritis  - type 1 diabetes, a condition characterized by high blood glucose, also called blood sugar, levels caused by a total lack of insulin  - ulcerative colitis, a chronic disease that causes inflammation and sores, called ulcers, in the inner lining of the large intestine
                
Type 2 autoimmune hepatitis is less common and occurs more often in children than adults.1 People with type 2 can also have any of the above autoimmune disorders.)

NIDDK_0000182_Sec6.txt,"Question: How to diagnose Autoimmune Hepatitis ?
URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/liver-disease/autoimmune-hepatitis/Pages/facts.aspx
Answer: A health care provider will make a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis based on symptoms, a physical exam, blood tests, and a liver biopsy.
                
A health care provider performs a physical exam and reviews the person's health history, including the use of alcohol and medications that can harm the liver. A person usually needs blood tests for an exact diagnosis because a person with autoimmune hepatitis can have the same symptoms as those of other liver diseases or metabolic disorders.
                
Blood tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A person will need blood tests for autoantibodies to help distinguish autoimmune hepatitis from other liver diseases that have similar symptoms, such as viral hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, steatohepatitis, or Wilson disease.
                
Liver biopsy. A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to temporarily stop taking certain medications before the liver biopsy. He or she may also ask the patient to fast for 8 hours before the procedure.
                
During the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. A health care provider will apply a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle. If needed, he or she will give sedatives and pain medication. Then, he or she will use a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue, and may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. After the biopsy, the patient must lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home.
                
A health care provider performs a liver biopsy at a hospital or an outpatient center. The liver sample is sent to a pathology lab where the pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseaselooks at the tissue with a microscope and sends a report to the patient's health care provider.
                
A health care provider can use liver biopsy to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis and determine if cirrhosis is present. People often have cirrhosis at the time they are diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. A health care provider can also use liver biopsy to look for changes in the severity of liver damage prior to ending treatment for autoimmune hepatitis.)

NIDDK_0000182_Sec7.txt,"Question: What are the treatments for Autoimmune Hepatitis ?
URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/liver-disease/autoimmune-hepatitis/Pages/facts.aspx
Answer: Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis includes medication to suppress, or slow down, an overactive immune system. Treatment may also include a liver transplant.
                
Treatment works best when autoimmune hepatitis is diagnosed early. People with autoimmune hepatitis generally respond to standard treatment and the disease can be controlled in most cases. Long-term response to treatment can stop the disease from getting worse and may even reverse some damage to the liver.
                
Medications
                
People with autoimmune hepatitis who have no symptoms or a mild form of the disease may or may not need to take medication. A health care provider will determine if a person needs treatment. In some people with mild autoimmune hepatitis, the disease may go into remission. Remission is a period when a person is symptom-free and blood tests and liver biopsy show improvement in liver function.
                
Corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are medications that decrease swelling and reduce the activity of the immune system. Health care providers treat both types of autoimmune hepatitis with a daily dose of a corticosteroid called prednisone. Treatment may begin with a high dose that is gradually lowered as the disease is controlled. The treatment goal is to find the lowest possible dose that helps control the disease.
                
Side effects of prednisone may include
                
- weight gain  - weakness of the bones, called osteoporosis or osteomalacia  - thinning of the hair and skin  - acne  - diabetes  - high blood pressure  - cataracts, a clouding in the lens of the eyes  - glaucoma, elevated pressure in the eyes  - anxiety and confusion
                
A health care provider will closely monitor and manage any side effects that may occur, as high doses of prednisone are often prescribed to treat autoimmune hepatitis.
                
Immune system suppressors. Medications that suppress the immune system prevent the body from making autoantibodies and block the immune reaction that contributes to inflammation. In most cases, health care providers use azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran) in conjunction with prednisone to treat autoimmune hepatitis. When using azathioprine, a health care provider can use a lower dose of prednisone, which may reduce prednisone's side effects.
                
Side effects of azathioprine include
                
- low white blood cell count  - nausea  - vomiting  - skin rash  - liver damage  - pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas
                
Azathioprine is an immune system suppressor, so people taking the medication should undergo routine blood tests to monitor their white blood cell counts. A low white blood cell count can lead to bone marrow failure. Bone marrow is the tissue found inside bones that produces new blood cells, including platelets. A health care provider will also check the platelet count when blood tests are done.
                
A person may need to discontinue prednisone or azathioprine if they cause severe side effects. The risk of side effects is higher in people who also have cirrhosis.
                
A health care provider may gradually reduce the dose of medication in people who show improvement, although the symptoms can return. When a person discontinues treatment, a health care provider will perform routine blood tests and carefully monitor the person's condition for a return of symptoms. Treatment with low doses of prednisone or azathioprine may be necessary on and off for many years.
                
People who do not respond to standard immune therapy or who have severe side effects from the medications may benefit from other immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept), cyclosporine, or tacrolimus (Hecoria, Prograf).
                
Medications that suppress the immune system may lead to various forms of cancer. People on low doses of azathioprine for long periods of time are at slight risk of developing cancer.
                
Liver Transplant
                
In some people, autoimmune hepatitis progresses to cirrhosis and end-stage liver failure, and a liver transplant may be necessary. Symptoms of cirrhosis and liver failure include the symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis and
                
- generalized itching  - a longer-than-usual amount of time for bleeding to stop  - easy bruising  - a swollen stomach or swollen ankles  - spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, that develop on the skin  - abdominal bloating due to an enlarged liver  - fluid in the abdomenalso called ascites  - forgetfulness or confusion
                
Liver transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or an injured liver and replace it with a healthy one from another person, called a donor. A team of surgeons performs a liver transplant in a hospital. When possible, the patient fasts for 8 hours before the surgery. The patient stays in the hospital about 1 to 2 weeks to be sure the transplanted liver is functioning properly. The health care provider will monitor the patient for bleeding, infections, and signs of liver rejection. The patient will take prescription medications long term to prevent infections and rejection. Liver transplant surgery for autoimmune hepatitis is successful in most cases.

Answer: Your body's immune system protects you from disease and infection. But if you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Autoimmune diseases can affect many parts of the body.    No one is sure what causes autoimmune diseases. They do tend to run in families. Women - particularly African-American, Hispanic-American, and Native-American women - have a higher risk for some autoimmune diseases.    There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases, and some have similar symptoms. This makes it hard for your health care provider to know if you really have one of these diseases, and if so, which one. Getting a diagnosis can be frustrating and stressful. Often, the first symptoms are fatigue, muscle aches and a low fever. The classic sign of an autoimmune disease is inflammation, which can cause redness, heat, pain and swelling.    The diseases may also have flare-ups, when they get worse, and remissions, when symptoms get better or disappear. Treatment depends on the disease, but in most cases one important goal is to reduce inflammation. Sometimes doctors prescribe corticosteroids or other drugs that reduce your immune response.)

Answer: People with autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis are at risk of developing liver cancer. A health care provider will monitor the person with a regular ultrasound examination of the liver. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care provider's office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images; anesthesia is not needed.

Causes : An excessive volume of urination for an adult is more than 2.5 liters of urine per day. However, this can vary depending on how much water you drink and what your total body water is.This problem is different from needing to urinate often.  Polyuria is a fairly common symptom. People often notice the problem when they have to get up during the night to use the bathroom (nocturia).  Some common causes of the problems are:  - Diabetes insipidus  - Diabetes mellitus  - Drinking excessive amounts of water   Less common causes include:   - Kidney failure  - Medicines such as diuretics and lithium  - High or low calcium level in the body  - Drinking alcohol and caffeine  - Sickle cell anemia   Also, your urine production may increase for 24 hours after having tests that involve injecting a special dye (contrast medium) into your vein during imaging tests such as a CT scan or an MRI scan.

Home Care : To monitor your urine output, keep a daily record of the following:  - How much you drink  - How often you urinate and how much urine you produce each time  - How much you weigh (use the same scale every day)

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Call your health care provider if you have excessive urination over several days, and it is not explained by medicines you take or drinking more fluids.

What to Expect at Your Office Visit : Your provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions such as:   - When did the problem start and has it changed over time?  - How often do you urinate? Do you get up at night to urinate?  - Do you have problems controlling your urine?  - What makes the problem worse? Better?  - Have you noticed any blood in your urine or change in urine color?  - Do you have any other symptoms (such as pain, burning, fever, or abdominal pain)?  - Do you have a history of diabetes, kidney disease, or urinary infections?  - What medicines do you take?   - How much salt do you eat? Do you drink alcohol and caffeine?   Tests that may be done include:  - Blood sugar (glucose) test  - Blood urea nitrogen test  - Creatinine (serum)  - Electrolytes (serum)  - Fluid deprivation test (limiting fluids to see if the urine volume decreases)  - Osmolality blood test  - Urinalysis  - Urine osmolality test)

GHR_0000313_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome ? (Also called: EDS; Ehlers Danlos disease)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ehlers-danlos-syndrome
Answer: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. Defects in connective tissues cause the signs and symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which vary from mildly loose joints to life-threatening complications.  Previously, there were more than 10 recognized types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, differentiated by Roman numerals. In 1997, researchers proposed a simpler classification that reduced the number of major types to six and gave them descriptive names: the classical type (formerly types I and II), the hypermobility type (formerly type III), the vascular type (formerly type IV), the kyphoscoliosis type (formerly type VIA), the arthrochalasia type (formerly types VIIA and VIIB), and the dermatosparaxis type (formerly type VIIC). This six-type classification, known as the Villefranche nomenclature, is still commonly used. The types are distinguished by their signs and symptoms, their underlying genetic causes, and their patterns of inheritance. Since 1997, several additional forms of the condition have been described. These additional forms appear to be rare, affecting a small number of families, and most have not been well characterized.  Although all types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome affect the joints and skin, additional features vary by type. An unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility) occurs with most forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, particularly the hypermobility type. Infants with hypermobile joints often have weak muscle tone, which can delay the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. The loose joints are unstable and prone to dislocation and chronic pain. Hypermobility and dislocations of both hips at birth are characteristic features in infants with the arthrochalasia type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  Many people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have soft, velvety skin that is highly stretchy (elastic) and fragile. Affected individuals tend to bruise easily, and some types of the condition also cause abnormal scarring. People with the classical form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome experience wounds that split open with little bleeding and leave scars that widen over time to create characteristic ""cigarette paper"" scars. The dermatosparaxis type of the disorder is characterized by skin that sags and wrinkles. Extra (redundant) folds of skin may be present as affected children get older.  Some forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, notably the vascular type and to a lesser extent the kyphoscoliosis and classical types, can involve serious and potentially life-threatening complications due to unpredictable tearing (rupture) of blood vessels. This rupture can cause internal bleeding, stroke, and shock. The vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is also associated with an increased risk of organ rupture, including tearing of the intestine and rupture of the uterus (womb) during pregnancy. People with the kyphoscoliosis form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome experience severe, progressive curvature of the spine that can interfere with breathing.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ehlers-danlos-syndrome
Answer: Although it is difficult to estimate the overall frequency of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the combined prevalence of all types of this condition may be about 1 in 5,000 individuals worldwide. The hypermobility and classical forms are most common; the hypermobility type may affect as many as 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 people, while the classical type probably occurs in 1 in 20,000 to 40,000 people.  Other forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are very rare. About 30 cases of the arthrochalasia type and about 60 cases of the kyphoscoliosis type have been reported worldwide. About a dozen infants and children with the dermatosparaxis type have been described. The vascular type is also rare; estimates vary widely, but the condition may affect about 1 in 250,000 people.)

GHR_0000313_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome ? (Also called: EDS; Ehlers Danlos disease)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ehlers-danlos-syndrome
Answer: Mutations in more than a dozen genes have been found to cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The classical type results most often from mutations in either the COL5A1 gene or the COL5A2 gene. Mutations in the TNXB gene have been found in a very small percentage of cases of the hypermobility type (although in most cases, the cause of this type is unknown). The vascular type results from mutations in the COL3A1 gene. PLOD1 gene mutations cause the kyphoscoliosis type. Mutations in the COL1A1 gene or the COL1A2 gene result in the arthrochalasia type. The dermatosparaxis type is caused by mutations in the ADAMTS2 gene. The other, less well-characterized forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome result from mutations in other genes, some of which have not been identified.  Some of the genes associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, including COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, and COL5A2, provide instructions for making pieces of several different types of collagen. These pieces assemble to form mature collagen molecules that give structure and strength to connective tissues throughout the body. Other genes, including ADAMTS2, PLOD1, and TNXB, provide instructions for making proteins that process or interact with collagen. Mutations that cause the different forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome disrupt the production or processing of collagen, preventing these molecules from being assembled properly. These defects weaken connective tissues in the skin, bones, and other parts of the body, resulting in the characteristic features of this condition.)

GHR_0000313_Sec4.txt,"Question: Is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome inherited ? (Also called: EDS; Ehlers Danlos disease)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ehlers-danlos-syndrome
Answer: The inheritance pattern of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome varies by type. The arthrochalasia, classical, hypermobility, and vascular forms of the disorder have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new (sporadic) gene mutations and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  The dermatosparaxis and kyphoscoliosis types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, as well as some of the rare, less well-characterized types of the disorder, are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In autosomal recessive inheritance, two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder.)

NIDDK_0000027_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Causes of Diabetes ?
URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/causes-diabetes/Pages/index.aspx
Answer: Type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. In type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells. In type 1 diabetes, beta cell destruction may take place over several years, but symptoms of the disease usually develop over a short period of time.
                
Type 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, though it can appear at any age. In the past, type 1 diabetes was called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
                
Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) may be a slowly developing kind of type 1 diabetes. Diagnosis usually occurs after age 30. In LADA, as in type 1 diabetes, the bodys immune system destroys the beta cells. At the time of diagnosis, people with LADA may still produce their own insulin, but eventually most will need insulin shots or an insulin pump to control blood glucose levels.
                
Genetic Susceptibility
                
Heredity plays an important part in determining who is likely to develop type 1 diabetes. Genes are passed down from biological parent to child. Genes carry instructions for making proteins that are needed for the bodys cells to function. Many genes, as well as interactions among genes, are thought to influence susceptibility to and protection from type 1 diabetes. The key genes may vary in different population groups. Variations in genes that affect more than 1 percent of a population group are called gene variants.
                
Certain gene variants that carry instructions for making proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) on white blood cells are linked to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The proteins produced by HLA genes help determine whether the immune system recognizes a cell as part of the body or as foreign material. Some combinations of HLA gene variants predict that a person will be at higher risk for type 1 diabetes, while other combinations are protective or have no effect on risk.
                
While HLA genes are the major risk genes for type 1 diabetes, many additional risk genes or gene regions have been found. Not only can these genes help identify people at risk for type 1 diabetes, but they also provide important clues to help scientists better understand how the disease develops and identify potential targets for therapy and prevention.
                
Genetic testing can show what types of HLA genes a person carries and can reveal other genes linked to diabetes. However, most genetic testing is done in a research setting and is not yet available to individuals. Scientists are studying how the results of genetic testing can be used to improve type 1 diabetes prevention or treatment.
                
Autoimmune Destruction of Beta Cells
                
In type 1 diabetes, white blood cells called T cells attack and destroy beta cells. The process begins well before diabetes symptoms appear and continues after diagnosis. Often, type 1 diabetes is not diagnosed until most beta cells have already been destroyed. At this point, a person needs daily insulin treatment to survive. Finding ways to modify or stop this autoimmune process and preserve beta cell function is a major focus of current scientific research.
                
Recent research suggests insulin itself may be a key trigger of the immune attack on beta cells. The immune systems of people who are susceptible to developing type 1 diabetes respond to insulin as if it were a foreign substance, or antigen. To combat antigens, the body makes proteins called antibodies. Antibodies to insulin and other proteins produced by beta cells are found in people with type 1 diabetes. Researchers test for these antibodies to help identify people at increased risk of developing the disease. Testing the types and levels of antibodies in the blood can help determine whether a person has type 1 diabetes, LADA, or another type of diabetes.
                
Environmental Factors
                
Environmental factors, such as foods, viruses, and toxins, may play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes, but the exact nature of their role has not been determined. Some theories suggest that environmental factors trigger the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in people with a genetic susceptibility to diabetes. Other theories suggest that environmental factors play an ongoing role in diabetes, even after diagnosis.
                
Viruses and infections. A virus cannot cause diabetes on its own, but people are sometimes diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during or after a viral infection, suggesting a link between the two. Also, the onset of type 1 diabetes occurs more frequently during the winter when viral infections are more common. Viruses possibly associated with type 1 diabetes include coxsackievirus B, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, rubella, and mumps. Scientists have described several ways these viruses may damage or destroy beta cells or possibly trigger an autoimmune response in susceptible people. For example, anti-islet antibodies have been found in patients with congenital rubella syndrome, and cytomegalovirus has been associated with significant beta cell damage and acute pancreatitisinflammation of the pancreas. Scientists are trying to identify a virus that can cause type 1 diabetes so that a vaccine might be developed to prevent the disease.
                
Infant feeding practices. Some studies have suggested that dietary factors may raise or lower the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. For example, breastfed infants and infants receiving vitamin D supplements may have a reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes, while early exposure to cows milk and cereal proteins may increase risk. More research is needed to clarify how infant nutrition affects the risk for type 1 diabetes.

NIDDK_0000027_Sec3.txt,"Question: What causes Causes of Diabetes ?
URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/causes-diabetes/Pages/index.aspx
Answer: Type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes may develop gradually and can be subtle; some people with type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed for years.
                
Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people who are also overweight or obese. The disease, once rare in youth, is becoming more common in overweight and obese children and adolescents. Scientists think genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are the most likely triggers of type 2 diabetes.
                
Genetic Susceptibility
                
Genes play a significant part in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease a persons risk for developing the disease. The role of genes is suggested by the high rate of type 2 diabetes in families and identical twins and wide variations in diabetes prevalence by ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes occurs more frequently in African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanics/Latinos, and some Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islander Americans than it does in non-Hispanic whites.
                
Recent studies have combined genetic data from large numbers of people, accelerating the pace of gene discovery. Though scientists have now identified many gene variants that increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, the majority have yet to be discovered. The known genes appear to affect insulin production rather than insulin resistance. Researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to learn how they interact with one another and with environmental factors to cause diabetes.
                
Studies have shown that variants of the TCF7L2 gene increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. For people who inherit two copies of the variants, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is about 80 percent higher than for those who do not carry the gene variant.1 However, even in those with the variant, diet and physical activity leading to weight loss help delay diabetes, according to the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a major clinical trial involving people at high risk.
                
Genes can also increase the risk of diabetes by increasing a persons tendency to become overweight or obese. One theory, known as the thrifty gene hypothesis, suggests certain genes increase the efficiency of metabolism to extract energy from food and store the energy for later use. This survival trait was advantageous for populations whose food supplies were scarce or unpredictable and could help keep people alive during famine. In modern times, however, when high-calorie foods are plentiful, such a trait can promote obesity and type 2 diabetes.
                
Obesity and Physical Inactivity
                
Physical inactivity and obesity are strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. People who are genetically susceptible to type 2 diabetes are more vulnerable when these risk factors are present.
                
An imbalance between caloric intake and physical activity can lead to obesity, which causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. Central obesity, in which a person has excess abdominal fat, is a major risk factor not only for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes but also for heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease (CVD). This excess belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause harmful, chronic effects in the body such as damage to blood vessels.
                
The DPP and other studies show that millions of people can lower their risk for type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes and losing weight. The DPP proved that people with prediabetesat high risk of developing type 2 diabetescould sharply lower their risk by losing weight through regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories. In 2009, a follow-up study of DPP participantsthe Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS)showed that the benefits of weight loss lasted for at least 10 years after the original study began.2
                
Read more about the DPP, funded under National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trial number NCT00004992, and the DPPOS, funded under NIH clinical trial number NCT00038727 in  Diabetes Prevention Program.
                
Insulin Resistance
                
Insulin resistance is a common condition in people who are overweight or obese, have excess abdominal fat, and are not physically active. Muscle, fat, and liver cells stop responding properly to insulin, forcing the pancreas to compensate by producing extra insulin. As long as beta cells are able to produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels stay in the normal range. But when insulin production falters because of beta cell dysfunction, glucose levels rise, leading to prediabetes or diabetes.
                
Abnormal Glucose Production by the Liver
                
In some people with diabetes, an abnormal increase in glucose production by the liver also contributes to high blood glucose levels. Normally, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon when blood glucose and insulin levels are low. Glucagon stimulates the liver to produce glucose and release it into the bloodstream. But when blood glucose and insulin levels are high after a meal, glucagon levels drop, and the liver stores excess glucose for later, when it is needed. For reasons not completely understood, in many people with diabetes, glucagon levels stay higher than needed. High glucagon levels cause the liver to produce unneeded glucose, which contributes to high blood glucose levels. Metformin, the most commonly used drug to treat type 2 diabetes, reduces glucose production by the liver.
                
The Roles of Insulin and Glucagon in Normal Blood Glucose Regulation
                
A healthy persons body keeps blood glucose levels in a normal range through several complex mechanisms. Insulin and glucagon, two hormones made in the pancreas, help regulate blood glucose levels:
                
- Insulin, made by beta cells, lowers elevated blood glucose levels.  - Glucagon, made by alpha cells, raises low blood glucose levels.
                
- Insulin helps muscle, fat, and liver cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood glucose levels.  - Insulin stimulates the liver and muscle tissue to store excess glucose. The stored form of glucose is called glycogen.  - Insulin also lowers blood glucose levels by reducing glucose production in the liver.
                
- Glucagon signals the liver and muscle tissue to break down glycogen into glucose, which enters the bloodstream and raises blood glucose levels.  - If the body needs more glucose, glucagon stimulates the liver to make glucose from amino acids.
                
Metabolic Syndrome
                
Metabolic syndrome, also called insulin resistance syndrome, refers to a group of conditions common in people with insulin resistance, including
                
- higher than normal blood glucose levels  - increased waist size due to excess abdominal fat  - high blood pressure  - abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood
                
Cell Signaling and Regulation
                
Cells communicate through a complex network of molecular signaling pathways. For example, on cell surfaces, insulin receptor molecules capture, or bind, insulin molecules circulating in the bloodstream. This interaction between insulin and its receptor prompts the biochemical signals that enable the cells to absorb glucose from the blood and use it for energy.
                
Problems in cell signaling systems can set off a chain reaction that leads to diabetes or other diseases. Many studies have focused on how insulin signals cells to communicate and regulate action. Researchers have identified proteins and pathways that transmit the insulin signal and have mapped interactions between insulin and body tissues, including the way insulin helps the liver control blood glucose levels. Researchers have also found that key signals also come from fat cells, which produce substances that cause inflammation and insulin resistance.
                
This work holds the key to combating insulin resistance and diabetes. As scientists learn more about cell signaling systems involved in glucose regulation, they will have more opportunities to develop effective treatments.
                
Beta Cell Dysfunction
                
Scientists think beta cell dysfunction is a key contributor to type 2 diabetes. Beta cell impairment can cause inadequate or abnormal patterns of insulin release. Also, beta cells may be damaged by high blood glucose itself, a condition called glucose toxicity.
                
Scientists have not determined the causes of beta cell dysfunction in most cases. Single gene defects lead to specific forms of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The genes involved regulate insulin production in the beta cells. Although these forms of diabetes are rare, they provide clues as to how beta cell function may be affected by key regulatory factors. Other gene variants are involved in determining the number and function of beta cells. But these variants account for only a small percentage of type 2 diabetes cases. Malnutrition early in life is also being investigated as a cause of beta cell dysfunction. The metabolic environment of the developing fetus may also create a predisposition for diabetes later in life.
                
Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes
                
People who develop type 2 diabetes are more likely to have the following characteristics:
                
- age 45 or older  - overweight or obese  - physically inactive  - parent or sibling with diabetes  - family background that is African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander American  - history of giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds  - history of gestational diabetes  - high blood pressure140/90 or aboveor being treated for high blood pressure  - high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good, cholesterol below 35 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or a triglyceride level above 250 mg/dL  - polycystic ovary syndrome, also called PCOS  - prediabetesan A1C level of 5.7 to 6.4 percent; a fasting plasma glucose test result of 100125 mg/dL, called impaired fasting glucose; or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test result of 140199, called impaired glucose tolerance  - acanthosis nigricans, a condition associated with insulin resistance, characterized by a dark, velvety rash around the neck or armpits  - history of CVD
                
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that testing to detect prediabetes and type 2 diabetes be considered in adults who are overweight or obese and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. In adults without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45.)

NIDDK_0000027_Sec4.txt,"Question: What causes Causes of Diabetes ?
URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/causes-diabetes/Pages/index.aspx
Answer: Insulin Resistance and Beta Cell Dysfunction
                
Hormones produced by the placenta and other pregnancy-related factors contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Insulin resistance increases the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels. If the pancreas cant produce enough insulin due to beta cell dysfunction, gestational diabetes occurs.
                
As with type 2 diabetes, excess weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Overweight or obese women are at particularly high risk for gestational diabetes because they start pregnancy with a higher need for insulin due to insulin resistance. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy may also increase risk.
                
Family History
                
Having a family history of diabetes is also a risk factor for gestational diabetes, suggesting that genes play a role in its development. Genetics may also explain why the disorder occurs more frequently in African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanics/Latinos. Many gene variants or combinations of variants may increase a womans risk for developing gestational diabetes. Studies have found several gene variants associated with gestational diabetes, but these variants account for only a small fraction of women with gestational diabetes.
                
Future Risk of Type 2 Diabetes
                
Because a womans hormones usually return to normal levels soon after giving birth, gestational diabetes disappears in most women after delivery. However, women who have gestational diabetes are more likely to develop gestational diabetes with future pregnancies and develop type 2 diabetes.3 Women with gestational diabetes should be tested for persistent diabetes 6 to 12 weeks after delivery and at least every 3 years thereafter.
                
Also, exposure to high glucose levels during gestation increases a childs risk for becoming overweight or obese and for developing type 2 diabetes later on. The result may be a cycle of diabetes affecting multiple generations in a family. For both mother and child, maintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active may help prevent type 2 diabetes.)

Answer: Other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes.
                
Genetic Mutations Affecting Beta Cells, Insulin, and Insulin Action
                
Some relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin.
                
The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and MODY. NDM occurs in the first 6 months of life. MODY is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. More information about NDM and MODY is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Monogenic Forms of Diabetes.
                
Other rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors.
                
Other Genetic Diseases
                
Diabetes occurs in people with Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. Scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes.
                
The genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. Cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. The risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.
                
Damage to or Removal of the Pancreas
                
Pancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.
                
Endocrine Diseases
                
Endocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. Cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. Cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. The tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. Hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels.
                
Autoimmune Disorders
                
Rare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. This kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. Another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes.
                
Medications and Chemical Toxins
                
Some medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. Pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. Also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. Glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis.
                
Many chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. For example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam Warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. In 2000, based on a report from the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which Vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. Some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. Arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes.
                
Lipodystrophy
                
Lipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body. The condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.)

Answer: Type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. In type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells. In type 1 diabetes, beta cell destruction may take place over several years, but symptoms of the disease usually develop over a short period of time.
                
Type 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, though it can appear at any age. In the past, type 1 diabetes was called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
                
Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) may be a slowly developing kind of type 1 diabetes. Diagnosis usually occurs after age 30. In LADA, as in type 1 diabetes, the bodys immune system destroys the beta cells. At the time of diagnosis, people with LADA may still produce their own insulin, but eventually most will need insulin shots or an insulin pump to control blood glucose levels.
                
Genetic Susceptibility
                
Heredity plays an important part in determining who is likely to develop type 1 diabetes. Genes are passed down from biological parent to child. Genes carry instructions for making proteins that are needed for the bodys cells to function. Many genes, as well as interactions among genes, are thought to influence susceptibility to and protection from type 1 diabetes. The key genes may vary in different population groups. Variations in genes that affect more than 1 percent of a population group are called gene variants.
                
Certain gene variants that carry instructions for making proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) on white blood cells are linked to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The proteins produced by HLA genes help determine whether the immune system recognizes a cell as part of the body or as foreign material. Some combinations of HLA gene variants predict that a person will be at higher risk for type 1 diabetes, while other combinations are protective or have no effect on risk.
                
While HLA genes are the major risk genes for type 1 diabetes, many additional risk genes or gene regions have been found. Not only can these genes help identify people at risk for type 1 diabetes, but they also provide important clues to help scientists better understand how the disease develops and identify potential targets for therapy and prevention.
                
Genetic testing can show what types of HLA genes a person carries and can reveal other genes linked to diabetes. However, most genetic testing is done in a research setting and is not yet available to individuals. Scientists are studying how the results of genetic testing can be used to improve type 1 diabetes prevention or treatment.
                
Autoimmune Destruction of Beta Cells
                
In type 1 diabetes, white blood cells called T cells attack and destroy beta cells. The process begins well before diabetes symptoms appear and continues after diagnosis. Often, type 1 diabetes is not diagnosed until most beta cells have already been destroyed. At this point, a person needs daily insulin treatment to survive. Finding ways to modify or stop this autoimmune process and preserve beta cell function is a major focus of current scientific research.
                
Recent research suggests insulin itself may be a key trigger of the immune attack on beta cells. The immune systems of people who are susceptible to developing type 1 diabetes respond to insulin as if it were a foreign substance, or antigen. To combat antigens, the body makes proteins called antibodies. Antibodies to insulin and other proteins produced by beta cells are found in people with type 1 diabetes. Researchers test for these antibodies to help identify people at increased risk of developing the disease. Testing the types and levels of antibodies in the blood can help determine whether a person has type 1 diabetes, LADA, or another type of diabetes.
                
Environmental Factors
                
Environmental factors, such as foods, viruses, and toxins, may play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes, but the exact nature of their role has not been determined. Some theories suggest that environmental factors trigger the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in people with a genetic susceptibility to diabetes. Other theories suggest that environmental factors play an ongoing role in diabetes, even after diagnosis.
                
Viruses and infections. A virus cannot cause diabetes on its own, but people are sometimes diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during or after a viral infection, suggesting a link between the two. Also, the onset of type 1 diabetes occurs more frequently during the winter when viral infections are more common. Viruses possibly associated with type 1 diabetes include coxsackievirus B, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, rubella, and mumps. Scientists have described several ways these viruses may damage or destroy beta cells or possibly trigger an autoimmune response in susceptible people. For example, anti-islet antibodies have been found in patients with congenital rubella syndrome, and cytomegalovirus has been associated with significant beta cell damage and acute pancreatitisinflammation of the pancreas. Scientists are trying to identify a virus that can cause type 1 diabetes so that a vaccine might be developed to prevent the disease.
                
Infant feeding practices. Some studies have suggested that dietary factors may raise or lower the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. For example, breastfed infants and infants receiving vitamin D supplements may have a reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes, while early exposure to cows milk and cereal proteins may increase risk. More research is needed to clarify how infant nutrition affects the risk for type 1 diabetes.

URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/causes-diabetes/Pages/index.aspx#gestational
Answer: Type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes may develop gradually and can be subtle; some people with type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed for years.
                
Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people who are also overweight or obese. The disease, once rare in youth, is becoming more common in overweight and obese children and adolescents. Scientists think genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are the most likely triggers of type 2 diabetes.
                
Genetic Susceptibility
                
Genes play a significant part in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease a persons risk for developing the disease. The role of genes is suggested by the high rate of type 2 diabetes in families and identical twins and wide variations in diabetes prevalence by ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes occurs more frequently in African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanics/Latinos, and some Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islander Americans than it does in non-Hispanic whites.
                
Recent studies have combined genetic data from large numbers of people, accelerating the pace of gene discovery. Though scientists have now identified many gene variants that increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, the majority have yet to be discovered. The known genes appear to affect insulin production rather than insulin resistance. Researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to learn how they interact with one another and with environmental factors to cause diabetes.
                
Studies have shown that variants of the TCF7L2 gene increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. For people who inherit two copies of the variants, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is about 80 percent higher than for those who do not carry the gene variant.1 However, even in those with the variant, diet and physical activity leading to weight loss help delay diabetes, according to the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a major clinical trial involving people at high risk.
                
Genes can also increase the risk of diabetes by increasing a persons tendency to become overweight or obese. One theory, known as the thrifty gene hypothesis, suggests certain genes increase the efficiency of metabolism to extract energy from food and store the energy for later use. This survival trait was advantageous for populations whose food supplies were scarce or unpredictable and could help keep people alive during famine. In modern times, however, when high-calorie foods are plentiful, such a trait can promote obesity and type 2 diabetes.
                
Obesity and Physical Inactivity
                
Physical inactivity and obesity are strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. People who are genetically susceptible to type 2 diabetes are more vulnerable when these risk factors are present.
                
An imbalance between caloric intake and physical activity can lead to obesity, which causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. Central obesity, in which a person has excess abdominal fat, is a major risk factor not only for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes but also for heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease (CVD). This excess belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause harmful, chronic effects in the body such as damage to blood vessels.
                
The DPP and other studies show that millions of people can lower their risk for type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes and losing weight. The DPP proved that people with prediabetesat high risk of developing type 2 diabetescould sharply lower their risk by losing weight through regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories. In 2009, a follow-up study of DPP participantsthe Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS)showed that the benefits of weight loss lasted for at least 10 years after the original study began.2
                
Read more about the DPP, funded under National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trial number NCT00004992, and the DPPOS, funded under NIH clinical trial number NCT00038727 in  Diabetes Prevention Program.
                
Insulin Resistance
                
Insulin resistance is a common condition in people who are overweight or obese, have excess abdominal fat, and are not physically active. Muscle, fat, and liver cells stop responding properly to insulin, forcing the pancreas to compensate by producing extra insulin. As long as beta cells are able to produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels stay in the normal range. But when insulin production falters because of beta cell dysfunction, glucose levels rise, leading to prediabetes or diabetes.
                
Abnormal Glucose Production by the Liver
                
In some people with diabetes, an abnormal increase in glucose production by the liver also contributes to high blood glucose levels. Normally, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon when blood glucose and insulin levels are low. Glucagon stimulates the liver to produce glucose and release it into the bloodstream. But when blood glucose and insulin levels are high after a meal, glucagon levels drop, and the liver stores excess glucose for later, when it is needed. For reasons not completely understood, in many people with diabetes, glucagon levels stay higher than needed. High glucagon levels cause the liver to produce unneeded glucose, which contributes to high blood glucose levels. Metformin, the most commonly used drug to treat type 2 diabetes, reduces glucose production by the liver.
                
The Roles of Insulin and Glucagon in Normal Blood Glucose Regulation
                
A healthy persons body keeps blood glucose levels in a normal range through several complex mechanisms. Insulin and glucagon, two hormones made in the pancreas, help regulate blood glucose levels:
                
- Insulin, made by beta cells, lowers elevated blood glucose levels.  - Glucagon, made by alpha cells, raises low blood glucose levels.
                
- Insulin helps muscle, fat, and liver cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood glucose levels.  - Insulin stimulates the liver and muscle tissue to store excess glucose. The stored form of glucose is called glycogen.  - Insulin also lowers blood glucose levels by reducing glucose production in the liver.
                
- Glucagon signals the liver and muscle tissue to break down glycogen into glucose, which enters the bloodstream and raises blood glucose levels.  - If the body needs more glucose, glucagon stimulates the liver to make glucose from amino acids.
                
Metabolic Syndrome
                
Metabolic syndrome, also called insulin resistance syndrome, refers to a group of conditions common in people with insulin resistance, including
                
- higher than normal blood glucose levels  - increased waist size due to excess abdominal fat  - high blood pressure  - abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood
                
Cell Signaling and Regulation
                
Cells communicate through a complex network of molecular signaling pathways. For example, on cell surfaces, insulin receptor molecules capture, or bind, insulin molecules circulating in the bloodstream. This interaction between insulin and its receptor prompts the biochemical signals that enable the cells to absorb glucose from the blood and use it for energy.
                
Problems in cell signaling systems can set off a chain reaction that leads to diabetes or other diseases. Many studies have focused on how insulin signals cells to communicate and regulate action. Researchers have identified proteins and pathways that transmit the insulin signal and have mapped interactions between insulin and body tissues, including the way insulin helps the liver control blood glucose levels. Researchers have also found that key signals also come from fat cells, which produce substances that cause inflammation and insulin resistance.
                
This work holds the key to combating insulin resistance and diabetes. As scientists learn more about cell signaling systems involved in glucose regulation, they will have more opportunities to develop effective treatments.
                
Beta Cell Dysfunction
                
Scientists think beta cell dysfunction is a key contributor to type 2 diabetes. Beta cell impairment can cause inadequate or abnormal patterns of insulin release. Also, beta cells may be damaged by high blood glucose itself, a condition called glucose toxicity.
                
Scientists have not determined the causes of beta cell dysfunction in most cases. Single gene defects lead to specific forms of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The genes involved regulate insulin production in the beta cells. Although these forms of diabetes are rare, they provide clues as to how beta cell function may be affected by key regulatory factors. Other gene variants are involved in determining the number and function of beta cells. But these variants account for only a small percentage of type 2 diabetes cases. Malnutrition early in life is also being investigated as a cause of beta cell dysfunction. The metabolic environment of the developing fetus may also create a predisposition for diabetes later in life.
                
Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes
                
People who develop type 2 diabetes are more likely to have the following characteristics:
                
- age 45 or older  - overweight or obese  - physically inactive  - parent or sibling with diabetes  - family background that is African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander American  - history of giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds  - history of gestational diabetes  - high blood pressure140/90 or aboveor being treated for high blood pressure  - high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good, cholesterol below 35 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or a triglyceride level above 250 mg/dL  - polycystic ovary syndrome, also called PCOS  - prediabetesan A1C level of 5.7 to 6.4 percent; a fasting plasma glucose test result of 100125 mg/dL, called impaired fasting glucose; or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test result of 140199, called impaired glucose tolerance  - acanthosis nigricans, a condition associated with insulin resistance, characterized by a dark, velvety rash around the neck or armpits  - history of CVD
                
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that testing to detect prediabetes and type 2 diabetes be considered in adults who are overweight or obese and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. In adults without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45.)

Answer: Other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes.
                
Genetic Mutations Affecting Beta Cells, Insulin, and Insulin Action
                
Some relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin.
                
The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and MODY. NDM occurs in the first 6 months of life. MODY is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. More information about NDM and MODY is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Monogenic Forms of Diabetes.
                
Other rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors.
                
Other Genetic Diseases
                
Diabetes occurs in people with Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. Scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes.
                
The genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. Cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. The risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.
                
Damage to or Removal of the Pancreas
                
Pancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.
                
Endocrine Diseases
                
Endocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. Cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. Cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. The tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. Hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels.
                
Autoimmune Disorders
                
Rare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. This kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. Another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes.
                
Medications and Chemical Toxins
                
Some medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. Pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. Also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. Glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis.
                
Many chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. For example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam Warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. In 2000, based on a report from the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which Vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. Some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes.

Answer: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common type of male sexual dysfunction. It is when a man has trouble getting or keeping an erection. ED becomes more common as you get older. But it's not a natural part of aging.    Some people have trouble speaking with their doctors about sex. But if you have ED, you should tell your doctor. ED can be a sign of health problems. It may mean your blood vessels are clogged. It may mean you have nerve damage from diabetes. If you don't see your doctor, these problems will go untreated.     Your doctor can offer several new treatments for ED. For many men, the answer is as simple as taking a pill. Getting more exercise, losing weight, or stopping smoking may also help.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000798.htm
Answer: When a medicine is not taken in the way it is meant to be used and a person is addicted to it, the problem is called prescription drug use disorder. Persons who have this disorder take the drugs because the chemicals in the medicines have psychoactive effects. Psychoactive means having an effect on the way the brain functions. In short, the drugs are used to get high.)

Answer: Treatment begins with recognizing there is aproblem. Once you decide you want to do something about your drug use, the next step is to get help and support.  Treatment programs use behavior modification techniques through counseling (talk therapy). The techniques get you to understand your behaviors and why you use drugs. Involving family and friends during counseling can help support you keep you from going back to using (relapsing).  With some drug addictions, such as opioids, medicines may also be used to help reduce the effects of opioids on the brain. Other medicines may be used to lessen cravings and withdrawal symptoms.  If you have severe withdrawal symptoms, you may need to stay at a residential treatment program. There, your health and safety can be monitored as you recover.)

Answer: Summary : Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are drugs you can buy without a prescription. Some OTC medicines relieve aches, pains and itches. Some prevent or cure diseases, like tooth decay and athlete's foot. Others help manage recurring problems, like migraines.      In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration decides whether a medicine is safe enough to sell over-the-counter. Taking OTC medicines still has risks. Some interact with other medicines, supplements, foods or drinks. Others cause problems for people with certain medical conditions. If you're pregnant, talk to your health care provider before taking any medicines.     It is important to take medicines correctly, and be careful when giving them to children. More medicine does not necessarily mean better. You should never take OTC medicines longer or in higher doses than the label recommends.

NIHSeniorHealth_0000055_Sec6.txt,"Question: What causes Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?

Answer: Medications affect older people differently than younger people because aging changes how the body and brain handle these substances. As we age, our bodies change and cannot break down and get rid of substances as easily as before. This means that even a small amount of a medicine or a drug can have a strong effect. If you take medications the wrong way or abuse illicit drugs, this can have a serious effect on your health and make existing health problems worse. As people age, they may also become more sensitive to alcohols effects. For more information on the dangers of mixing alcohol and medicines, see Alcohol Use and Older Adults."")

ADAM_0001438_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Erection problems - aftercare (Also called: Erectile dysfunction - self-care)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000396.htm
Answer: Summary : You have seen your health care provider for erection problems. You may be unable to get an erection at all. Or you may prematurely lose the erection during intercourse. If the condition persists, the medical term for this problem is erectile dysfunction (ED).  Erection problems are common in adult men. In fact, almost all men have a problem getting or maintaining an erection at times.

Lifestyle : For many men, lifestyle changes can help with ED. For example, alcohol and illegal drugs may make you feel more relaxed. But they can cause ED or make it worse. Avoid illegal drugs, and consider limiting the amount of alcohol you drink.  Smoking and smokeless tobacco can cause narrowing of blood vessels all over the body, including those that supply blood to the penis. Talk to your provider about quitting.  Other lifestyle tips include:  - Get plenty of rest and take time to relax.  - Exercise and eat healthy foods to maintain good circulation.  - Use safe sex practices. Reducing your worry about STDs may help prevent negative emotions that can affect your erection.  - Talk with your provider and review your daily prescription medicine list. Many prescription medicines can cause or worsen ED.

Talking With Your Partner : Having ED can make you feel bad about yourself. This can make it even more difficult to seek treatment and enjoy sexual activity.  ED can be a troubling issue for couples, because it can be difficult for you or your partner to discuss the problem with each other. Couples who do not openly talk to each other are more likely to have problems with sexual intimacy. Likewise, men who have trouble talking about their feelings may be unable to share their sexual concerns with their partners.  If you have trouble communicating, counseling can be very helpful for you and your partner. Finding a way for both of you to express your feelings and desires, and then work on the issues together, can make a big difference.

Medicines, Herbs, and Supplements : Sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), and tadalafil (Cialis) are medicines prescribed for ED. They cause erections only when you are sexually aroused.  - The effect is most often seen within 15 to 45 minutes. The effects of these drugs may last for several hours. Tadalafil (Cialis) may last for up to 36 hours.  - Sildenafil (Viagra) should be taken on an empty stomach. (Levitra) and tadalafil (Cialis) may be taken with or without food.  - These drugs should not be used more than once a day.  - Common side effects of these medicines include flushing, upset stomach, headache, nasal congestion, back pain, and dizziness.    If you have heart disease, talk with your provider before using these medicines. Men who take nitrates for heart disease should not take ED medications.  Many herbs and dietary supplements are marketed to help sexual performance or desire. None of these remedies have been proven effective for treating ED. Talk to your provider to see if any of these treatments is right for you.

When to Call Your Doctor : Call your health care provider right away or go to an emergency room if any ED medicine gives you an erection that lasts more than 4 hours. If this problem is not treated, you may suffer lasting damage to your penis.  To end an erection you may try to repeat climax and apply a cold pack to your genitalia (wrap the pack in a cloth first). Never go to sleep with an erection.)

URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/urologic-disease/erectile-dysfunction/Pages/ez.aspx
Answer: Erectile dysfunction often has more than one cause. Many diseases can damage nerves, arteries, and muscles. Some can lead to ED, such as
                
- high blood pressure  - diabetes, when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high  - clogged arteries  - heart and blood vessel disease  - chronic kidney disease  - multiple sclerosis, a disease that attacks the nerves  - treatments for prostate cancer, including radiation, surgery to remove the prostate, and hormone treatments  - injury to the penis, spinal cord, prostate, bladder, or pelvis  - surgery for bladder cancer  - Peyronies disease, in which scar tissue, called a plaque, forms in the penis
                
Unhealthy lifestyle choices, such as smoking, drinking too much alcohol, using illegal drugs, being overweight, and not exercising, can lead to ED.
                
Mental health problems such as the following can also cause or worsen ED:
                
- depression  - fear of sexual failure  - guilt  - low self-esteem  - stress  - worry
                
Even when ED has a physical cause, mental health problems can make ED worse. For example, a physical problem may slow your sexual arousal, which may make you more nervous and worsen your ED.
                
In addition, ED can be a side effect of many common medicines. A small number of ED cases result from low testosterone, a male hormone.)

Answer: Having ED can cause you to feel depressed or anxious. ED may also cause low self-esteem. When you have ED, you may not have a satisfying sex life. You may not feel as close with your sexual partner, which may strain your relationship.

ED can be a sign of other health problems, such as diabetes or heart disease.   When you meet with your doctor, you might use phrases like, Ive been having problems in the bedroom or Ive been having erection problems. Remember that a healthy sex life is part of a healthy life. Dont be shy about seeking help. Your doctor treats medical problems every day.   If talking with your doctor doesnt put you at ease, ask for a referral to another doctor. Your doctor may send you to a urologista doctor who specializes in sexual and urinary problems.)

URL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/urologic-disease/erectile-dysfunction/Pages/ez.aspx
Answer: To find the cause of your ED, your doctor may
                
- take your medical and sexual history  - ask you questions about your mental health  - give you a physical exam  - test your blood  - give you a nighttime erection test  - perform an injection test  - perform a Doppler penile ultrasound
                
Medical and Sexual History
                
Your doctor will ask general questions about your health, as well as specific questions about your erection problems and your relationship with your sexual partner. Your doctor might ask you questions such as
                
- Have you ever had surgery?  - What medicines do you take?  - How sure are you that you can get and keep an erection?  - When you have erections, how often are they hard enough for sex?  - During sex, how often are you able to keep your erection?  - When you try to have sex, how often are you happy with the sex?  - How would you rate your level of sexual desire?  - How often are you able to reach climax and ejaculate?  - Do you have an erection when you wake up in the morning?  - Do you use illegal drugs, drink alcohol, or smoke?
                
The answers to these questions will help your doctor understand the problem.
                
Bring a list of all the medicines you take, or the actual medicines, to show to your doctor.
                
Mental Health Questions
                
Your doctor may ask you questions about your mental health. For example, the doctor may ask if you feel nervous or depressed. He or she may also ask you to answer questions on paper. The doctor may also ask your sexual partner questions to get more information about the problem.
                
Physical Exam
                
A physical exam can help your doctor find the cause of your ED. As part of the exam, the doctor will examine your testes and penis, take your blood pressure, and check for problems with your blood flow.
                
Blood Tests
                
A blood test involves drawing your blood at a doctors office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Blood tests can show possible causes of ED, such as diabetes, clogged blood vessels, or chronic kidney disease. Low levels of testosterone in your blood can explain why you may have lost interest in sex.
                
Nighttime Erection Test
                
During a nighttime erection test, you wear a plastic band around your penis to test whether you have nighttime erections. The band easily breaks if your penis expands. This test shows if you had at least one erection during the night. Another test uses an electronic device that can record the number of erections, how long they last, and how firm they are. A man normally has three to five erections during the night while he sleeps. If you do have an erection, it probably means that your ED is more likely a mental health issue. If you do not have these erections, you probably have nerve damage or poor blood flow to your penis. You may do this test in your home or in a special sleep lab.
                
Injection Test
                
During an injection test, the doctor will inject a medicine into your penis to cause an erection. If the erection is not firm or does not last, it may mean you have a problem with blood flow. This test most often takes place in the doctors office.
                
Doppler Penile Ultrasound
                
An x-ray technician most often performs a Doppler penile ultrasound in a doctors office or an outpatient center. During a Doppler penile ultrasound, the x-ray technician or doctor lightly passes a device over your penis to create images of blood vessels in your penis. An injection is used to create an erection. The images can show if you have a blood flow problem. The pictures appear on a computer screen. A radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginglooks at the images to find possible problems.)

Answer: You can prevent many of the causes of ED by making healthy lifestyle choices. Following a healthy diet may help prevent ED. Quitting smoking and getting physical activity are also important ways to prevent ED.
                
Physical activity increases blood flow throughout your body, including your penis. Talk with your doctor before starting new activities.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007617.htm
Answer: Summary : An erection problem occurs when a man cannot get or keep an erection that is firm enough for intercourse. You may not be able to get an erection at all. Or, you may lose the erection during intercourse before you are ready. Erection problems do not usually affect your sex drive.  Erection problems are common. Almost all adult men have trouble getting or keeping an erection at one time or another. Often the problem goes away with little or no treatment. But for some men, it can be an ongoing problem. This is called erectile dysfunction (ED).  If you have trouble getting or keeping an erection more than 25% of the time, you should see your health care provider.

Causes : To get an erection, your brain, nerves, hormones, and blood vessels all need to work together. If something gets in the way of these normal functions, it can lead to erection problems.  An erection problem is usually not ""all in your head."" In fact, most erection problems have a physical cause. Below are some common physical causes.  Disease:  - Diabetes  - High blood pressure  - Heart or thyroid conditions  - Clogged arteries (atherosclerosis)  - Depression  - Nervous system disorders, such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson disease    Medicines:  - Antidepressants  - Blood pressure medicines (especially beta-blockers)  - Heart medicines, such as digoxin  - Sleeping pills  - Some peptic ulcer medicines    Other physical causes:  - Low testosterone levels. This can make it difficult to get an erection. It can also reduce a man's sex drive.  - Nerve damage from prostate surgery  - Nicotine, alcohol, or cocaine use  - Spinal cord injury    In some cases, your emotions or relationship problems can lead to ED, such as:  - Poor communication with your partner  - Feelings of doubt and failure  - Stress, fear, anxiety, or anger  - Expecting too much from sex. This can make sex a task instead of a pleasure.    Erection problems can affect men at any age, but are more common as you get older. Physical causes are more common in older men. Emotional causes are more common in younger men.  If you have erections in the morning or at night while you sleep, it is likely not a physical cause. Most men have 3 to 5 erections at night that last about 30 minutes. Talk with your provider about how to find out if you have normal nighttime erections.

Symptoms : Symptoms may include any of the following:  - Trouble getting an erection  - Trouble keeping an erection  - Having an erection that is not firm enough for intercourse  - Less interest in sex

Exams and Tests : Yourprovider will perform a physical exam, which may include:  - Taking your blood pressure  - Examining your penis and rectum to check for problems    Your provider will also ask questions to help find the cause, such as:  - Have you been able to get and keep erections in the past?  - Are you having trouble getting an erection or keeping erections?  - Do you have erections during sleep or in the morning?  - How long have you had trouble with erections?    Yourprovider will also ask about your lifestyle:  - Are you taking any medicines, including over-the counter medicines and supplements?  - Do you drink, smoke, or use recreational drugs?  - What is your state of mind? Are you stressed, depressed, or anxious?  - Are you having relationship problems?    You may have a number of different tests to help find the cause, such as:  - Urinalysis or blood tests to check for health conditions such as diabetes, heart problems, or low testosterone  - A device you wear at night to check for normal nighttime erections  - Ultrasound of your penis to check for blood flow problems  - Rigidity monitoring to test how strong your erection is  - Psychological tests to check for depression and other emotional problems

Treatment : The treatment may depend on what is causing the problem and how healthy you are. Your provider can talk with you about the best treatment for you.  For many men, lifestyle changes can help. These include:  - Getting exercise  - Eating a healthy diet  - Losing extra weight  - Sleeping well    If you and your partner have trouble talking about your relationship, it may cause problems with sex. Counseling can help both you and your partner.  Lifestyle changes alone may not be enough. There are many treatment options.  - Pills you take by mouth, such as sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), and tadalafil (Cialis). They work only when you are sexually aroused. They usually start to work in 15 to 45 minutes.  - Medicine inserted into the urethra or injected into the penis to improve blood flow. Very small needles are used and do not cause pain.  - Surgery to place implants in the penis. The implants may be inflatable or semi-rigid.  - A vacuum device. This is used to pull blood into the penis. A special rubber band is then used to keep the erection during intercourse.  - Testosterone replacement if your testosterone level is low. This comes in skin patches, gel, or injections into the muscle.    ED pills you take by mouth (Viagra, Levitra, or Cialis) can have side effects. These can range from muscle pain and flushing to heart attack. DO NOT use these drugs with nitroglycerin. The combination can cause your blood pressure to drop.   You may not be able to use these drugs if you have any of the following conditions:  - Recent stroke or heart attack  - Severe heart disease, such as unstable angina or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)  - Severe heart failure  - Uncontrolled high blood pressure  - Uncontrolled diabetes  - Very low blood pressure    Other treatments also have possible side effects and complications. Ask your provider to explain the risks and benefits of each treatment.  You may see many herbs and supplements that claim to help sexual performance or desire. However, none have been proven to successfully treat ED. Plus, they may not always be safe. DO NOT take anything without talking with your provider first.

Outlook (Prognosis) : Many men overcome erection problems with lifestyle changes, medical treatment, or both. For more severe cases, you and your partner may have to adjust to how ED affects your sex life. Even with treatment, counseling can help you and your partner overcome the stress ED may put on your relationship.

Possible Complications : An erection problem that does not go away can make you feel bad about yourself. It can also harm your relationship with your partner. ED may be a sign of health problems such as diabetes or heart disease. So if you have an erection problem, do not wait to seek help.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Call your provider if:  - The problem does not go away with lifestyle changes  - The problem begins after an injury or prostate surgery  - You have other symptoms, such as low back pain, abdominal pain, or a change in urination    If you think any medicine you are taking may be causing erection problems, talk with your provider. You may need to lower the dose or change to another drug. DO NOT change or stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.  Talk to your provider if your erection problems have to do with a fear of heart problems. Sexual intercourse is usually safe for men with heart problems.  Call your provider right away or go to an emergency room if you are taking ED medicine and it gives you an erection that lasts for more than 4 hours.

Prevention : To help prevent erection problems:  - Quit smoking  - Cut back on alcohol (no more than 2 drinks per day)  - DO NOT use illegal drugs  - Get plenty of sleep and take time to relax  - Stay at a healthy weight for your height  - Exercise and eat a healthy diet to keep good blood circulation  - If you have diabetes, keep blood sugar well-controlled  - Talk openly with your partner about your relationship and sex life. Seek counseling if you and your partner have trouble communicating.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/erectiledysfunction.html
Answer: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common type of male sexual dysfunction. It is when a man has trouble getting or keeping an erection. ED becomes more common as you get older. But it's not a natural part of aging.    Some people have trouble speaking with their doctors about sex. But if you have ED, you should tell your doctor. ED can be a sign of health problems. It may mean your blood vessels are clogged. It may mean you have nerve damage from diabetes. If you don't see your doctor, these problems will go untreated.     Your doctor can offer several new treatments for ED. For many men, the answer is as simple as taking a pill. Getting more exercise, losing weight, or stopping smoking may also help.

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001096.htm
Answer: Pulmonary valve stenosis is a heart valve disorder that involves the pulmonary valve.  This is the valve separating the right ventricle (one of the chambers in the heart) and the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery carries oxygen-poor blood to the lungs.  Stenosis, or narrowing, occurs when the valve cannot open wide enough. As a result, less blood flows to the lungs.)

Answer: Narrowing of the pulmonary valve is most often present at birth (congenital). It is caused by a problem that occurs as the baby develops in the womb before birth. The cause is unknown, but genes may play a role.  Narrowing that occurs in the valve itself is called pulmonary valve stenosis. There may also be narrowing just before or after the valve.   The defect may occur alone or with other heart defects that are present at birth. The condition can be mild or severe.  Pulmonary valve stenosis is a rare disorder. In some cases, the problem runs in families.)

GHR_0000962_Sec3.txt,"Question: What are the genetic changes related to supravalvular aortic stenosis ? (Also called: aortic stenosis, supravalvular; stenosis, aortic supravalvular; stenosis, supravalvular aortic; supravalvular stenosis, aortic; SVAS)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/supravalvular-aortic-stenosis
Answer: Mutations in the ELN gene cause SVAS. The ELN gene provides instructions for making a protein called tropoelastin. Multiple copies of the tropoelastin protein attach to one another and are processed to form a mature protein called elastin. Elastin is the major component of elastic fibers, which are slender bundles of proteins that provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs). Elastic fibers are found in the intricate lattice that forms in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix), where they give structural support to organs and tissues such as the heart, skin, lungs, ligaments, and blood vessels. Elastic fibers make up approximately 50 percent of the aorta, the rest being primarily muscle cells called vascular smooth muscle cells that line the aorta. Together, elastic fibers and vascular smooth muscle cells provide flexibility and resilience to the aorta.  Most of the ELN gene mutations that cause SVAS lead to a decrease in the production of tropoelastin. A shortage of tropoelastin reduces the amount of mature elastin protein that is processed and available for forming elastic fibers. As a result, elastic fibers that make up the aorta are thinner than normal. To compensate, the smooth muscle cells that line the aorta increase in number, making the aorta thicker and narrower than usual. A thickened aorta is less flexible and resilient to the stress of constant blood flow and pumping of the heart. Over time, the wall of the aorta can become damaged. Aortic narrowing causes the heart to work harder to pump blood through the aorta, resulting in the signs and symptoms of SVAS.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/supravalvular-aortic-stenosis
Answer: Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a heart defect that develops before birth. This defect is a narrowing (stenosis) of the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). The condition is described as supravalvular because the section of the aorta that is narrowed is located just above the valve that connects the aorta with the heart (the aortic valve). Some people with SVAS also have defects in other blood vessels, most commonly stenosis of the artery from the heart to the lungs (the pulmonary artery). An abnormal heart sound during a heartbeat (heart murmur) can often be heard during a chest exam. If SVAS is not treated, the aortic narrowing can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and ultimately heart failure.  The severity of SVAS varies considerably, even among family members. Some affected individuals die in infancy, while others never experience symptoms of the disorder.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/supravalvular-aortic-stenosis
Answer: This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. However, some people who inherit the altered gene never develop features of SVAS. (This situation is known as reduced penetrance.)  In some cases, a person inherits the mutation from one parent who has the mutation. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.)

ADAM_0000288_Sec2.txt,"Question: What causes Aortic stenosis ? (Also called: Aortic valve stenosis; Rheumatic aortic stenosis; Calcific aortic stenosis)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000178.htm
Answer: As the aortic valve narrows, the left ventricle has to work harder to pump blood out through the valve. To do this extra work, the muscles in the ventricle walls become thicker. This can lead to chest pain.   As the pressure continues to rise, blood may back up into the lungs. Severe aortic stenosis can limit the amount of blood that reaches the brain and the rest of the body.  Aortic stenosis may be present from birth (congenital), but most often it develops later in life. Children with aortic stenosis may have other conditions present from birth.  Aortic stenosis mainly occurs due to the buildup of calcium deposits that narrow the valve. This is called calcific aortic stenosis. The problem mostly affects older people.   Calcification of the valve happens sooner in people who are born with abnormal aortic or bicuspid valves. In rare cases, calcification can develop more quickly when a person has received chest radiation (such as for cancer treatment).  Another cause is rheumatic fever. This condition can develop after strep throat or scarlet fever. Valve problems do not develop for 5 - 10 years or longer after rheumatic fever occurs. Rheumatic fever is becoming rarer in the United States.  Aortic stenosis occurs in about 2% of people over 65 years of age. It occurs more often in men than in women.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000178.htm
Answer: Most people with aortic stenosis do not develop symptoms until the disease is advanced. The diagnosis may have been made when the health care provider heard a heart murmur and performed tests.  Symptoms of aortic stenosis include:  - Chest discomfort: The chest pain may get worse with activity and reach into the arm, neck, or jaw. The chest may also feel tight or squeezed.  - Cough, possibly bloody  - Breathing problems when exercising  - Becoming easily tired  - Feeling the heart beat (palpitations)  - Fainting, weakness, or dizziness with activity   In infants and children, symptoms include:  - Becoming easily tired with exertion (in mild cases)  - Failure to gain weight  - Poor feeding  - Serious breathing problems that develop within days or weeks of birth (in severe cases)   Children with mild or moderate aortic stenosis may get worse as they get older. They are also at risk for a heart infection called bacterial endocarditis.)

Answer: A heart murmur, click, or other abnormal sound is almost always heard through a stethoscope. The health care provider may be able to feel a vibration or movement when placing a hand over the heart. There may be a faint pulse or changes in the quality of the pulse in the neck.  Blood pressure may be low.  Aortic stenosis is most often detected and then followed using a test called an echocardiogram.  The following tests may also be performed:  - ECG  - Exercise stress testing  - Left cardiac catheterization  - MRI of the heart  - Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE))

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000178.htm
Answer: Regular checkups by a health provider may be all that is needed if your symptoms are not severe. The health care provider should ask about your health history, do a physical exam, and perform an echocardiogram.  People with severe aortic stenosis may be told not to play competitive sports, even if they have no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, strenuous activity must often be limited.  Medicines are used to treat symptoms of heart failure or abnormal heart rhythms (most commonly atrial fibrillation). These include diuretics (water pills), nitrates, and beta-blockers. High blood pressure should also be treated. If aortic stenosis is severe, this treatment must be done carefully so blood pressure does not drop too far.  In the past, most people with heart valve problems were given antibiotics before dental work or a procedure such as colonoscopy. The antibiotics were given to prevent an infection of the damaged heart. However, antibiotics are now used much less often before dental work and other procedures. Check with your health care provider to find out whether you need antibiotics.  People with this and other heart conditions should stop smoking and be tested for high cholesterol.  Surgery to repair or replace the valve is often done for adults or children who develop symptoms. Even if symptoms are not very bad, the doctor may recommend surgery based on test results.  A less invasive procedure called balloon valvuloplasty may be done instead of surgery.  - A balloon is placed into an artery in the groin, threaded to the heart, placed across the valve, and inflated. However, narrowing often occurs again after this procedure.  - A newer procedure done at the same time as valvuloplasty can implant an artificial valve. This procedure is most often done in patients who cannot have surgery, but itis becoming more common.    Some children may need aortic valve repair or replacement. Children with mild aortic stenosis may be able to take part in most activities.)

Sometimes, the pupil of the eye may appear white, or the normal red reflex may appear to be white. This not a normal condition, and you need to see an eye care provider right away.  There are many different causes of white pupil or white reflex. Other conditions also can mimic white pupil. If the cornea, which is normally clear, becomes cloudy, it may look similar to a white pupil. Although the causes of a cloudy or white cornea are different from those of a white pupil or white reflex, these problems also need medical attention right away.  Cataracts may also cause the pupil to appear white.)

Answer: Most causes of white pupil will cause decreased vision. This may often occur before the pupil appears to be white.   Detecting a white pupil is especially important in infants. Babies are unable to communicate to others that their vision is decreased. It is also harder to measure an infant's vision during an eye exam.  If you see a white pupil, make an appointment with your health care provider right away. Well-child exams routinely screen for a white pupil in children. A child that develops a white pupil or cloudy cornea needs immediate attention, preferably from an eye specialist.)

ADAM_0003341_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about RBC count (Also called: Erythrocyte count; Red blood cell count)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003644.htm
Answer: Summary : An RBC count is a blood test that measures how many red blood cells (RBCs) you have.  RBCs contain hemoglobin, which carries oxygen. How much oxygen your body tissues get depends on how many RBCs you have and how well they work.      Watch this video about:   Red blood cell production

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.

How to Prepare for the Test : No special preparation is necessary for adults.

How the Test will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.

Why the Test is Performed : The RBC count is almost always part of the CBC (complete blood count) test.  The test can help diagnose different kinds of anemia (low number of RBCs) and other conditions affecting red blood cells.  Additional conditions under which an RBC count may be performed:  - Disease that damages kidney blood vessels (Alport syndrome)  - White blood cell cancer (macroglobulinemia of Waldenstrom)  - Disorder in which red blood cells break down earlier than normal (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)  - Bone marrow disorder in which the marrow is replaced by scar tissue (myelofibrosis)

Normal Results : Normal RBC range is:  - Male: 4.7 to 6.1 million cells per microliter (cells/mcL)  - Female: 4.2 to 5.4 million cells/mcL   The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Higher-than-normal numbers of RBCs may be due to:  - Cigarette smoking  - Problem with heart's structure and function that is present at birth (congenital heart disease)  - Failure of the right side of the heart (cor pulmonale)  - Dehydration (such as from severe diarrhea)  - Kidney tumor (renal cell carcinoma)  - Low blood oxygen level (hypoxia)  - Scarring or thickening of the lungs (pulmonary fibrosis)  - Bone marrow disease that causes abnormal increase in RBCs (polycythemia vera)    Your RBC count will increase for several weeks when you move to a higher altitude.  Drugs that can increase the RBC count include:  - Gentamicin  - Methyldopa    Lower-than-normal numbers of RBCs may be due to:  - Anemia  - Bleeding  - Bone marrow failure (for example, from radiation, toxins, or tumor)  - Deficiency of a hormone called erythropoietin (caused by kidney disease)  - RBC destruction (hemolysis) due to transfusion, blood vessel injury, or other cause  - Leukemia  - Malnutrition  - Bone marrow cancer called multiple myeloma  - Nutrition deficiencies of iron, copper, folic acid, vitamin B6, or vitamin B12  - Overhydration  - Pregnancy    Drugs that can decrease the RBC count include:  - Chemotherapy drugs  - Chloramphenicol  - Hydantoins  - Quinidine

Risks : There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.  Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling light-headed  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken))

ADAM_0004312_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about White matter of the brain
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002344.htm
Answer: Summary : White matter is found in the deeper tissues of the brain (subcortical). It contains nerve fibers (axons), which are extensions of nerve cells (neurons). Many of these nerve fibers are surrounded by a type of sheath or covering called myelin. Myelin gives the white matter its color. It also protects the nerve fibers from injury and improves the speed and transmission of electrical nerve signals.   By comparison, gray matter is tissue found on the surface of the brain (cortical). It contains the cell bodies of neurons, which give gray matter its color.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000151.htm
Answer: Normally, electrical signals follow a certain pathway through the heart. This helps the heart beat regularly. This prevents the heart from having extra beats or beats happening too soon.   In people with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, some of the heart's electrical signal goes down an extra pathway. This may cause a very rapid heart rate called supraventricular tachycardia.  Most people with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome do not have any other heart problems. However, this condition has been linked with other cardiac conditions, such as Ebstein anomaly. A form of the condition also runs in families.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/white-sponge-nevus
Answer: White sponge nevus is a condition characterized by the formation of white patches of tissue called nevi (singular: nevus) that appear as thickened, velvety, sponge-like tissue. The nevi are most commonly found on the moist lining of the mouth (oral mucosa), especially on the inside of the cheeks (buccal mucosa). Affected individuals usually develop multiple nevi. Rarely, white sponge nevi also occur on the mucosae (singular: mucosa) of the nose, esophagus, genitals, or anus. The nevi are caused by a noncancerous (benign) overgrowth of cells.  White sponge nevus can be present from birth but usually first appears during early childhood. The size and location of the nevi can change over time. In the oral mucosa, both sides of the mouth are usually affected. The nevi are generally painless, but the folds of extra tissue can promote bacterial growth, which can lead to infection that may cause discomfort. The altered texture and appearance of the affected tissue, especially the oral mucosa, can be bothersome for some affected individuals.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/white-sponge-nevus
Answer: Mutations in the KRT4 or KRT13 gene cause white sponge nevus. These genes provide instructions for making proteins called keratins. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of epithelial cells, which are cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body and make up the different mucosae. The keratin 4 protein (produced from the KRT4 gene) and the keratin 13 protein (produced from the KRT13 gene) partner together to form molecules known as intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into networks that provide strength and resilience to the different mucosae. Networks of intermediate filaments protect the mucosae from being damaged by friction or other everyday physical stresses.  Mutations in the KRT4 or KRT13 gene disrupt the structure of the keratin protein. As a result, keratin 4 and keratin 13 are mismatched and do not fit together properly, leading to the formation of irregular intermediate filaments that are easily damaged with little friction or trauma. Fragile intermediate filaments in the oral mucosa might be damaged when eating or brushing one's teeth. Damage to intermediate filaments leads to inflammation and promotes the abnormal growth and division (proliferation) of epithelial cells, causing the mucosae to thicken and resulting in white sponge nevus.)

GHR_0001035_Sec4.txt,"Question: Is white sponge nevus inherited ? (Also called: Cannon's disease; familial white folded mucosal dysplasia; hereditary leukokeratosis; hereditary mucosal leukokeratosis; hereditary oral keratosis; leukokeratosis of oral mucosa; leukokeratosis, hereditary mucosal; nevus of Cannon; white folded gingivostomatosis; white gingivostomatitis; white sponge naevus; white sponge nevus of Cannon; white sponge nevus of mucosa; WSN)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/white-sponge-nevus
Answer: This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell can be sufficient to cause the disorder. However, some people who have a mutation that causes white sponge nevus do not develop these abnormal growths; this phenomenon is called reduced penetrance.)

ADAM_0001052_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about CSF cell count
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003625.htm
Answer: Summary : A CSF cell count is a test to measure the number of red and white blood cells that are in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear fluid that in the space around the spinal cord and brain.

How the Test is Performed : A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is the most common way to collect this sample. Rarely, other methods are used for collecting CSF such as:  - Cisternal puncture  - Ventricular puncture  - Removal of CSF from a tube that is already in the CSF, such as a shunt or ventricular drain.   After the sample is taken, it is sent to a lab for evaluation.

Why the Test is Performed : The CSF cell count may help detect:  - Meningitis and infection of the brain or spinal cord  - Tumor, abscess, or area of tissue death (infarct)  - Inflammation  - Bleeding into the spinal fluid

Normal Results : The normal white blood cell count is between 0 and 5. The normal red blood cell count is 0.  Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.  The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.

What Abnormal Results Mean : An increase of white blood cells indicates infection, inflammation, or bleeding into the cerebrospinal fluid. Some causes include:  - Abscess  - Encephalitis  - Hemorrhage  - Meningitis  - Multiple sclerosis  - Other infections  - Stroke  - Tumor    Finding red blood cells in the CSF may be a sign of bleeding. However, red blood cells in the CSF may also be due to the spinal tap needle hitting a blood vessel.  Additional conditions which this test may help diagnose include:  - Arteriovenous malformation (cerebral)  - Cerebral aneurysm  - Delirium  - Guillain-Barre syndrome  - Stroke  - Neurosyphilis  - Primary lymphoma of the brain  - Seizure disorders, including epilepsy  - Spinal tumor)

ADAM_0002443_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) Low white blood cell count and cancer ? (Also called: Neutropenia and cancer; Absolute neutrophil count and cancer; ANC and cancer)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000675.htm
Answer: White blood cells fight infections from bacteria, viruses, fungi. and other pathogens (organisms that cause infection). One important type of white blood cell is the neutrophil. These cells are made in bone marrow and travel in the blood throughout the body. They sense infections, gather at sites of infection, and destroy the pathogens.   When the body has too few neutrophils, the condition is called neutropenia. This makes it harder for the body to fight off pathogens. As a result the person is more likely to get sick from infections. In general, an adult who has fewer than 1,000 neutrophils in a microliter of blood has neutropenia.  If the neutrophil count is very low, (fewer than 500 neutrophils in a microliter of blood), it is called severe neutropenia. When the neutrophil count gets this low, even the bacteria normally living in a person's mouth, skin, and gut can cause serious infections.)

Answer: Summary : A WBC count is a blood test to measure the number of white blood cells (WBCs) in the blood.  WBCs help fight infections. They are also called leukocytes. There are five major types of white blood cells:  - Basophils  - Eosinophils  - Lymphocytes (T cells, B cells, and Natural Killer cells)  - Monocytes  - Neutrophils

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.

How to Prepare for the Test : Most of the time, you do not need to take special steps before this test. Tell your health care provider the medicines you are taking, includingthe oneswithout a prescription. Some drugs may change the test results.

How the Test will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.

Why the Test is Performed : You will have this test to find out how many WBCs you have. Your body produces more WBCs for several reasons. The most common reasons are when you have an infection or allergic reaction. You can also have more WBCs when you are under stress or have inflammation. Some people naturally have a ""normal"" high or low number of WBCs. An increased number of WBCs can be due to a blood cancer, such as leukemia or lymphoma.

Normal Results : The normal number of WBCs in the blood is 4,500 to 11,000 white blood cells per microliter (mcL).  Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to yourdoctor about your test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : LOW WHITE BLOOD CELL (WBC) COUNT  A low number of WBCs is called leukopenia. A WBC count below 4500 is below normal  One type of white blood cell is the neutrophil. This type of white blood cell is important for fighting infections.  - An adult with fewer than 1700 neutrophils in a microliter of blood has a low white blood cell count.  - If there are fewer than 500 neutrophils in a microliter of blood, the risk for infection becomes even higher.   It may be due to:  - Bone marrow deficiency or failure (for example, due to infection, tumor, or abnormal scarring)  - Cancer treating drugs, or other medicines (see list below)  - Certain autoimmune disorders such as lupus  - Disease of the liver or spleen  - Radiation treatment for cancer  - Certain viral illnesses, such as mononucleosis (mono)  - Cancers that damage the bone marrow  - Very severe bacterial infections   HIGH WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT  A high number of WBCs is called leukocytosis. It may be due to:  - Aplastic anemia  - Certain drugs or medicines (see list below)  - Cigarette smoking  - Not having a spleen, due to spleen removal  - Infections, most often those caused by bacteria  - Inflammatory disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis or allergy)  - Leukemia  - Severe mental or physical stress  - Tissue damage (for example, burns)   There may also be less common reasons for this result.  Drugs that may lower your WBC count include:  - Antibiotics  - Anticonvulsants  - Anti-thyroid drugs  - Arsenicals  - Captopril  - Chemotherapy drugs  - Chlorpromazine  - Clozapine  - Diuretics  - Histamine-2 blockers  - Sulfonamides  - Quinidine  - Terbinafine  - Ticlopidine   Drugs that may increase WBC counts include:  - Beta adrenergic agonists (for example, albuterol)  - Corticosteroids  - Epinephrine  - Granulocyte colony stimulating factor  - Heparin  - Lithium

Risks : Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.  Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling lightheaded  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken))

ADAM_0000052_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Acid mucopolysaccharides (Also called: AMP; Dermatan sulfate - urine; Urine heparan sulfate; Urine dermatan sulfate; Heparan sulfate - urine)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003368.htm
Answer: Summary : Acid mucopolysaccharides is a test that measures the amount of mucopolysaccharides released into the urine either on 1 episode or over a 24-hour period.  Mucopolysaccharides are long chains of sugar molecules in the body. They are often found in mucus and in fluid around the joints.

How the Test is Performed : For the 24-hour test, you must urinate into a special bag or container every time you use the bathroom.  - On day 1, urinate over the toilet into the container or bag when you wake up in the morning. Close the container tightly. Keep it in the refrigerator or a cool place during the collection period.  - Urinate into the special container every time you use the bathroom for the next 24 hours.  - On day 2, urinate into the container in the morning again when you wake up.  - Label the container with your name, the date, the time of completion, and return it as instructed.    For an infant:  Thoroughly wash the area around the urethra (the hole where urine flows out). Open a urine collection bag (a plastic bag with an adhesive paper on one end).  - For males, place the entire penis in the bag and attach the adhesive paper to the skin.  - For females, place the bag over the two folds of skin on either side of the vagina (labia). Put a diaper on the baby (over the bag).    Check the infant often, and change the bag after the infant has urinated. Empty the urine from the bag into the container provided by your doctor.  Active babies can move the bag causing the urine to go into the diaper. You may need extra collection bags.  When finished, label the container and return it as you have been told.

How to Prepare for the Test : There is no special preparation needed.

How the Test will Feel : The test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort.

Why the Test is Performed : This test is done to diagnose a rare group of genetic disorders called mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). These include, Hurler, Scheie, and Hurler/Scheie syndromes (MPS I), Hunter syndrome (MPS II), Sanfilippo syndrome (MPS III), Morquio syndrome (MPS IV), Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (MPS VI), and Sly syndrome (MPS VII).  Most of the time, this test is done in infants who may have a symptom or family history of one of these disorders.

Normal Results : Normal levels vary with age and from lab to lab. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormally high levels could be consistent with a type of mucopolysaccharidosis. Further tests are needed to determine the specific type of mucopolysaccharidosis.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001956.htm
Answer: Summary : Your health care provider may give you a prescription in different ways, including:   - Writing a paper prescription that you take to a local pharmacy  - Calling or e-mailing a pharmacy to order the medicine  - Sending your prescription to the pharmacy by way of a computer that is linked to the provider's electronic medical record (EMR)    You also need to find out if your health plan will pay for the medicine your provider prescribed.   - Certain types or brands of medicine may not be covered.  - Many health plans require you to pay the pharmacy a portion of the cost of the prescription price. This called a co-pay.    Once you get a prescription from your provider, you may buy the medicine in different ways.   LOCAL PHARMACIES   The most common place for filling a prescription is at a local pharmacy. Some pharmacies are located inside of a grocery or large ""chain"" store.   It is best to fill all prescriptions with the same pharmacy. That way, the pharmacy has a record of all the medicines you are taking. This helps prevent drug interactions.   Your health plan may require you to use certain pharmacies. This means they may not pay for your prescription if you do not use one of these pharmacies. To find a pharmacy that takes your health plan:  - Call the phone number on the back of your insurance card.  - Call the pharmacy you want to use to see if they have a contract with your insurance plan.    To help the pharmacist fill the prescription:   - Make sure all of the information is filled in clearly.  - Bring your insurance card the first time you fill the prescription.  - When calling the pharmacy for a refill, make sure to give your name, the prescription number, and the name of the medicine.    MAIL-ORDER PHARMACIES   Some people and insurance companies choose to use mail-order pharmacies.   - The prescription is sent to the mail-order pharmacy or phoned in by the provider.  - Your medicine may cost less when you order it by mail. However, it may take a week or more for the medicine to get to you.  - Mail order is best used for long-term medicines you use for chronic problems.  - Buy short-term medicines and drugs that need to be stored at certain temperatures at a local pharmacy.    INTERNET (ONLINE) PHARMACIES   Internet pharmacies can be used for long-term medicines and medical supplies.   - The website should have clear directions for filling or transferring your prescription.  - Make sure that the website has clearly-stated privacy policies and other procedures.  - AVOID any website that claims a doctor can prescribe the medicine without seeing you.)

ADAM_0001817_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Hazardous materials (Also called: HazCom; Hazard communication; Material Safety Data Sheet; MSDS)
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000457.htm
Answer: Summary : Hazardous materials are substances that could harm human health or the environment. Hazardous means dangerous, so these materials must be handled the right way.  Hazard communication, or HAZCOM is teaching people how to work with hazardous materials and waste.  There are many different kinds of hazardous materials, including:  - Chemicals, like some that are used for cleaning  - Drugs, like chemotherapy to treat cancer  - Radioactive material that is used for x-rays or radiation treatments  - Human or animal tissue, blood, or other substances from the body that may carry harmful germs  - Gases that are used to make people sleep during surgery   Hazardous materials can harm you if they:  - Touch your skin  - Splash into your eyes  - Get into your airways or lungs when you breathe  - Cause fires or explosions   Your hospital or workplace has policies about how to deal with these materials. You will receive special training if you work with these materials.

Watch out for Hazardous Materials : Know where hazardous materials are used and stored. Some common areas are where:  - X-rays and other imaging tests are done  - Radiation treatments are performed  - Medicines are handled, prepared, or given to people -- especially cancer treatment drugs  - Chemicals or supplies are delivered, packed for shipping, or thrown away   Always treat any container that does not have a label like it is hazardous. Treat any spilled substance the same way.  If you do not know if something you use or find is harmful, be sure to ask.

Labels and Signs : Look for signs before you enter a person's room, a lab or x-ray area, a storage closet, or any area you do not know well.  You may see warning labels on boxes, containers, bottles, or tanks. Look for words like:  - Acid  - Alkali  - Carcinogenic  - Caution  - Corrosive  - Danger  - Explosive  - Flammable  - Irritant  - Radioactive  - Unstable  - Warning   A label called the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) will tell you if a material is hazardous. This label tells you:  - Names of the hazardous chemicals or substances in the container  - Facts about the substance, such as the odor or when it will boil or melt  - How it could harm you  - What your symptoms could be if you are exposed to the material  - How to safely handle the material and what protective equipment to wear when you handle it  - What steps to take before more skilled or trained professionals come to help  - If the material could cause a fire or explosion, and what to do if this happens  - What to do if a spill or leak occurs  - What to do if there is danger from the material mixing with other substances  - How to safely store the material, including what temperature to keep it at, if moisture is safe, and whether it should be in a room with good airflow

Work Safely : If you find a spill, treat it like it is hazardous until you know what it is. This means:  - Put on personal protective equipment (PPE), such as a respirator or mask and gloves that will protect you from chemicals.  - Use disinfectant wipes to clean up the spill and put the wipes in double plastic bags.  - Contact waste management to clean the area and to throw away the supplies you used to clean up the spill.    Always treat any unlabeled container as if it contains hazardous materials. This means:  - Put the container in a bag and take it to waste management to be thrown away.  - DO NOT pour the material down the drain.  - DO NOT put the material in the normal trash.  - DO NOT let it get into the air.    If you work with hazardous materials:  - Read the MSDS for all materials you use.  - Know what type of PPE to wear.  - Learn about exposure risks, such as whether the material can cause cancer.  - Know how to use the material and how to store it or throw it away when you are done.    Other tips include:  - Never enter an area where radiation therapy is taking place.  - Always use the safest container to move materials from one area to another.  - Check bottles, containers, or tanks for leaks.)

If necessary, begin rescue breathing or CPR. If the victim is breathing fewer than 6 breaths per minute, begin rescue breathing.  - Take the person inside to room temperature and cover with warm blankets. If going indoors is not possible, get the person out of the wind and use a blanket to provide insulation from the cold ground. Cover the person's head and neck to help retain body heat.  - Once inside, remove any wet ortight clothes and replace them with dry clothing.  - Warm the person. If necessary, use your own body heat to aid the warming. Apply warm compresses to the neck, chest wall, and groin. If the person is alert and can easily swallow, give warm, sweetened, nonalcoholic fluids to aid the warming.  - Stay with the person until medical help arrives.)

ADAM_0003870_Sec1.txt,"Question: Do you have information about Temperature measurement
URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003400.htm
Answer: Summary : The measurement of body temperature can help detect illness. It can also monitor whether or not treatment is working. A high temperature is a fever.

How the Test is Performed : The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends against using glass thermometers with mercury. The glass can break, and mercury is a poison.  Electronic thermometers are most often recommended. The temperature is displayed on an easy-to-read panel. The probe can be placed in the mouth, rectum, or armpit.  - Mouth -- place the probe under the tongue and close the mouth. Breathe through the nose, and use the lips to hold the thermometer tightly in place. Leave the thermometer in the mouth for 3 minutes or until the device beeps.  - Rectum -- this method is for infants and small children who are not able to hold a thermometer safely in their mouth. Place petroleum jelly on the bulb of a rectal thermometer. Place the small child face down on a flat surface or lap. Spread the buttocks and insert the bulb end about 1/2 to 1 inch into the anal canal. Be careful not to insert it too far. Struggling can push the thermometer in further. Remove after 3 minutes or when the device beeps.  - Armpit -- place the thermometer in the armpit, with the arm pressed against the body. Wait for 5 minutes before reading.    Plastic strip thermometers change color to show the temperature. This method is the least accurate.   - Place the strip on the forehead and read it after 1 minute while the strip is in place.  - Plastic strip thermometers for the mouth are also available.    Always clean the thermometer before and after using. You can use cool, soapy water or rubbing alcohol.   Electronic ear thermometers are common and easy to use. However, some users report that the results are less accurate than with probe thermometers.

How to Prepare for the Test : Wait at least 1 hour after heavy exercise or a hot bath before measuring body temperature. Wait for 20 to 30 minutes after smoking, eating, or drinking a hot or cold liquid.

Normal Results : The average normal body temperature is 98.6F (37C). The normal temperature can vary due to:  - Age (in children over 6 months, daily temperature can vary by 1 to 2 degrees)  - Person  - Time of day (often highest in the evening)  - Where on the body the temperature was taken    Body temperature can be raised by:  - Being active  - Being in a high temperature or high humidity  - Eating  - Feeling strong emotions  - Menstruating (in women)  - Taking certain medicines  - Teething (in a young child -- but no higher than 100F)  - Wearing heavy clothing

What Abnormal Results Mean : If the reading on the thermometer is more than 1 to 1.5 degrees above your normal temperature, you have a fever. Fevers may be a sign of:  - Blood clots  - Cancer  - Certain types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus  - Diseases in the intestines, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis  - Infection (both serious and non-serious)  - Many other medical problems    Body temperature that is too high or too low can be serious. Call your health care provider if this is the case.  Often, older people do not run a high temperature, even if they are sick.  Related topics include:  - How to treat a fever, especially in infants  - When to call a health care provider for a fever)

GHR_0000019_Sec1.txt,"Question: What is (are) adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency ? (Also called: AMP deaminase deficiency; exercise-induced myopathy; MAD deficiency; MADA deficiency; muscle AMP deaminase deficiency; myoadenylate deaminase deficiency)
URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/adenosine-monophosphate-deaminase-deficiency
Answer: Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase deficiency is a condition that can affect the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). People with this condition do not make enough of an enzyme called AMP deaminase. In most people, AMP deaminase deficiency does not cause any symptoms. People who do experience symptoms typically have muscle pain (myalgia) or weakness after exercise or prolonged physical activity. They often get tired more quickly and stay tired longer than would normally be expected. Some affected individuals have more severe symptoms, but it is unclear whether these symptoms are due solely to a lack of AMP deaminase or additional factors. Muscle weakness is typically apparent beginning in childhood or early adulthood.  Researchers have proposed three types of AMP deaminase deficiency, which are distinguished by their symptoms and genetic cause.)

Answer: AMP deaminase deficiency is one of the most common inherited muscle disorders in white populations, affecting 1 in 50 to 100 people. The prevalence is lower in African Americans, affecting an estimated 1 in 40,000 people, and the condition is even less common in the Japanese population.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/adenosine-monophosphate-deaminase-deficiency
Answer: Mutations in the AMPD1 gene cause AMP deaminase deficiency. The AMPD1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called AMP deaminase. This enzyme is found in skeletal muscle, where it plays a role in producing energy within muscle cells. Mutations in the AMPD1 gene disrupt the function of AMP deaminase and impair the muscle cells' ability to produce energy. This lack of energy can lead to myalgia or other muscle problems associated with AMP deaminase deficiency.  The three types of AMP deaminase deficiency are known as the inherited type, acquired type, and coincidental inherited type.  Individuals with the inherited type have a mutation in both copies of the AMPD1 gene in each cell. Most people are asymptomatic, meaning they have no symptoms. Some people with AMP deaminase deficiency experience muscle weakness or pain following exercise.  The acquired type occurs in people who have decreased levels of AMP deaminase due to the presence of a muscle or joint condition.  People with the coincidental inherited type have a mutation in both copies of the AMPD1 gene. Additionally, they have a separate joint or muscle disorder. Some individuals experience more severe joint or muscle symptoms related to their disorder if they have AMP deaminase deficiency than do people without this enzyme deficiency. Most, however, do not have any symptoms associated with AMP deaminase deficiency.  It is not known why most people with this condition do not experience symptoms. Researchers speculate that additional mutations in other genes may be involved.)

URL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/adenosine-monophosphate-deaminase-deficiency
Answer: This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a696016.html
Answer: Glimepiride is used along with diet and exercise, and sometimes with other medications, to treat type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Glimepiride lowers blood sugar by causing the pancreas to produce insulin (a natural substance that is needed to break down sugar in the body) and helping the body use insulin efficiently. This medication will only help lower blood sugar in people whose bodies produce insulin naturally. Glimepiride is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may occur if high blood sugar is not treated).  Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.)

URL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a696016.html
Answer: Glimepiride comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with breakfast or the first main meal of the day. To help you remember to take glimepiride, take it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take glimepiride exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of glimepiride and gradually increase your dose if needed. After you have taken glimepiride for some time, glimepiride may not control your blood sugar as well as it did at the beginning of your treatment. Your doctor may adjust the dose of your medication as needed so that the medication will work best for you. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling and if your blood sugar test results have been higher or lower than normal at any time during your treatment.  Glimepiride helps control blood sugar but does not cure diabetes. Continue to take glimepiride even if you feel well. Do not stop taking glimepiride without talking to your doctor.)

Answer: Before you start to take glimepiride, ask you doctor what you should do if you forget to take a dose. Write these directions down so that you can refer to them later.  As a general rule, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule.
