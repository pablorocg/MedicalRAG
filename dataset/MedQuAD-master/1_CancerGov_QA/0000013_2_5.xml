			<Answer>Key Points
                    - Chronic eosinophilic leukemia is a disease in which too many white blood cells (eosinophils) are made in the bone marrow.    - Signs and symptoms of chronic eosinophilic leukemia include fever and feeling very tired.
                
                
                    Chronic eosinophilic leukemia is a disease in which too many white blood cells (eosinophils) are made in the bone marrow.
                    Eosinophils are white blood cells that react to allergens (substances that cause an allergic response) and help fight infections caused by certain parasites. In chronic eosinophilic leukemia, there are too many eosinophils in the blood, bone marrow, and other tissues. Chronic eosinophilic leukemia may stay the same for many years or it may progress quickly to acute leukemia.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000013_2-3" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment of chronic eosinophilic leukemia may include the following:            -  Bone marrow transplant.     -  Biologic therapy using interferon alfa.     - A clinical trial of a new treatment.            Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with chronic eosinophilic leukemia. For more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you. General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.</Answer>
