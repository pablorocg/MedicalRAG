                    Primary myelofibrosis is a disease in which abnormal blood cells and fibers build up inside the bone marrow.
                    The bone marrow is made of tissues that make blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) and a web of fibers that support the blood-forming tissues. In primary myelofibrosis (also called chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), large numbers of blood stem cells become blood cells that do not mature properly (blasts). The web of fibers inside the bone marrow also becomes very thick (like scar tissue) and slows the blood-forming tissues ability to make blood cells. This causes the blood-forming tissues to make fewer and fewer blood cells. In order to make up for the low number of blood cells made in the bone marrow, the liver and spleen begin to make the blood cells.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000013_2-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Primary Myelofibrosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Symptoms of primary myelofibrosis include pain below the ribs on the left side and feeling very tired. Primary myelofibrosis often does not cause early signs or symptoms. It may be found during a routine blood test. Signs and symptoms may be caused by primary myelofibrosis or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         - Feeling pain or fullness below the ribs on the left side.    - Feeling full sooner than normal when eating.    - Feeling very tired.    - Shortness of breath.    - Easy bruising or bleeding.    -  Petechiae (flat, red, pinpoint spots under the skin that are caused by bleeding).    -  Fever.    - Night sweats.    - Weight loss.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000013_2-3" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Primary Myelofibrosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for primary myelofibrosis. Prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - The age of the patient.    - The number of abnormal red blood cells and white blood cells.    - The number of blasts in the blood.    - Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes.    - Whether the patient has signs such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000013_2-4" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Primary Myelofibrosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment of primary myelofibrosis in patients without signs or symptoms is usually watchful waiting.    Patients with primary myelofibrosis may have signs or symptoms of anemia. Anemia is usually treated with transfusion of red blood cells to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. In addition, anemia may be treated with:             -  Erythropoietic growth factors.     -  Prednisone.     -  Danazol.     -  Thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide, with or without prednisone.            Treatment of primary myelofibrosis in patients with other signs or symptoms may include the following:            -  Targeted therapy with ruxolitinib.     -  Chemotherapy.     -  Donor stem cell transplant.     - Thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide.     -  Splenectomy.     -  Radiation therapy to the spleen, lymph nodes, or other areas outside the bone marrow where blood cells are forming.     -  Biologic therapy using interferon alfa or erythropoietic growth factors.     - A clinical trial of other targeted therapy drugs.            Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with primary myelofibrosis. For more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you. General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.</Answer>
