			<Question qid="0000404-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Bathing a patient in bed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Some patients cannot safely leave their beds to bathe. For these people, daily bed baths can help keep their skin healthy, control odor, and increase comfort. If moving the patient causes pain, plan to give them a bed bath after they have received pain medicine and it has taken effect. Encourage the patient to be as involved as possible in bathing themselves. A bed bath is a good time to inspect a patient's skin for redness and sores. Pay special attention to skin folds and bony areas when checking.</Answer>
