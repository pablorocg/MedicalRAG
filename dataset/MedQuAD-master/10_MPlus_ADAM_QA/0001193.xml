			<Question qid="0001193-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Diabetes eye exams ?</Question>
			<Answer>Diabetes can harm your eyes. It can damage the small blood vessels in your  retina , the back wall of your eyeball. This condition is called  diabetic retinopathy . Diabetes also increases your risk of  glaucoma  and other eye problems. You may not notice that your eyes are damaged until the problem is very bad. Your eye doctor can catch problems early if you get regular eye exams. This is very important. The early stages of diabetic retinopathy don't cause changes in vision and you won't have symptoms. Only an eye exam can detect the problem, so that steps can be taken to prevent the eye damage from getting worse.</Answer>
