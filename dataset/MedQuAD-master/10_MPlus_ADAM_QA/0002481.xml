			<Question qid="0002481-2" qtype="causes">What causes Lymphangitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The  lymph system  is a network of lymph nodes, lymph ducts, lymph vessels, and organs that produce and move a fluid called lymph from tissues to the bloodstream. Lymphangitis most often results from an  acute  streptococcal infection of the skin. Less often, it is caused by a staphylococcal infection. The infection causes the lymph vessels to become inflamed. Lymphangitis may be a sign that a skin or soft tissue infection is getting worse. The bacteria can spread further into the blood and cause life-threatening problems.</Answer>
