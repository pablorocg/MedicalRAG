			<Answer>Surgery can usually repair a TEF and EA. Once healing from the surgery is complete, your child may have these problems: The part of the esophagus that was repaired may become narrower. Your child may need to have more surgery to treat this., Your child may have heartburn, or gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). This occurs when acid from the stomach goes up into the esophagus. GERD may cause breathing problems. ,  During infancy and early childhood, many children will have problems with breathing, growth, and feeding, and will need to continue seeing both their primary care provider and specialists. Babies with TEF and EA who also have defects of other organs, most commonly the heart, may have long-term health problems.</Answer>
