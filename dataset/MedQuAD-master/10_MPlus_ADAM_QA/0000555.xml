			<Question qid="0000555-7" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Breast lump removal ?</Question>
			<Answer>The outcome of a lumpectomy for breast cancer depends mostly on the size of the cancer, as well as the make up of the tumor.&#160;It also depends on its spread to lymph nodes underneath your arm. A lumpectomy for breast cancer is most often followed by  radiation therapy  and other treatments such as  chemotherapy ,  hormonal therapy , or both. In most cases, you do not need a&#160; breast reconstruction  after lumpectomy.</Answer>
