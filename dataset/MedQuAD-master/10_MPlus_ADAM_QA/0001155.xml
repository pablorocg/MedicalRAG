			<Question qid="0001155-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Desipramine hydrochloride overdose</Question>
			<Answer>Desipramine hydrochloride is a type of medicine called a tricyclic antidepressant. It is most often taken to relieve symptoms of depression but has other common uses such as to treat long-term pain. Desipramine hydrochloride overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with has an  overdose , call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local  poison control center  can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
