			<Answer>Catecholamines are chemicals made by nerve tissue (including the brain) and the adrenal gland. The main types of catecholamines are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. These chemicals break down into other components, which leave your body through your urine. A urine test can be done to measure the amount of catecholamines produced by your body. Separate urine tests may be done to measure related substances.  Catecholamines can also be measured with a  blood test .</Answer>
