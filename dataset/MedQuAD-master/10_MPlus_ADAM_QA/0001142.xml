			<Question qid="0001142-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Dental x-rays</Question>
			<Answer>Dental x-rays are a type of image of the teeth and mouth. X-rays are a form of high energy electromagnetic radiation. The x-rays penetrate the body to form an image on film or screen. X-rays can be either digital or developed on a film. Structures that are dense (such as silver fillings or metal restoration) will block most of the light energy from the x-ray. This makes them appear white in the image. Structures that contain air will be black, and teeth, tissue, and fluid will appear as shades of gray.</Answer>
