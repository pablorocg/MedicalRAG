			<Question qid="0000507-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Bone marrow (stem cell) donation</Question>
			<Answer>Bone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside your bones. Bone marrow contains stem cells, which are immature cells that become blood cells.  People with life-threatening cancers, such as  leukemia ,  lymphoma , and  myeloma  can be treated with a  bone marrow transplant  or, sometimes, a stem cell transplant. For this type of treatment, bone marrow is collected from a donor. Sometimes, people can donate their own bone marrow for future use. Bone marrow donation can be done either by collecting a donor's bone marrow surgically, or by removing stem cells from a donor's blood.</Answer>
