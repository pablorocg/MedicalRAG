			<Question qid="0001969-1" qtype="information">What is (are) High blood pressure - what to ask your doctor ?</Question>
			<Answer>When your heart pumps blood into your arteries, the pressure of the blood against the artery walls is called your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is given as two numbers: systolic over diastolic blood pressure. Your systolic blood pressure is the highest blood pressure during the course of your heart beat cycle. Your diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure. When your  blood pressure gets too high , it puts extra stress on your heart and blood vessels. If your blood pressure stays high all the time, you will be at a higher risk for  heart attacks  and other vascular (blood vessel) diseases,  strokes ,  kidney disease , and other health problems. Below are questions you may want to ask your health care provider to help you take care of your blood pressure.</Answer>
