Types of lung problems or diseases that may be caused by medicines include: Allergic reactions  --  asthma ,  hypersensitivity pneumonitis , or  eosinophilic pneumonia , Bleeding into the lung air sacs, called alveoli (alveolar hemorrhage), Swelling and inflamed tissue in the main passages that carry air to the lungs ( bronchitis ), Damage to lung tissue ( interstitial fibrosis ), Drugs that cause the immune system to mistakenly attack and destroy healthy body tissue, such as  drug-induced lupus erythematosus , Granulomatous lung disease -- a type of inflammation in the lungs, Inflammation of the lung air sacs (pneumonitis or infiltration), Lung vasculitis (inflammation of lung blood vessels),  Lymph node swelling , Swelling and irritation (inflammation) of the chest area between the lungs ( mediastinitis ), Abnormal buildup of fluid in the lungs ( pulmonary edema ), Buildup of fluid between the layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity ( pleural effusion ), Abnormal pressure of the arteries that bring blood to the lungs (pulmonary hypertension),  Many medicines and substances are known to cause lung disease in some people. These include: Antibiotics, such as nitrofurantoin and sulfa drugs, Heart medicines, such as amiodarone,  Chemotherapy  drugs such as bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate, Immunotherapy drugs that are used to treat cancer, Street drugs, </Answer>
