			<Question qid="0001717-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Gestational age</Question>
			<Answer>Gestational age can be determined before or after birth. Before birth, your health care provider will use ultrasound to measure the size of the baby's head, abdomen, and thigh bone. This provides a view on how well the baby is growing in the womb., After birth, gestational age can be measured by looking at the baby's weight, length,  head circumference , vital signs, reflexes, muscle tone, posture, and the condition of the skin and hair. ,  If the baby's gestational age findings after birth match the calendar age, the baby is said to be appropriate for gestational age (AGA). AGA babies have lower rates of problems and death than babies that are small or large for their gestational age. The weight for full-term infants that are born AGA will most often be between 2,500 grams (about 5.5 lbs or 2.5 kg) and 4,000 grams (about 8.75 lbs or 4 kg). Infants weighing less are considered  small for gestational age (SGA) ., Infants weighing more are considered  large for gestational age (LGA) . , </Answer>
