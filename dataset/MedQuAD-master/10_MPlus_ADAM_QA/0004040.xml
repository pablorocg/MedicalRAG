			<Question qid="0004040-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Trisomy 13 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Trisomy 13 (also called Patau syndrome) is a genetic disorder in which a person has 3 copies of genetic material from  chromosome  13, instead of the usual 2 copies. Rarely, the extra material may be attached to another chromosome (translocation).</Answer>
	</QAPair>
	<QAPair pid="2">
			<Question qid="0004040-2" qtype="causes">What causes Trisomy 13 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Trisomy 13 occurs when extra DNA from chromosome 13 appears in some or all of the body's cells. 
   Trisomy 13: the presence of an extra (third) chromosome 13 in all of the cells.
   , 
   Mosaic trisomy 13: the presence of an extra chromosome 13 in some of the cells.
   , 
   Partial trisomy 13: the presence of a part of an extra chromosome 13 in the cells.
   ,  The extra material interferes with normal development. Trisomy 13 occurs in about 1 out of every 10,000 newborns. Most cases are not passed down through families (inherited). Instead, the events that lead to trisomy 13 occur in either the sperm or the egg that forms the fetus.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004040-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Trisomy 13 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Symptoms include: Cleft lip or palate , Clenched hands (with outer fingers on top of the inner fingers), Close-set eyes -- eyes may actually fuse together into one, Decreased muscle tone, Extra fingers or toes ( polydactyly ), Hernias:  umbilical hernia ,  inguinal hernia , Hole, split, or cleft in the iris ( coloboma ), Low-set ears,  Intellectual disability , severe, Scalp defects (missing skin),  Seizures ,  Single palmar crease ,  Skeletal (limb) abnormalities , Small eyes, Small head ( microcephaly ), Small lower jaw ( micrognathia ), Undescended testicle ( cryptorchidism ), </Answer>

			<Question qid="0004040-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Trisomy 13 ?</Question>
			<Answer>The infant may have a single umbilical artery at birth. There are often signs of  congenital heart disease , such as: Abnormal placement of the heart toward the right side of the chest instead of the left ,  Atrial septal defect ,  Patent ductus arteriosus ,  Ventricular septal defect ,  Gastrointestinal x-rays or ultrasound may show rotation of the internal organs. MRI or CT scans of the head may reveal a problem with the structure of the brain. The problem is called holoprosencephaly. It is the joining together of the 2 sides of the brain. Chromosome studies  show trisomy 13, trisomy 13 mosaicism, or partial trisomy. Rarely, the extra material may be attached to another chromosome (translocation).</Answer>

	<QAPair pid="5">
			<Question qid="0004040-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Trisomy 13 ?</Question>
			<Answer>There is no specific treatment for trisomy 13. Treatment varies from child to child and depends on the specific symptoms.</Answer>
	</QAPair>
	<QAPair pid="6">
			<Question qid="0004040-6" qtype="support groups">Where to find support for people with Trisomy 13 ?</Question>
			<Answer>More information and support for people with Trisomy 13 condition and their families can be found at: Support Organization for Trisomy 18, 13 and Related Disorders (SOFT):  trisomy.org , Hope for Trisomy 13 and 18:  www.hopefortrisomy13and18.org , </Answer>

	<QAPair pid="7">
			<Question qid="0004040-7" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Trisomy 13 ?</Question>
			<Answer>More than 90% of children with trisomy 13 die in the first year.</Answer>
	</QAPair>
	<QAPair pid="8">
			<Question qid="0004040-8" qtype="complications">What are the complications of Trisomy 13 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Complications begin almost immediately. Most infants with trisomy 13 have congenital heart disease.  Complications may include: Breathing difficulty or lack of breathing (apnea) ,  Deafness ,  Feeding problems ,  Heart failure ,  Seizures ,  Vision problems , </Answer>

	<QAPair pid="9">
			<Question qid="0004040-9" qtype="when to contact a medical professional">Do I need to see a doctor for Trisomy 13 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Contact your health care provider if you have had a child with trisomy 13 and you plan to have another child. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition, the risk of inheriting it, and how to care for the person.</Answer>
	</QAPair>
	<QAPair pid="10">
			<Question qid="0004040-10" qtype="prevention">How to prevent Trisomy 13 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Trisomy 13 can be diagnosed before birth by  amniocentesis  with chromosome studies of the amniotic cells. Parents of infants with trisomy 13 that is caused by a translocation should have genetic testing and counseling. This may help them be aware of the chances of having another child with the condition.</Answer>
