			<Question qid="0003535-2" qtype="causes">What causes Serotonin syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Serotonin syndrome most often occurs when two or more medicines or drugs that affect the body's level of serotonin are taken together at the same time. The medicines cause too much serotonin to be released or to remain in the brain area. For example, you can develop this syndrome if you take  migraine  medicines called triptans together with antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs). Common SSRIs include citalopram (Celexa), sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and escitalopram (Lexapro). SSNRIs include duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq), milnacipran (Savella), and levomilnacipran (Fetzima). Common triptans include sumatriptan (Imitrex), zolmitriptan (Zomig), frovatriptan (Frova), rizatriptan (Maxalt), almotriptan (Axert), naratriptan (Amerge), and eletriptan (Relpax). If you take these medicines, be sure to read the warning on the packaging. It tells you about the potential risk of serotonin syndrome. However, do not stop taking your medicine. Talk to your doctor about your concerns first. Serotonin syndrome is more likely to occur when you first start taking or increase the dose of the medicine.. Older antidepressants called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can also cause serotonin syndrome when combined with the medicines described above, as well as meperidine (Demerol, a painkiller), fentanyl, dextromethorphan (cough medicine), and others. Street drugs, such as methamphetamine or other  amphetamines ,  cocaine , opiates, ecstasy,  LSD , and others have also been associated with serotonin syndrome.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003535-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Serotonin syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>The diagnosis is usually made by asking the person questions about medical history, including the types of medicines they take. To be diagnosed with serotonin syndrome, the person must have been taking a drug that changes the body's serotonin level (serotonergic drug) and have at least three of the following signs or symptoms: Agitation , Abnormal eye movements called 'ocular clonus', Heavy sweating not due to activity, Fever, Mental status changes, such as  confusion  or hypomania, Muscle spasms (myoclonus), Overactive reflexes ( hyperreflexia ), Shivering, Tremor, Uncoordinated movements (ataxia) ,  Serotonin syndrome is not diagnosed until all other likely causes have been ruled out. This may include infections, intoxication, metabolic and hormone problems, and drug or alcohol withdrawal. Some symptoms of SS can mimic those due to an overdose of cocaine, lithium, or an MAOI. If a person has just started taking or increased the dosage of a tranquilizer (neuroleptic drug), other conditions such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) will be considered. Tests may include: Blood cultures (to check for infection),  Complete blood count  (CBC),  CT scan of the brain ,  Drug (toxicology) and alcohol screen ,  Electrolyte levels ,  Electrocardiogram (ECG) , Kidney and liver function tests,  Thyroid function tests , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003535-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Serotonin syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>People with serotonin syndrome will usually stay in the hospital for at least 24 hours for close observation. Treatment may include: Benzodiazepine medicines, such as diazepam (Valium) or lorazepam (Ativan) to decrease agitation, seizure-like movements, and muscle stiffness, Cyproheptadine (Periactin), a drug that blocks serotonin production, Intravenous (through the vein) fluids, Stopping medicines that caused the syndrome ,  In life-threatening cases, medicines that keep the muscles still (paralyze them), and a temporary breathing tube and breathing machine will be needed to prevent further muscle damage.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003535-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Serotonin syndrome ?</Question>

	<QAPair pid="7">
			<Question qid="0003535-7" qtype="complications">What are the complications of Serotonin syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Uncontrolled muscle spasms can cause severe muscle breakdown. The products produced when the muscles break down are released into the blood and eventually go through the kidneys. This can cause severe kidney damage if not recognized and treated properly.</Answer>
