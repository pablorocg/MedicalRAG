			<Question qid="0002360-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Leaving the hospital - your discharge plan</Question>
			<Answer>After a serious illness, leaving the hospital is your next step toward recovery. Depending on your condition, you may be going home or to another facility for further care.  Before you go, it is a good idea to create a list of things you will need or need to do once you leave. This is called a discharge plan. Your health care providers at the hospital will work on this plan with you and your family or friends. This plan can help you get the right care after you leave and prevent a return trip to the hospital.</Answer>
