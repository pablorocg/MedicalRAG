The swelling can damage nerve fibers. This can cause short or long-term loss of vision.  Conditions that have been linked with optic neuritis include: Autoimmune diseases , including  lupus ,  sarcoidosis , and Beh&#231;et disease,  Cryptococcosis , a fungal infection, Bacterial infections, including tuberculosis, syphilis,  Lyme disease , and  meningitis , Viral infections, including viral  encephalitis ,  measles ,  rubella ,  chickenpox ,  herpes zoster ,  mumps , and mononucleosis, Respiratory infections, including  mycoplasma pneumonia  and other common upper respiratory tract infections,  Multiple sclerosis , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002863-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Optic neuritis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Vision often returns to normal within 2 to 3 weeks with no treatment. Corticosteroids given through a vein (IV) or taken by mouth (oral) may speed up recovery. However, the final vision is no better with steroids than without. Oral steroids may actually increase the chance of recurrence. If tests suggest that there is also multiple sclerosis, certain forms of interferon may be helpful. Further tests may be needed to try to find the cause of the neuritis. If there is a condition causing the problem, it may be able to be treated.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002863-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Optic neuritis ?</Question>
			<Answer>When optic neuritis occurs without other diseases, there is a better prognosis. An MRI is an important test because it can help predict if multiple sclerosis or other similar autoimmune diseases are present or may develop. Optic neuritis caused by multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases has a poorer outlook. However, vision in the affected eye may still return to normal.</Answer>
