			<Question qid="0001613-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is scar tissue in the filtering unit of the kidney. This structure is called the glomerulus. The glomeruli serve as filters that help the body get rid of harmful substances. Each kidney has thousands of glomeruli.  "Focal" means that some of the glomeruli become scarred. Others remain normal. "Segmental" means that only part of an individual glomerulus is damaged.</Answer>
