			<Question qid="0002298-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Knee joint replacement ?</Question>
			<Answer>The results of a total knee replacement are often excellent. The operation relieves pain for most people. Most people do not need help walking after they fully recover. Over 90 percent of artificial knee joints last over 15 years. Some last as long as 25 years before they loosen and need to be replaced again. Total knee replacements can be replaced again if they get loose or wear out. However, in most cases the results are not as good as the first time. It is important not to have the surgery too early so you will need another surgery at a young age or have it too late when you will not benefit the most. After surgery, you should have periodic check ups with your surgeon to make sure the parts of your artificial joint are in good position and condition.</Answer>
