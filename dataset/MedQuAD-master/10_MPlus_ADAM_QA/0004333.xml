			<Question qid="0004333-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about X-ray</Question>
			<Answer>X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation, just like visible light.  An x-ray machine sends individual x-ray waves through the body. The images are recorded on a computer or film. Structures that are dense (such as bone) will block most of the x-ray waves, and will appear white. , Metal and contrast media (special dye used to highlight areas of the body) will also appear white. , Structures containing air will be black, and muscle, fat, and fluid will appear as shades of gray., </Answer>
