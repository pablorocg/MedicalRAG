			<Question qid="0004051-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Tubal ligation</Question>
			<Answer>Tubal ligation is surgery to close a woman's fallopian tubes. (It is sometimes called "tying the tubes.") The fallopian tubes connect the ovaries to the uterus. A woman who has this surgery can no longer get pregnant. This means she is "sterile."</Answer>
