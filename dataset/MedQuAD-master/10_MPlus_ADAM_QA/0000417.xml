			<Question qid="0000417-2" qtype="considerations">What to do for Belching ?</Question>
			<Answer>Belching is a normal process. The purpose of belching is to release air from the stomach. Every time you swallow, you also swallow air, along with fluid or food. The buildup of air in the upper stomach causes the stomach to stretch. This triggers the muscle at the lower end of the esophagus (the tube that runs from your mouth to the stomach) to relax. Air is allowed to escape up the esophagus and out the mouth. Depending on the cause of the belching, it may occur more often, last longer, be more forceful. Symptoms such as nausea,  dyspepsia , and  heartburn  may be relieved by belching.</Answer>
