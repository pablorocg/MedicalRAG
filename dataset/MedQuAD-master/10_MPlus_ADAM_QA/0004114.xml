			<Answer>You may need 2 or 3 more injections to get good results. If the material moves away from the spot where it was injected, you may need more treatments in the future. Implants can help most men who have had transurethral resection of the prostate ( TURP ). Implants help about one half of men who have had their prostate gland removed to treat prostate cancer.</Answer>
