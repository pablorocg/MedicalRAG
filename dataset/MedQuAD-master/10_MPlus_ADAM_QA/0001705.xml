			<Question qid="0001705-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Genes</Question>
			<Answer>Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your  chromosomes . Chromosomes have matching strands of DNA that make specific genes. Except for the sex chromosomes (X and Y), chromosomes are paired so there are 2 genes, 1 on each chromosome. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes., Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together.,  Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as  sickle cell anemia , can be caused by a change in a single gene. </Answer>
