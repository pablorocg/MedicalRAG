			<Question qid="0000535-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Brain PET scan</Question>
			<Answer>A brain positron emission tomography (PET) scan is an imaging test of the brain. It uses a radioactive substance called a tracer to look for disease or injury in the brain. A PET scan shows how the brain and its tissues are working. Other imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and computed tomography ( CT ) scans only reveal the structure of the brain and its surrounding tissues.</Answer>
