			<Question qid="0002113-2" qtype="causes">What causes Hypothyroidism ?</Question>
			<Answer>The thyroid gland is an important organ of the  endocrine system . It is located at the front of the neck, just above where your collarbones meet. The thyroid makes hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is called  metabolism . Hypothyroidism is more common in women and people over age 50. The most common cause of hypothyroidism is thyroiditis. In people with thyroiditis, swelling and inflammation damage the thyroid gland's cells.  Causes of this problem include:  The immune system attacking the thyroid gland, Viral infections (common cold) or other respiratory infections, Pregnancy (often called postpartum thyroiditis) ,  Other causes of hypothyroidism include: Certain medicines, such as lithium and amiodarone, and some types of  chemotherapy , Congenital (birth) defects, Radiation treatments to the neck or brain to treat different cancers, Radioactive iodine used to treat an overactive thyroid gland, Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland,  Sheehan syndrome , a condition that may occur in a woman who bleeds severely during pregnancy or childbirth and causes the destruction of the pituitary gland (which regulates the thyroid gland),  Pituitary tumor  or pituitary surgery , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002113-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Hypothyroidism ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment is aimed at replacing the thyroid hormone you are lacking.  Levothyroxine is the most commonly used medicine:  You will be prescribed the lowest dose possible that relieves your symptoms and brings your blood thyroid hormone levels back to normal., If you have heart disease or you are older, your provider may start you on a very small dose., Most people with an underactive thyroid will need to take this medicine for life. , Levothyroxine is usually a pill, but some people with very severe hypothyroidism first need to be treated in the hospital with intravenous levothyroxine (given through a vein).,  When starting you on your medicine, your provider may check your hormone levels every 2 to 3 months. After that, your thyroid hormone levels should be monitored at least once every year. When you are taking thyroid medicine, be aware of the following: Do not stop taking the medicine, even when you feel better. Continue taking it exactly as your provider prescribed., If you change brands of thyroid medicine, let your provider know. Your levels may need to be checked., What you eat can change the way your body absorbs thyroid medicine. Talk with your provider if you are eating a lot of soy products or are on a high-fiber diet., Thyroid medicine works best on an empty stomach and when taken 1 hour before any other medicines. Ask your provider if you should take your medicine at bedtime. Taking it at bedtime may allow your body to absorb the medicine better than taking it in the daytime., Wait at least 4 hours after taking thyroid hormone before you take fiber supplements, calcium, iron, multivitamins, aluminum hydroxide antacids, colestipol, or medicines that bind bile acids. ,  While you are taking thyroid replacement therapy, tell your provider if you have any symptoms that suggest your dose is too high, such as: Anxiety,  Palpitations , Rapid weight loss, Restlessness or shakiness (tremors), Sweating , </Answer>
