			<Question qid="0002145-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Immunizations - diabetes ?</Question>
			<Answer>Immunizations  (vaccines or vaccinations) help protect you from some diseases. When you have diabetes, you're more likely to get severe infections because your immune system doesn't work as well. Vaccines can prevent illnesses that can be very serious and can put you in the hospital. Vaccines usually have an inactive, small part of a certain germ. This germ is often a virus or bacteria. After you get a vaccine, your body learns to attack that virus or bacteria if you are infected. This means you have less of a chance of getting sick than if you did not get the vaccine. Or you may just have a much milder illness. Below are some of the vaccines you need to know about. Ask your health care provider which are right for you.</Answer>
