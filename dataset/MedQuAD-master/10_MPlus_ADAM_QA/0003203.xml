			<Question qid="0003203-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Prenatal care in your third trimester</Question>
			<Answer>The word prenatal means before birth. Trimester means 3 months. A normal pregnancy is around 10 months and has 3 trimesters. Your health care provider may talk about your pregnancy in weeks, rather than months or trimesters. The third trimester goes from week 28 through week 40.</Answer>
