			<Question qid="0003570-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Shoulder separation - aftercare ?</Question>
			<Answer>Shoulder separation is not an injury to the main shoulder joint itself. It is an injury to the top of the shoulder where the collarbone (clavicle) meets the top of the shoulder blade (acromion of the scapula). It is not the same as a shoulder dislocation. A dislocated shoulder occurs when the arm bone comes out of the main shoulder joint.</Answer>
