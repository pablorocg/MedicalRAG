			<Answer>Your body needs cholesterol to work properly. When you have too much cholesterol in your blood, it builds up inside the walls of your arteries (blood vessels), including the ones that go to your heart. This buildup is called plaque. Plaque narrows your arteries and slows or stops the blood flow. This can cause a  heart attack ,  stroke , or other serious heart disease. Below are some questions you may want to ask your health care provider to help you take care of your cholesterol.</Answer>
