			<Question qid="0000414-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Beeswax poisoning</Question>
			<Answer>Beeswax is wax from the honeycomb of bees. Beeswax poisoning occurs when someone swallows beeswax. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
