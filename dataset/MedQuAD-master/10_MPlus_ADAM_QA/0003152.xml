			<Question qid="0003152-2" qtype="causes">What causes Polymyalgia rheumatica ?</Question>
			<Answer>Polymyalgia rheumatica most often occurs in people over 50 years old. The cause is unknown. PMR may occur before or with giant cell arteritis (GCA; also called  temporal arteritis ). This is a condition in which blood vessels that supply blood to the head and eye become inflamed. PMR can sometimes be hard to tell apart from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in an older person. This occurs when tests for rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibody are negative. </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003152-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Polymyalgia rheumatica ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lab tests alone can't diagnose PMR. Most people with this condition have high markers of inflammation, such as the sedimentation rate ( ESR ) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Other test results for this condition include: Abnormal levels of proteins in the blood, Abnormal level of white blood cells,  Anemia  (low blood count) ,  These tests may also be used to monitor your condition. However, imaging tests such as x-rays of the shoulder or hips are not often helpful. These tests may reveal joint damage that is not related to recent symptoms. In difficult cases, ultrasound or MRI of the shoulder may be done. These imaging tests often show bursitis or low levels of joint inflammation.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003152-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Polymyalgia rheumatica ?</Question>
			<Answer>Without treatment, PMR does not get better. However, low doses of corticosteroids (such as prednisone, 10 to 20 mg per day) can markedly ease symptoms, often within a day or two. The dose should then be slowly reduced to a very low level., Treatment needs to continue for 1 to 2 years. In some people, even longer treatment with low doses of prednisone is needed.,  Corticosteroids can cause many side effects such as weight gain, development of diabetes or osteoporosis. You need to be watched closely if you are taking these medicines. If you are at risk for osteoporosis, your health care provider may recommend you take medicines to prevent this condition.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003152-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Polymyalgia rheumatica ?</Question>
			<Answer>For most people, PMR goes away with treatment after 1 to 2 years. You might be able to stop taking medicines after this point, but check with your provider first. For some people, symptoms return after they reduce or stop taking corticosteroids. In these cases, another medicine such as methotrexate or tocilizumab may be needed. Giant cell arteritis may also be present or can develop later. If this is the case, the temporal artery would need to be evaluated and different treatment given. More severe symptoms can make it harder for you to work or take care of yourself at home.</Answer>
