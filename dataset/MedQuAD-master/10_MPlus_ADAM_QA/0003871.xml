			<Question qid="0003871-2" qtype="causes">What causes Temporal arteritis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Giant cell arteritis affects medium-to-large arteries. It causes inflammation, swelling, tenderness, and damage to the blood vessels that supply blood to the head, neck, upper body, and arms. It most commonly occurs in the arteries around the temples (temporal arteries). These arteries branch off from the carotid artery in the neck. In some cases, the condition can occur in medium-to-large arteries in other places in the body as well. The cause of the condition is unknown. It is believed to be due in part to a faulty  immune response . The disorder has been linked to some infections and to certain genes. Giant cell arteritis is more common in people with another inflammatory disorder known as  polymyalgia rheumatica . Giant cell arteritis almost always occurs in people over age 50.

			<Question qid="0003871-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Temporal arteritis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Getting prompt treatment can help prevent severe problems such as blindness or stroke. When giant cell arteritis is suspected, you will receive corticosteroids, such as prednisone, by mouth. These medicines are often started even before a biopsy is done. You may also be told to take aspirin. Most people begin to feel better within a few days after starting treatment. The dose of corticosteroids will be cut back very slowly. However, you will need to take medicine for 1 to 2 years. If the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is made, in most people a biologic medicine called tocilizumab will be added. This medicine reduces the amount of corticosteroids needed to control the disease. Long-term treatment with corticosteroids can make bones thinner and increase your chance of a fracture. You will need to take the following steps to protect your bone strength. Avoid smoking and excess alcohol intake., Take extra calcium and vitamin D (based on your provider's advice)., Start walking or other forms of weight-bearing exercises., Have your bones checked with a  bone mineral density  (BMD) test or DEXA scan., Take a bisphosphonate medicine, such as alendronate (Fosamax), as prescribed by your provider., </Answer>
