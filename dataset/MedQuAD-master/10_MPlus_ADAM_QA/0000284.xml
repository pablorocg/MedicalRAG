			<Question qid="0000284-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Aortic angiography</Question>
			<Answer>Aortic angiography is a procedure that uses a special dye and x-rays to see how blood flows through the aorta. The aorta is the major artery. It carries blood out of the heart, and through your abdomen or belly. Angiography uses  x-rays  and a special dye to see the insides of the arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.</Answer>
