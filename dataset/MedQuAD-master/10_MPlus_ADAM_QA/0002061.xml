			<Question qid="0002061-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Hydrocodone and acetaminophen overdose ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hydrocodone is a painkiller in the opioid family (related to morphine). Acetaminophen is an over-the-counter medicine used to treat pain and inflammation. They may be combined in one prescription medicine to treat pain. An overdose occurs when someone takes more than the recommended amount of this medicine. The treatment of this overdose must consider both the opioid and acetaminophen components. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual  overdose . If you or someone you are with overdoses, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002061-8" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Hydrocodone and acetaminophen overdose ?</Question>
			<Answer>How well you do depends on how much hydrocodone and acetaminophen you swallowed and how quickly you receive treatment. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. You may need to stay in the hospital to receive more doses of the medicine that reverses the effects of the drug. Complications may cause permanent disability. These possible complications are: Pneumonia, Muscle damage from lying on a hard surface for a prolonged period of time, Brain damage from lack of oxygen, Kidney injury or failure, Liver damage or failure,  If there are no complications, long-term effects and death are rare. If you receive medical attention before serious breathing problems occur, you should have few long-term health problems, and will probably be back to normal within several days. A person may survive the hydrocodone overdose and still have serious injury from the acetaminophen, including liver failure. This, might require a liver transplant.</Answer>
