			<Question qid="0004270-2" qtype="causes">What causes Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>The  adrenal glands  are two triangle-shaped glands. One gland is located on top of each kidney. The adrenal glands produce and release different hormones that the body needs to function normally. The adrenal glands can be affected by many diseases, such as infections like WFS.

			<Answer>Symptoms occur suddenly. They are due to the bacteria growing in large numbers inside the body. Symptoms include: Fever and chills, Joint and muscle pain, Headache, Vomiting ,  The infection with bacteria causes bleeding throughout the body, which causes: A rash throughout the body,  Disseminated intravascular coagulation  in which small blood clots cut off blood supply to the organs,  Septic shock ,  Bleeding into the adrenal glands makes the glands unable to produce enough adrenal hormones. This is called adrenal crisis, and it leads to symptoms such as: Dizziness, weakness, Very low blood pressure, Very fast heart rate, Confusion or coma , </Answer>
