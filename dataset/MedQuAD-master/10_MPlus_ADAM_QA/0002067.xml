			<Answer>Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine available only with a prescription. It is used to treat symptoms of  allergies  and motion sickness.

DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with has an  overdose , call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>

			<Answer>Recovery is likely if the person survives the first 24 hours. Complications such as pneumonia, muscle damage from lying on a hard surface for a prolonged period of time, or brain damage from lack of oxygen may cause permanent disability. Few people actually die from an antihistamine overdose, unless they have serious heart rhythm disturbances or breathing problems.
