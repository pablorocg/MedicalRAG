			<Answer>The health care provider will listen to your chest with a stethoscope. Crackle-like sounds, called rales, may be heard. Rales suggest inflammation of the lung tissue. A  complete blood count  (CBC) test may show increased white blood cells, particularly  eosinophils . Chest x-ray  usually shows abnormal shadows called infiltrates. They may disappear with time or reappear in different areas of the lung. A  bronchoscopy  with washing usually shows a large number of eosinophils. A procedure that removes the stomach contents ( gastric lavage ) may show signs of the ascaris worm or another parasite.</Answer>
