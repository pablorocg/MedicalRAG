			<Question qid="0001815-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Hardware removal - extremity</Question>
			<Answer>Surgeons use hardware such as pins, plates, or screws to help fix a broken bone, torn tendon, or to correct an abnormality in a bone. Most often, this involves bones of the legs, arms, or spine. Later, if you have pain or other problems related to the hardware, you may have surgery to remove the hardware. This is called hardware removal surgery.</Answer>
