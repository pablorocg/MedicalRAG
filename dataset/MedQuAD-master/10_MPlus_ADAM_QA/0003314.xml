			<Question qid="0003314-2" qtype="causes">What causes Q fever - early ?</Question>
			<Answer>Q fever is caused by the bacteria  Coxiella burnetii , which live in domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, birds, and cats. Some wild animals and  ticks  also carry these bacteria. You can get Q fever by drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk, or after breathing in dust or droplets in the air that are contaminated with infected animal feces, blood, or birth products. People at risk for infection include slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, researchers, food processors, and sheep and cattle workers. Men are infected more often than women. Most people who get Q fever are between 30 and 70 years old. In rare cases, the disease affects children, especially those who live on a farm. In infected children younger than 3 years old, Q fever is usually noticed while looking for the cause of  pneumonia .</Answer>
