			<Question qid="0001679-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Gastric bypass surgery</Question>
			<Answer>Gastric bypass is surgery that helps you lose weight by changing how your stomach and small intestine handle the food you eat. After the surgery, your stomach will be smaller. You will feel full with less food. The food you eat will no longer go into some parts of your stomach and small intestine that absorb food. Because of this, your body will not get all of the calories from the food you eat.</Answer>
