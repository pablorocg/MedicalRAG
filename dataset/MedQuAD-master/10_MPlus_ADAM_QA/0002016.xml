			<Answer>Pneumonia  is a common illness. It is caused by many different germs. Pneumonia that starts in the hospital tends to be more serious than other lung infections because: People in the hospital are often very sick and cannot fight off germs., The types of germs present in a hospital are often more dangerous and more resistant to treatment than those outside in the community. ,  Pneumonia occurs more often in people who are using a ventilator, which is a machine that helps them breathe. This is called ventilator-associated pneumonia. Hospital-acquired pneumonia can also be spread by health care workers, who can pass germs from their hands, clothes, or instruments from one person to another. This is why hand-washing, wearing gowns, and using other safety measures is so important in the hospital. People can be more likely to get pneumonia while in the hospital if they: Use alcohol excessively, Have had chest surgery or other major surgery, Have a weak immune system from cancer treatment, certain medicines, or severe wounds, Have long-term (chronic)  lung disease , Breathe saliva or food into their lungs as a result of not being fully alert or having swallowing problems (for example, after a stroke), Are not mentally alert due to medicines or illness, Are older, Are on a breathing machine (ventilator), </Answer>
