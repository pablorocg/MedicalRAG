			<Question qid="0001339-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Echocardiogram - children</Question>
			<Answer>An echocardiogram is a test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart. It is used with children to help diagnose defects of the heart that are present at birth (congenital). The picture is more detailed than a regular  x-ray  image. An echocardiogram also does not expose children to radiation.</Answer>
