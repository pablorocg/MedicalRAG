			<Question qid="0000273-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Antihistamines for allergies ?</Question>
			<Answer>An allergy is an immune response, or reaction, to substances (allergens) that are usually not harmful. In someone with allergies, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms. One type of medicine that helps relieve allergy symptoms is an antihistamine.</Answer>
