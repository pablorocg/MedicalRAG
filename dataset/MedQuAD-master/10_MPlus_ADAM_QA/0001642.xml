			<Question qid="0001642-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Foxglove poisoning</Question>
			<Answer>Foxglove poisoning most often occurs from sucking the flowers or eating the seeds, stems, or leaves of the foxglove plant. Poisoning may also occur from taking more than the recommended amounts of medicines made from foxglove. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
