			<Answer>Quick-relief medicines for  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD) work quickly to help you breathe better. You take them when you are coughing, wheezing, or having trouble breathing, such as during a  flare-up . For this reason, they are also called rescue drugs. The medical name of these drugs is bronchodilators, meaning medicines that open the airways (bronchi). They relax the muscles of your airways and open them up for easier breathing. You and your health care provider can make a plan for the quick-relief drugs that work for you. This plan will include when you should take your medicine and how much you should take. Follow instructions on how to use your medicines the right way. Make sure you get your medicine refilled before you run out.</Answer>
