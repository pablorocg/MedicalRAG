			<Answer>A laceration is a cut that goes all the way through the skin. A small cut can be cared for at home. A large cut needs medical attention right away. If the cut is large, it may need stitches or staples to close the wound and stop the bleeding. It is important to take care of the injury site after the doctor or health care provider applies the stitches. This helps prevent infection and allows the wound to heal properly.</Answer>
