			<Question qid="0002133-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Ileostomy - caring for your stoma</Question>
			<Answer>You had an injury or disease in your digestive system and needed an operation called an ileostomy. The operation changes the way your body gets rid of waste (stool, feces, or poop). Now you have an opening called a stoma in your belly. Waste will pass through the stoma into a pouch that collects it. You will need to take care of your stoma and  empty the pouch  several times a day.</Answer>
