			<Question qid="0000623-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about C-reactive protein</Question>
			<Answer>C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced by the liver. The level of CRP rises when there is inflammation in the body. It is one of a group of proteins, called acute phase reactants that go up in response to inflammation. The levels of acute phase reactants increase in response to certain inflammatory proteins called cytokines. These proteins are produced by white blood cells during inflammation. This article discusses the blood test done to measure the amount of CRP in your blood.</Answer>
