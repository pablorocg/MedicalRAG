			<Question qid="0002875-2" qtype="causes">What causes Osgood-Schlatter disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Osgood-Schlatter disease is thought to be caused by small injuries to the knee area from overuse before the knee is finished growing.  The quadriceps muscle is a large, strong muscle on the front part of the upper leg. When this muscle squeezes (contracts), it straightens the knee. The quadriceps muscle is an important muscle for running, jumping, and climbing. When the quadriceps muscle is used a lot in sports activities during a child's growth spurt, this area becomes irritated or swollen and causes pain. It is common in adolescents who play soccer, basketball, and volleyball, and who participate in gymnastics. Osgood-Schlatter disease affects more boys than girls.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002875-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Osgood-Schlatter disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Your health care provider can tell if you have this condition by doing a physical exam. A  bone x-ray  may be normal, or it may show swelling or damage to the tibial tubercle. This is a bony bump below the knee. X-rays are rarely used unless the provider wants to check for other causes of the pain.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002875-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Osgood-Schlatter disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Osgood-Schlatter disease will almost always go away on its own once the child stops growing. Treatment includes: Resting the knee and decreasing activity when symptoms develop, Putting ice over the painful area 2 to 4 times a day, and after activities, Taking ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or acetaminophen (Tylenol) ,  In many cases, the condition will get better using these methods. Adolescents may play sports if the activity does not cause too much pain. However, symptoms will get better faster if activity is limited. Sometimes, a child will need to take a break from most or all sports for 2 or more months. Rarely, a cast or brace may be used to support the leg until it heals if symptoms do not go away. This most often takes 6 to 8 weeks. Crutches may be used for walking to keep weight off the painful leg. Surgery may be needed in rare cases.</Answer>
