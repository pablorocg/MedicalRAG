			<Question qid="0003025-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Peripheral arterial line - infants</Question>
			<Answer>A peripheral arterial line (PAL) is a tiny, short, flexible catheter that is put through the skin into an artery of the arm or leg. Health care providers sometimes call it an "art line" or "a pal." This article addresses PALs in babies. WHY IS A PAL USED? Providers use a PAL to watch your baby's blood pressure. A PAL can also be used to take frequent blood samples, rather than having to draw blood from a baby repeatedly. A PAL is often needed if a baby has: Severe lung and/or heart disease and is on a ventilator and/or other life support (for example, ECMO), Low blood pressure requiring medicine, Prolonged illness or immaturity requiring frequent blood tests,  HOW IS A PAL PLACED? First, the provider cleans the baby's skin with a germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). Then the small catheter is put into the artery. The PAL is then connected to an IV fluid bag and blood pressure monitor. WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF A PAL? Risks include: The greatest risk is that the PAL can stop blood from going to the hand or foot. Testing before the PAL is placed can prevent this complication in most cases. The  NICU nurses  will carefully watch your baby for this problem., PALs have a greater risk for bleeding than standard IVs., There is a small risk for infection, but it is lower than the risk from a standard IV., </Answer>
