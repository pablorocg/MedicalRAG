			<Question qid="0001951-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Hereditary fructose intolerance ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hereditary fructose intolerance is a disorder in which a person lacks the protein needed to break down fructose. Fructose is a fruit sugar that naturally occurs in the body. Man-made fructose is used as a sweetener in many foods, including baby food and drinks.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001951-2" qtype="causes">What causes Hereditary fructose intolerance ?</Question>
			<Answer>This condition occurs when the body is missing an enzyme called aldolase B. This substance is needed to break down fructose. If a person without this substance eats fructose or sucrose (cane or beet sugar, table sugar), complicated chemical changes occur in the body. The body cannot change its stored form of sugar (glycogen) into glucose. As a result, blood sugar falls and dangerous substances build up in the liver. Hereditary fructose intolerance is inherited, which means it can be passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the aldolase B gene, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of being affected. </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001951-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Hereditary fructose intolerance ?</Question>
			<Answer>Symptoms can be seen after a baby starts eating food or formula. The early symptoms of fructose intolerance are similar to those of  galactosemia  (inability to use the sugar galactose). Later symptoms relate more to liver disease. Symptoms may include: Convulsions , Excessive sleepiness,  Irritability , Yellow skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice), Poor feeding and growth as a baby,  failure to thrive , Problems after eating fruits and other foods that contain fructose or sucrose,  Vomiting , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001951-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Hereditary fructose intolerance ?</Question>
			<Answer>Physical examination may show: Enlarged liver and spleen, Jaundice,  Tests that confirm the diagnosis include: Blood clotting tests,  Blood sugar test , Enzyme studies, Genetic testing,  Kidney function tests ,  Liver function tests ,  Liver biopsy ,  Uric acid blood test ,  Urinalysis ,  Blood sugar will be low, especially after receiving fructose or sucrose. Uric acid levels will be high.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001951-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Hereditary fructose intolerance ?</Question>
			<Answer>Removing fructose and sucrose from the diet is an effective treatment for most people. Complications may be treated. For example, some people can take a medicine to lower the level of uric acid in their blood and decrease their risk for gout.</Answer>

	<QAPair pid="6">
			<Question qid="0001951-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Hereditary fructose intolerance ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hereditary fructose intolerance may be mild or severe. Avoiding fructose and sucrose helps most children with this condition.&#160;The prognosis is good in most cases. A few children with a severe form of the disease will develop severe liver disease. Even removing fructose and sucrose from the diet may not prevent severe liver disease in these children. How well a person does depends on: How soon the diagnosis is made, How soon fructose and sucrose can be removed from the diet, How well the enzyme works in the body , </Answer>

	<QAPair pid="7">
			<Question qid="0001951-7" qtype="complications">What are the complications of Hereditary fructose intolerance ?</Question>
			<Answer>These complications may occur: Avoidance of fructose-containing foods due to their effects, Bleeding, Gout, Illness from eating foods containing fructose or sucrose, Liver failure, Low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ),  Seizures , Death , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001951-8" qtype="when to contact a medical professional">Do I need to see a doctor for Hereditary fructose intolerance ?</Question>
			<Answer>Contact your health care provider if your child develops symptoms of this condition after feeding starts. If your child has this condition, experts recommend seeing a doctor who specializes in biochemical genetics or metabolism.</Answer>

	<QAPair pid="9">
			<Question qid="0001951-9" qtype="prevention">How to prevent Hereditary fructose intolerance ?</Question>
			<Answer>Couples with a family history of fructose intolerance who wish to have a baby may consider genetic counseling. Most of the damaging effects of the disease can be prevented by decreasing fructose and sucrose intake.</Answer>
