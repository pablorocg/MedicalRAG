			<Question qid="0003980-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Total parenteral nutrition</Question>
			<Answer>Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a method of feeding that bypasses the gastrointestinal tract. A special formula given through a vein provides most of the nutrients the body needs. The method is used when someone can't or shouldn't receive feedings or fluids by mouth. A person may need TPN for a short time over weeks or months, or for life. It depends on the condition that causes the need for TPN. You'll need to learn how to do TPN feedings at home. You'll also need to know how to care for the tube (catheter) and the skin where the catheter enters the body. Follow any specific instructions your health care provider or nurse gives you. Use the information below as a reminder of what to do.</Answer>
