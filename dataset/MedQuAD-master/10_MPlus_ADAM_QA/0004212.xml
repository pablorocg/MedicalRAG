			<Question qid="0004212-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Ventral hernia repair</Question>
			<Answer>Ventral hernia repair is a procedure to repair a ventral hernia. A ventral hernia is a sac (pouch) formed from the inner lining of your belly (abdomen) that pushes through a hole in the abdominal wall. Ventral hernias often occur at the site of an old surgical cut (incision). This type of hernia is also called an incisional hernia.</Answer>
