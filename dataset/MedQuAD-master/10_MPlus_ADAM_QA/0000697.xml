			<Question qid="0000697-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Carotid artery surgery</Question>
			<Answer>Carotid artery surgery is a procedure to treat  carotid artery disease . The carotid artery brings needed blood to your brain and face. You have one of these arteries on each side of your neck. Blood flow in this artery can become partly or totally blocked by fatty material called plaque. This can reduce the blood supply to your brain and cause a  transient ischemic attack  (TIA) or  stroke . Carotid artery surgery is done to restore proper blood flow to the brain. There are two procedures to treat a carotid artery that has plaque buildup in it. This article focuses on a surgery called carotid endarterectomy. The other method is called  angioplasty with stent placement .</Answer>
