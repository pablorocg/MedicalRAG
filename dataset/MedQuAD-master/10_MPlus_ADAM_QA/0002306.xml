			<Question qid="0002306-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Krabbe disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Krabbe disease is a rare genetic disorder of the nervous system. It is a type of brain disease called leukodystrophy.</Answer>
	</QAPair>

			<Question qid="0002306-2" qtype="causes">What causes Krabbe disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>A defect in the  GALC  gene causes Krabbe disease. People with this gene defect do not make enough of a substance ( enzyme ) called galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase (galactosylceramidase). The body needs this enzyme to make myelin. Myelin surrounds and protects nerve fibers. Without this enzyme, myelin breaks down, brain cells die, and nerves in the brain and other body areas do not work properly. Krabbe disease can develop at various ages: Early-onset Krabbe disease appears in the first months of life. Most children with this form of the disease die before they reach age 2., Late-onset Krabbe disease begins in late childhood or early adolescence. ,  Krabbe disease is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry the nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. It is an  autosomal recessive disorder . This condition is very rare. It is most common among people of Scandinavian descent.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002306-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Krabbe disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Symptoms of early-onset Krabbe disease are: Changing muscle tone from floppy to rigid, Hearing loss that leads to deafness,  Failure to thrive , Feeding difficulties, Irritability and sensitivity to loud sounds, Severe  seizures  (may begin at a very early age), Unexplained fevers, Vision loss that leads to blindness, Vomiting ,  With late onset Krabbe disease, vision problems may appear first, followed by walking difficulties and rigid muscles. Symptoms vary from person to person. Other symptoms may also occur.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002306-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Krabbe disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms. Tests that may be done include: Blood test to look for galactosylceramidase levels in white blood cells,  CSF total protein  -- tests the amount of protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), Genetic testing for the GALC gene defect,  MRI of the head ,  Nerve conduction velocity , </Answer>

	<QAPair pid="5">
			<Question qid="0002306-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Krabbe disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>There is no specific treatment for Krabbe disease. Some people have had a bone marrow transplant in the early stages of the disease, but this treatment has risks.</Answer>

	<QAPair pid="6">
			<Question qid="0002306-6" qtype="support groups">Where to find support for people with Krabbe disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>More information and support for people with Krabbe disease and their families can be found at: National Organization for Rare Disorders --  rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/leukodystrophy-krabbes/s , NIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center --  rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6844/krabbe-disease , United Leukodystrophy Foundation --  ulf.org/ , </Answer>

	<QAPair pid="7">
			<Question qid="0002306-7" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Krabbe disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>The outcome is likely to be poor. On average, infants with early-onset Krabbe disease die before age 2. People who develop the disease at a later age have survived into adulthood with nervous system disease.</Answer>
	</QAPair>
	<QAPair pid="8">
			<Question qid="0002306-8" qtype="complications">What are the complications of Krabbe disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>This disease damages the  central nervous system . It can cause: Blindness, Deafness, Severe problems with muscle tone ,  The disease is usually life-threatening.</Answer>
	</QAPair>
	<QAPair pid="9">
			<Question qid="0002306-9" qtype="when to contact a medical professional">Do I need to see a doctor for Krabbe disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Contact your provider if your child develops symptoms of this disorder. Go to the hospital emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if the following symptoms occur: Seizures,  Loss of consciousness , Abnormal posturing, </Answer>
	</QAPair>
	<QAPair pid="10">
			<Question qid="0002306-10" qtype="prevention">How to prevent Krabbe disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Genetic counseling  is recommended for people with a family history of Krabbe disease who are considering having children. A blood test can be done to see if you carry the gene for Krabbe disease. Prenatal tests ( amniocentesis  or  chorionic villus sampling ) can be done to test a developing baby for this condition.</Answer>
