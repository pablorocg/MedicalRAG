			<Question qid="0003433-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Rotator cuff - self-care</Question>
			<Answer>The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that attach to the bones of the shoulder joint, allowing the shoulder to move in a coordinated and pain-free way and remain stable. The tendons can be torn from overuse, injury, or wearing away over time. Pain relief measures, using the shoulder properly, and shoulder exercises may help ease your symptoms.</Answer>
