			<Answer>Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is a blood test that looks at how long it takes for blood to clot. It can help tell if you have a bleeding problem or if your blood does not clot properly. This test measures the function of a part of the coagulation (clotting) system. A related blood test is  prothrombin time (PT) , which measures the function of a different part of the clotting system.</Answer>
