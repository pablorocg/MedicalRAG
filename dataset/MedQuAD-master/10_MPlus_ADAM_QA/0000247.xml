			<Question qid="0000247-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Anorectal abscess ?</Question>
			<Answer>The problem rarely goes away on its own. Antibiotics alone usually cannot treat an abscess. Treatment involves surgery to open and drain the abscess. Surgery is usually done with local numbing medicine, along with  medicine to make you sleepy . Sometimes,  spinal or general anesthesia  is used., Surgery is most often an outpatient procedure, which means that you go home on the same day. The surgeon cuts open the abscess and drains the pus. Sometimes a drain is put in to keep the incision open and draining, and sometimes the abscess cavity is packed with gauze., If the pus collection is deep, you may need to stay in the hospital longer for pain control and nursing care of the abscess drainage site., After surgery, you may need warm sitz baths (sitting in a tub of warm water). This helps relieve pain and reduce swelling.,  Drained abscesses are usually left open and no stitches are needed. The surgeon may prescribe painkillers and antibiotics. Avoiding constipation will help decrease pain. You may need stool softeners. Drinking fluids and eating foods with lots of fiber can also help.</Answer>
