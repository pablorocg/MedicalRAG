			<Question qid="0002559-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Medicine safety and children</Question>
			<Answer>Every year, many children are brought to the emergency room because they took medicine by accident. A lot of medicine is made to look and taste like candy. Children are curious and attracted to medicine. Most children find the medicine when their parent or caregiver is not looking. You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight. Be very careful if you have toddlers around. </Answer>
