			<Question qid="0003016-2" qtype="causes">What causes Pericarditis - after heart attack ?</Question>
			<Answer>Two types of  pericarditis  can occur after a heart attack. Early pericarditis:  This form most often occurs within 1 to 3 days after a heart attack. Inflammation and swelling develop as the body tries to clean up the damaged heart tissue. Late pericarditis:  This is also called Dressler syndrome. It is also called post-cardiac injury syndrome or postcardiotomy pericarditis). It most often develops several weeks or months after a heart attack, heart surgery, or other trauma to the heart. It can also happen a week after a heart injury. Dressler syndrome is thought to occur when the immune system attacks healthy heart tissue by mistake. Things that put you at higher risk for pericarditis include: A previous heart attack,  Open heart surgery , Chest trauma, A heart attack that has affected the thickness of your heart muscle , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003016-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Pericarditis - after heart attack ?</Question>
			<Answer>The health care provider will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. There may be a rubbing sound (called a pericardial friction rub, not to be confused with a heart murmur).  Heart sounds  in general may be weak or sound far away. A buildup of fluid in the covering of the heart or space around the lungs (pericardial effusion) is not common after a heart attack. But, it often does occur in some people with Dressler syndrome. Tests may include: Cardiac injury markers (CK-MB and  troponin  may help tell  pericarditis  from a heart attack),  Chest CT scan ,  Chest MRI ,  Chest x-ray ,  Complete blood count  (CBC),  ECG  (electrocardiogram),  Echocardiogram ,  ESR  (sedimentation rate) or  C-reactive protein  (measures of inflammation), </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003016-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Pericarditis - after heart attack ?</Question>
			<Answer>The goal of treatment is to make the heart work better and reduce pain and other symptoms. Aspirin may be used to treat inflammation of the pericardium. A drug called colchicine is often used as well. In some cases, excess fluid surrounding the heart (pericardial effusion) may need to be removed. This is done with a procedure called  pericardiocentesis . If complications develop, part of the pericardium may sometimes need to be removed with surgery (pericardiectomy).</Answer>
