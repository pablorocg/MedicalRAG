			<Question qid="0001523-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Factor II deficiency ?</Question>
			<Answer>Prothrombin deficiency is a disorder caused by a lack of a protein in the blood called prothrombin. It leads to problems with blood clotting (coagulation). Prothrombin is also known as factor II (factor two).</Answer>
	</QAPair>

			<Question qid="0001523-2" qtype="causes">What causes Factor II deficiency ?</Question>
			<Answer>When you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves special proteins called coagulation, or clotting, factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning like they should. Prothrombin, or factor II, is one such coagulation factor. Prothrombin deficiency runs in families (inherited) and is very rare. Both parents must have the gene to pass the disorder on to their children. A family history of a bleeding disorder can be a risk factor. Prothrombin deficiency can also be due to another condition or use of certain medicines. This is called acquired prothrombin deficiency. It can be caused by: Lack of  vitamin K  (some babies are born with vitamin K deficiency), Severe  liver disease , Use of medicines that prevent clotting (anticoagulants such as warfarin), </Answer>

	<QAPair pid="5">
			<Question qid="0001523-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Factor II deficiency ?</Question>
			<Answer>Bleeding can be controlled by getting intravenous (IV) infusions of plasma or concentrates of clotting factors. If you lack vitamin K, you can take this vitamin by mouth, through injections under the skin, or through a vein (intravenously). If you have this bleeding disorder, be sure to: Tell your health care providers before you have any kind of procedure, including surgery and dental work., Tell your family members because they may have the same disorder but do not know it yet., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001523-7" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Factor II deficiency ?</Question>
			<Answer>The outcome is good with proper treatment. Inherited prothrombin deficiency is a lifelong condition. The outlook for acquired prothrombin deficiency depends on the cause. If it is caused by liver disease, the outcome depends on how well your liver disease can be treated. Taking vitamin K supplements will treat vitamin K deficiency.</Answer>
