			<Question qid="0004153-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Using crutches</Question>
			<Answer>It is important to start walking as soon as you can after your surgery. But you will need support for walking while your leg heals. Crutches may be a good choice after a leg injury or surgery if you only need a little help with balance and stability. Crutches are also useful when your leg is only a little weak or painful. Talk to your health care provider if you are having a lot of pain, weakness, or problems with balance. A walker may be a better option for you than crutches.</Answer>
