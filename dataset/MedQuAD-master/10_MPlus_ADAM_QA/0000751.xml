			<Question qid="0000751-2" qtype="causes">What causes Cervical spondylosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cervical spondylosis is caused by aging and  chronic  wear on the cervical spine. This includes the disks or cushions between the neck vertebrae and the joints between the bones of the cervical spine. There may be abnormal growths or spurs on the bones of the spine (vertebrae). Over time, these changes can press down on (compress) one or more of the nerve roots. In advanced cases, the spinal cord becomes involved. This can affect your arms, legs, and balance. Everyday wear and tear may start these changes. People who are very active at work or in sports may be more likely to have them. The major risk factor is aging. By age 60, most people show signs of cervical spondylosis on x-ray. Other factors that can make someone more likely to develop spondylosis are: Being overweight and not exercising, Having a job that requires heavy lifting or a lot of bending and twisting, Past neck injury (often several years before), Past spine surgery,  Ruptured or slipped disk , Severe arthritis , Previous surgery on the neck, </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000751-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Cervical spondylosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>A physical exam may show that you have trouble moving your head toward your shoulder and rotating your head. Your provider may ask you to bend your head forward and to each side while putting slight downward pressure on the top of your head. Increased pain or numbness during this test is usually a sign that there is pressure on a nerve in your spine. Weakness of your shoulders and arms or loss of feeling can be signs of damage to certain nerve roots or to the spinal cord.  A spine or  neck x-ray  may be done to look for arthritis or other changes in your spine. MRI  or CT scans of the neck are done when you have: Severe neck or arm pain that does not get better with treatment, Weakness or numbness in your arms or hands ,  Electromyography (EMG)  and  nerve conduction velocity  tests may be done to examine nerve root function. </Answer>
