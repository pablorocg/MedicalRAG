			<Question qid="0001744-2" qtype="causes">What causes Glossopharyngeal neuralgia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN) is believed to be caused by irritation of the ninth cranial nerve, called the glossopharyngeal nerve. Symptoms usually begin in people over age 50. In most cases, the source of irritation is never found. Possible causes for this type of nerve pain (neuralgia) are: Blood vessels pressing on the glossopharyngeal nerve, Growths at the base of the skull pressing on the glossopharyngeal nerve,  Tumors  or infections of the throat and mouth pressing on the glossopharyngeal nerve, </Answer>

Symptoms include severe pain in areas connected to the ninth cranial nerve: Back of the nose and throat (nasopharynx), Back of the tongue, Ear, Throat, Tonsil area, Voice box (larynx),  The pain occurs in episodes and may be severe.

			<Question qid="0001744-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Glossopharyngeal neuralgia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tests will be done to identify problems, such as tumors, at the base of the skull. Tests may include: Blood tests to rule out any infection or tumor,  CT scan  of the head,  MRI of the head ,  X-rays of the head  or neck ,  Sometimes the MRI may show swelling (inflammation) of the glossopharyngeal nerve. To find out whether a blood vessel is pressing on the nerve, pictures of the brain arteries may be taken using: Magnetic resonance angiography  (MRA), CT angiogram, X-rays of the arteries with a dye (conventional angiography) , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001744-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Glossopharyngeal neuralgia ?</Question>
			<Answer>The goal of treatment is to control pain. The most effective drugs are antiseizure medicines such as carbamazepine. Antidepressants may help certain people. In severe cases, when pain is difficult to treat, surgery to take pressure off the glossopharyngeal nerve may be needed. This is called microvascular decompression. The nerve can also be cut (rhizotomy). Both surgeries are effective. If a cause of the neuralgia is found, treatment should control the underlying problem.</Answer>
