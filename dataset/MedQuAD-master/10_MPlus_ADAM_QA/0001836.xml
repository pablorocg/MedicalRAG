			<Answer>Even if you feel fine, you should still see your provider for regular checkups. These visits can help you avoid problems in the future. For example, the only way to find out if you have  high blood pressure  is to have it checked regularly. High blood sugar and  high cholesterol  levels also may not have any symptoms in the early stages. A simple blood test can check for these conditions. There are specific times when you should see your provider or receive specific health screenings. The US Preventive Services Task Force publishes a list of recommended screenings. Below are screening guidelines for women ages 18 to 39. BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENING Your  blood pressure  should be checked at least once every 3 to 5 years if: Your blood pressure is in the normal range (top number less than 120 mm Hg and bottom number less than 80 mm Hg), You don't have risk factors for high blood pressure,  Ask your provider if you need your blood pressure checked more often if: The top number is 120 to 129 mm Hg or the bottom number is 70 to 79 mm Hg, You have diabetes,  heart disease ,  kidney problems , are overweight, or have certain other health conditions, You have a first-degree relative with high blood pressure, You are Black, You had high blood pressure during a pregnancy,  If the top number is 130 mm Hg or greater or the bottom number is 80 mm Hg or greater, this is considered stage 1 hypertension.
