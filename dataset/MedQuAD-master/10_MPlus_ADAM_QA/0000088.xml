			<Question qid="0000088-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Adenomyosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The health care provider will make the diagnosis if a woman has symptoms of adenomyosis that are not caused by other gynecologic problems. The only way to confirm the diagnosis is by examining the tissue of the uterus after a surgery to remove it. During a pelvic exam, the provider may find a soft and slightly enlarged uterus. The exam may also reveal a uterine mass or uterine tenderness. An  ultrasound  of the uterus may be done. However, it may not give a clear diagnosis of adenomyosis. An MRI can help distinguish this condition from other uterine tumors. It is often used when an ultrasound exam does not provide sufficient information to make a diagnosis.</Answer>
