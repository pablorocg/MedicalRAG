			<Answer>Uncoordinated movement is due to&#160;a muscle control problem&#160;that causes&#160;an inability to coordinate movements. It leads to a jerky, unsteady, to-and-fro motion of the middle of the body (trunk) and an  unsteady gait  (walking style). It can also affect the limbs. The medical name of this condition is ataxia.</Answer>
