			<Question qid="0000715-2" qtype="causes">What causes Cavernous sinus thrombosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The cavernous sinus receives blood from veins of the face and brain. The blood drains it into other blood vessels that carry it back to the heart. This area also contains nerves that control vision and eye movements. Cavernous sinus thrombosis is most often caused by a bacterial infection that has spread from the sinuses, teeth, ears, eyes, nose, or skin of the face. You are more likely to develop this condition if you have an increased risk of blood clots.</Answer>
