			<Question qid="0002541-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for McCune-Albright syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>There is no specific treatment for McCune-Albright syndrome. Drugs that block estrogen production, such as testolactone, have been tried with some success. Adrenal abnormalities (such as  Cushing syndrome ) may be treated with surgery to remove the adrenal glands. Gigantism and pituitary adenoma will need to be treated with medicines that block hormone production, or with surgery. Bone abnormalities (fibrous dysplasia) are sometimes removed with surgery. Limit the number of x-rays taken of affected areas of the body.</Answer>
