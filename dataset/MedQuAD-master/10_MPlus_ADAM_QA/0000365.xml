			<Question qid="0000365-2" qtype="causes">What causes Autoimmune disorders ?</Question>
			<Answer>The blood cells in the body's immune system help protect against harmful substances. Examples include bacteria, viruses,  toxins ,  cancer  cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces  antibodies  against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances. When you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and potentially harmful antigens. As a result, your body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues.  The exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders. An autoimmune disorder may result in: The destruction of body tissue, Abnormal growth of an organ, Changes in organ function ,  An autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include: Blood vessels, Connective tissues,  Endocrine  glands such as the thyroid or pancreas, Joints, Muscles, Red blood cells, Skin ,  A person may have more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time. Common autoimmune disorders include: Addison disease ,  Celiac disease - sprue  (gluten-sensitive enteropathy),  Dermatomyositis ,  Graves disease ,  Hashimoto thyroiditis , Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis),  Multiple sclerosis ,  Myasthenia gravis ,  Pernicious anemia ,  Reactive arthritis ,  Rheumatoid arthritis ,  Sj&#246;gren syndrome ,  Systemic lupus erythematosus &#160;(lupus),  Type I diabetes , </Answer>
