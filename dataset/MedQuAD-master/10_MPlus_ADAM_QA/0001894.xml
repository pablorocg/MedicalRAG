			<Question qid="0001894-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Heimlich maneuver on self</Question>
			<Answer>When you are choking, your airway may be blocked so that not enough oxygen reaches the lungs. Without oxygen, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 to 6 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save your life. If you are choking on something, you can perform the Heimlich maneuver on yourself. Follow these steps: Make a fist with&#160;one hand. Place the thumb of that hand below your rib cage and above your navel., Grasp your fist with your other hand. Press your fist forcibly into the upper abdominal area with a quick upward movement.,  You can also lean over a table edge, chair, or railing. Quickly thrust your upper belly area (upper abdomen) against the edge. If you need to, repeat this motion until the object blocking your airway comes out. Choking first aid  is a related topic.
