			<Question qid="0002782-2" qtype="causes">What causes Neurogenic bladder ?</Question>
			<Answer>Several muscles and nerves must work together for the bladder to hold urine until you are ready to empty it. Nerve messages go back and forth between the brain and the muscles that control bladder emptying. If these nerves are damaged by illness or injury, the muscles may not be able to tighten or relax at the right time. Disorders of the central nervous system commonly cause neurogenic bladder. These can include: Alzheimer disease , Birth defects of the spinal cord, such as spina bifida, Brain or spinal cord tumors,  Cerebral palsy ,  Encephalitis , Learning disabilities such as  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD),  Multiple sclerosis &#160;(MS),  Parkinson disease ,  Spinal cord injury ,  Stroke ,  Damage or disorders of the nerves that supply the bladder can also cause this condition. These can include: Nerve damage (neuropathy), Nerve damage due to long-term, heavy alcohol use,  Nerve damage  due to long-term diabetes, 
   Nerve damage due to&#160; vitamin B12  deficiency, Nerve damage from  syphilis , Nerve damage due to pelvic surgery, Nerve damage from a herniated disk or spinal canal stenosis , </Answer>

			<Answer>Medicines may help manage your symptoms. Your health care provider may suggest: Medicines that relax the bladder (for example, oxybutynin, tolterodine, or propantheline), Medicines that make certain nerves more active (bethanechol), Botulinum toxin, GABA supplements, Antiepileptic drugs ,  Your provider may refer you to someone who has been trained to help people manage bladder problems.

Cranberry tablets may help prevent UTIs. Some people may need to use a urinary catheter. This is a thin tube that is inserted into your bladder. You may need a catheter to be: In place all the time (indwelling catheter)., In your bladder 4 to 6 times a day to keep your bladder from becoming too full (intermittent catheterization).,  Sometimes surgery is needed. Surgeries for neurogenic bladder include: Artificial sphincter , Electrical device implanted near the bladder nerves to stimulate the bladder muscles, Sling surgery, Creation of an opening (stoma) in which urine flows into a special pouch (this is called urinary diversion),  Electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve in the leg may be recommended. This involves placing a needle into the tibial nerve. The needle is connected to an electrical device that sends signals to the tibial nerve. The signals then travel up to the nerves in the lower spine, which control the bladder.</Answer>
