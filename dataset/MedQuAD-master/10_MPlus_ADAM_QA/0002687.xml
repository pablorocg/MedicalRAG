			<Question qid="0002687-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Mucormycosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Surgery should be done right away to remove all dead and infected tissue. Surgery can lead to disfiguration because it may involve removal of the palate, parts of the nose, or parts of the eye. But, without such aggressive surgery, chances of survival are greatly decreased. You will also receive antifungal medicine, usually amphotericin B, through a vein. After the infection is under control, you may be switched to a different medicine such as posaconazole or isavuconazole. If you have diabetes, it will be important to get your blood sugar in the normal range.</Answer>
