			<Question qid="0000529-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Brain abscess ?</Question>

			<Question qid="0000529-2" qtype="causes">What causes Brain abscess ?</Question>
			<Answer>Brain abscesses commonly occur when bacteria or fungi infect part of the brain. As a result, swelling and irritation (inflammation) develop. Infected brain cells, white blood cells, live and dead bacteria or fungi collect in an area of the brain. Tissue forms around this area and creates a mass or abscess. The germs that cause a brain abscess can reach the brain through the blood. Or, they enter the brain directly, such as during brain surgery. In some cases, a brain abscess develops from an infection in the sinuses. The source of the infection is often not found. However, the most common identified source is a lung infection. Less often, a heart infection is the cause. The following raise your chance of developing a brain abscess: A weakened immune system (such as in people with  HIV/AIDS ), Chronic disease, such as cancer, Drugs that suppress the immune system (corticosteroids or  chemotherapy ),  Congenital heart disease , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000529-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Brain abscess ?</Question>
			<Answer>A brain and nervous system (neurological) exam will usually show signs of  increased pressure inside the skull  and problems with brain function. Tests to diagnose a brain abscess may include: Blood cultures ,  Chest x-ray , Complete blood count ( CBC ),  Head CT scan , Electroencephalogram ( EEG ),  MRI of head , Testing for the presence of  antibodies  to certain germs ,  A needle  biopsy  is usually performed to identify the cause of the infection.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000529-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Brain abscess ?</Question>
			<Answer>A brain abscess is a medical emergency. Pressure inside the skull may become high enough to be life threatening. You will need to stay in the hospital until the condition is stable. Some people may need life support. Medicine such as an antibiotic, not surgery, is recommended if you have: A small abscess (less than 2 cm), An abscess deep in the brain, An abscess and  meningitis , Several abscesses (rare), Shunts in the brain for  hydrocephalus  (in some cases, the shunt may need to be removed temporarily or replaced), An infection called  toxoplasmosis  in a person with HIV/AIDS ,  You may be prescribed several different types of antibiotics to make sure treatment works. Antifungal medicines may also be prescribed if the infection is likely caused by a fungus. Surgery is needed if: Increased pressure in the brain continues or gets worse, The brain abscess does not get smaller after medicine, The brain abscess contains gas (produced by some types of bacteria), The brain abscess might break open (rupture), The brain abscess is large (more than 2 cm) ,  Surgery consists of opening the skull, exposing the brain, and draining the abscess. Laboratory tests are often done to examine the fluid. This helps identify the cause of the infection, so that the right antibiotics or antifungal medicine can be prescribed. Needle  aspiration  guided by CT or MRI scan may be needed for a deep abscess. During this procedure, medicines may be injected directly into the mass. Certain diuretics (medicines that reduce fluid in the body, also called water pills) and steroids may also be used to reduce the swelling of the brain.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000529-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Brain abscess ?</Question>
			<Answer>If untreated, a brain abscess is almost always deadly. With treatment, the death rate is about 10% to 30%. The earlier treatment is received, the better. Some people may have long-term nervous system problems after a brain abscess or surgery.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000529-7" qtype="complications">What are the complications of Brain abscess ?</Question>
			<Answer>Complications may include: Brain damage, Meningitis that is severe and life threatening, Return (recurrence) of infection, Seizures , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000529-8" qtype="when to contact a medical professional">Do I need to see a doctor for Brain abscess ?</Question>

			<Question qid="0000529-9" qtype="prevention">How to prevent Brain abscess ?</Question>
			<Answer>You can reduce the risk of developing a brain abscess by getting treated for infections or health problems that can cause them.  Some people, including those with certain heart disorders, may receive antibiotics before dental or other procedures to help reduce the risk of infection.</Answer>
