			<Answer>As a new parent, you have many important decisions to make. One is to choose whether to breastfeed your baby or bottle feed using  infant formula . Health experts agree that breastfeeding is the healthiest option for both mom and baby. They recommend that babies feed only on breast milk for the first 6 months, and then continue to have breast milk as a main part of their diet until they are at least 1 and better 2 years old. There are very few health problems that make breastfeeding not possible. There are other reasons women are unable to breastfeed, but with good support and knowledge, most of these can be overcome. Here are some things to consider when deciding about breastfeeding. The decision about how to feed your baby is a personal one, and only you can decide what is best for you and your family.</Answer>
