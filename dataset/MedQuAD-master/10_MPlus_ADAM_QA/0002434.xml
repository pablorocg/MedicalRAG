Normally, the disks provide space and cushion in your spine. If these disks dry out and become thinner and more brittle, you can lose movement in the spine over time. If the spaces between the spinal nerves and spinal cord become narrowed, this can lead to  spinal stenosis . These problems are called degenerative joint or spine disease. Other possible causes of chronic low back pain include: Curvature of the spine, such as  scoliosis  or  kyphosis , Medical problems, such as  fibromyalgia  or  rheumatoid arthritis , Piriformis syndrome, a pain disorder involving a muscle in the buttocks called the piriformis muscle ,  You are at greater risk for low back pain if you: Are over age 30, Are  overweight , Are pregnant, Do not exercise, Feel  stressed  or  depressed , Have a job in which you have to do heavy lifting, bending and twisting, or that involves whole body vibration, such as truck driving or using a sandblaster, Smoke , </Answer>
