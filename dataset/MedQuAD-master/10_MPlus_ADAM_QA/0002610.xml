			<Question qid="0002610-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Metachromatic leukodystrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a genetic disorder that affects nerves, muscles, other organs, and behavior. It slowly gets worse over time.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002610-2" qtype="causes">What causes Metachromatic leukodystrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>MLD is usually caused by the lack of an important  enzyme  called arylsulfatase A (ARSA). Because this enzyme is missing, chemicals called sulfatides build up in the body and damage the nervous system, kidneys, gallbladder, and other organs. In particular, the chemicals damage the protective sheaths that surround nerve cells. The disease is passed down through families (inherited). You must get a copy of the defective gene from both of your parents to have the disease. Parents can each have the defective gene, but not have MLD. A person with one defective gene is called a "carrier." Children who inherit only one defective gene from one parent will be a carrier, but usually will not develop MLD. When two carriers have a child, there is a 1 in 4 chance that the child will get both genes and have MLD. There are three forms of MLD. The forms are based on when the symptoms begin: Late infantile MLD symptoms usually begin by ages 1 to 2., Juvenile MLD symptoms usually begin between ages 4 and 12., Adult (and late-stage juvenile MLD) symptoms may occur between age 14 and adulthood (over age 16), but may begin as late as the 40s or 50s. , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002610-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Metachromatic leukodystrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>Symptoms of MLD may include any of the following: Abnormally high or decreased muscle tone, or abnormal muscle movements, any of which may cause problems walking or frequent falls, Behavior problems, personality changes,  irritability , Decreased mental function, Difficulty swallowing, Inability to perform normal tasks,  Incontinence , Poor school performance,  Seizures , Speech difficulties, slurring, </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002610-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Metachromatic leukodystrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>The health care provider will perform a physical exam, focusing on the nervous system symptoms. Tests that may be done include: Blood or skin culture to look for low arylsulfatase A activity, Blood test to look for low arylsulfatase A enzyme levels, DNA testing for the ARSA gene,  MRI  of the brain,  Nerve biopsy , Nerve signaling studies,  Urinalysis , </Answer>

	<QAPair pid="5">
			<Question qid="0002610-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Metachromatic leukodystrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>There is no cure for MLD. Care focuses on treating the symptoms and preserving the person's quality of life with physical and occupational therapy. Bone marrow transplant may be considered for infantile MLD. Research is studying ways to replace the missing enzyme (arylsulfatase A).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002610-6" qtype="support groups">Where to find support for people with Metachromatic leukodystrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>These groups can provide more information on MLD: National Organization for Rare Disorders -- rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/metachromatic-leukodystrophy , NLM Genetics Home Reference --  ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/metachromatic-leukodystrophy , United Leukodystrophy Foundation --  www.ulf.org , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002610-7" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Metachromatic leukodystrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>MLD is a severe disease that gets worse over time. Eventually, people lose all muscle and mental function. Life span varies, depending on what age the condition started, but the disease course usually runs 3 to 20 years or more. People with this disorder are expected to have a shorter than normal lifespan. The earlier the age at diagnosis, the more quickly the disease progresses.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002610-8" qtype="prevention">How to prevent Metachromatic leukodystrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>Genetic counseling is recommended if you have a family history of this disorder.</Answer>
