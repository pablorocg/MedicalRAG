			<Question qid="0002210-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Interstitial nephritis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment depends on the cause of the problem. Avoiding medicines that lead to this condition may quickly relieve symptoms. Limiting  salt  and fluid in the diet can improve swelling and high blood pressure. Limiting  protein  in the diet can help control the buildup of waste products in the blood ( azotemia ), which can lead to symptoms of acute kidney failure. If dialysis is necessary, it usually is required for only a short time. Corticosteroids or stronger anti-inflammatory medicines such as cyclophosphamide can sometimes be helpful.</Answer>
