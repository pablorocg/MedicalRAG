			<Question qid="0004192-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Vancomycin-resistant enterococci</Question>
			<Answer>Enterococcus is a germ (bacteria). It normally lives in the intestines and in the female genital tract. Most of the time, it does not cause problems. But enterococcus can cause an infection if it gets into the urinary tract, bloodstream, or skin wounds or other sterile sites. Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is often used to treat these infections. Antibiotics are medicines that are used to kill bacteria. Enterococcus germs can become resistant to vancomycin and therefore are not killed. These resistant bacteria are called vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). VRE can be hard to treat because there are fewer antibiotics that can fight the bacteria. Most VRE infections occur in hospitals.</Answer>
