			<Question qid="0001595-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Fire ants</Question>
			<Answer>Fire ants are red-colored insects. A sting from a fire ant delivers a harmful substance, called venom, into your skin. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual fire ant sting. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
