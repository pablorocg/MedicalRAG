			<Question qid="0002540-1" qtype="information">What is (are) McArdle syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Type V (five) glycogen storage disease (GSD V) is a rare inherited condition in which the body is not able to break down glycogen. Glycogen is an important source of energy that is stored in all tissues, especially in the muscles and liver. GSD V is also called McArdle disease.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002540-2" qtype="causes">What causes McArdle syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>GSD V is caused by a flaw in the gene that makes an  enzyme  called muscle glycogen phosphorylase. As a result, the body cannot break down glycogen in the muscles. GSD V is an  autosomal recessive  genetic disorder. This means to have the disorder, you must receive a copy of the nonworking gene from both parents. A person who receives a nonworking gene from only one parent usually does not develop this syndrome. A family history of GSD V increases the risk.</Answer>
