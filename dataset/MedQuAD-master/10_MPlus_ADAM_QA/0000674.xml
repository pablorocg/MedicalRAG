			<Question qid="0000674-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Caplan syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rheumatoid pneumoconiosis (RP, also known as Caplan syndrome) is swelling (inflammation) and scarring of the lungs. It occurs in people with  rheumatoid arthritis  who have breathed in dust, such as from coal ( coal worker's pneumoconiosis ) or  silica .</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000674-2" qtype="causes">What causes Caplan syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>RP is caused by breathing in inorganic dust. This is dust that comes from grinding metals, minerals, or rock. After the dust enters the lungs, it causes inflammation. This can lead to the formation of many small lumps in the lungs and an airway disease similar to mild asthma. It is not clear how RP develops. There are two theories: When people breathe in inorganic dust, it affects their immune system and leads to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is an  autoimmune disease  in which the body's immune system attacks healthy body tissue by mistake., When people who already have RA or are at high risk for it are exposed to mineral dust, they develop RP., </Answer>

			<Answer>Contact your provider for an appointment if you have symptoms of RP and exposure to coal dust. Talk to your provider about getting the flu and pneumonia vaccines. If you've been diagnosed with RP, contact your provider right away if you develop a cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other signs of a lung infection, especially if you think you have the flu. Since your lungs are already damaged, it's very important to have the infection treated promptly. This will prevent breathing problems from becoming severe, as well as further damage to your lungs.</Answer>
