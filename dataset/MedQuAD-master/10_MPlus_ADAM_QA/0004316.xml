			<Question qid="0004316-2" qtype="causes">What causes Wilms tumor ?</Question>
			<Answer>WT is the most common form of childhood kidney cancer. The exact cause of this tumor in most children is unknown. A missing iris of the eye (aniridia) is a birth defect that is sometimes associated with WT. Other birth defects linked to this type of kidney cancer include certain urinary tract problems and swelling of one side of the body, a condition called  hemihypertrophy . It is more common among some siblings and twins, which suggests a possible genetic cause. The disease occurs most often in children about 3 years old. More than 90% of cases are diagnosed before 10 years of age. In rare cases, it is seen in children older than 15 years of age, and in adults.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004316-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Wilms tumor ?</Question>
			<Answer>If your child is diagnosed with WT, do not prod or push on the child's belly area. Use care during bathing and handling to avoid injury to the tumor site. The first step in treatment is to stage the tumor. Staging helps the provider determine how far the cancer has spread and to plan for the best treatment. Surgery to remove the tumor is planned as soon as possible. Surrounding tissues and organs may also need to be removed if the tumor has spread.  Radiation therapy  and  chemotherapy  will often be started after surgery, depending on the stage of the tumor. Chemotherapy given before the surgery is also effective in preventing complications.</Answer>
