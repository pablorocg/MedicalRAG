			<Question qid="0002681-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Movement - unpredictable or jerky</Question>
			<Answer>Jerky body movement is a condition in which a person makes fast movements that they cannot control and that have no purpose. These movements interrupt the person's normal movement or posture. When abnormal movements are excessive, they are called &#8216;hyperkinetic&#8217; movements and include myoclonus (jerking and twitching) and ballismus (violent flinging of extremities), chorea (slow, twisting, or continued movements), among others.</Answer>
