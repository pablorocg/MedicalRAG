			<Question qid="0000370-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Autonomic hyperreflexia ?</Question>
			<Answer>The health care provider will do a complete nervous system and medical examination. Tell the provider about all the medicines you are taking now and that you took in the past. This helps determine which tests you need. Tests may include: Blood and urine tests,  CT  or  MRI scan ,  ECG  (measurement of the heart's electrical activity),  Lumbar puncture , Tilt-table testing (testing of blood pressure as the body position changes), Toxicology screening (tests for any drugs, including medicines, in your bloodstream), X-rays ,  Other conditions share many symptoms with AD, but have a different cause. The exam and testing help the provider rule out these other conditions, including: Carcinoid syndrome  (tumors of the small intestine, colon, appendix, and bronchial tubes in the lungs), Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a condition caused by some medicines that leads to muscle stiffness, high fever, and drowsiness),  Pheochromocytoma  (tumor of the adrenal gland),  Serotonin syndrome  (drug reaction that causes the body to have too much serotonin, a chemical produced by nerve cells),  Thyroid storm  (life-threatening condition from an overactive thyroid) , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000370-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Autonomic hyperreflexia ?</Question>
			<Answer>AD is life threatening, so it is important to quickly find and treat the problem. A person with symptoms of AD should: Sit up and raise the head, Remove tight clothing,  Proper treatment depends on the cause. If medicines or illegal drugs are causing the symptoms, those drugs must be stopped. Any illness needs to be treated. For example, the provider will check for a blocked urinary catheter and signs of constipation which may cause AD in someone with a spinal cord injury. If a slowing of the heart rate is causing AD, drugs called anticholinergics (such as atropine) may be used. Very high blood pressure needs to be treated quickly but carefully, because the blood pressure can drop suddenly. A  pacemaker  may be needed for an unstable heart rhythm.</Answer>
