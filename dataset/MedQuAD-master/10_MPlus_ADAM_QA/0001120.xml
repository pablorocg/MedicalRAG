			<Question qid="0001120-3" qtype="causes">What causes Delayed growth ?</Question>
			<Answer>Constitutional growth delay refers to children who are small for their age but are growing at a normal rate. Puberty is often late in these children. These children continue to grow after most of their peers have stopped. Most of the time, they will reach an adult height similar to their parents' height. However, other causes of growth delay must be ruled out. Genetics may also play a role. One or both parents may be short. Short but healthy parents may have a healthy child who is in the shortest 5% for their age. These children are short, but they should reach the height of one or both of their parents. Delayed or slower-than-expected growth can be caused by many different things, including: Chronic disease, Endocrine disorders, Emotional health, Infection, Poor nutrition ,  Many children with delayed growth also have delays in development.</Answer>
