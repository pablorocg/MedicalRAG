			<Answer>You are likely to have a very good outcome from breast reduction surgery. You may feel better about your appearance and be more comfortable with various activities. Pain or skin symptoms, such as striation, may disappear. You may need to wear a special supportive bra for a few months for comfort and to help with healing. Scars are permanent. They will be more visible for the first year, but will then fade. The surgeon will make every effort to place the surgical cuts so that scars are hidden. Cuts are usually made on the underside of the breast and around the areola. Most of the time, the scars should not be noticeable, even in low-cut clothing.</Answer>
