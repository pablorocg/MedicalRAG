			<Answer>Problems rarely occur after this procedure. Physical recovery usually occurs within a few days, depending on the stage of the pregnancy.  Vaginal bleeding  can last for a week to 10 days. Cramping most often lasts for a day or two. You can get pregnant before your next period, which will occur 4 to 6 weeks after the procedure. Be sure to make arrangements to prevent pregnancy, especially during the first month after the procedure. You may want to talk with your provider about  emergency contraception .</Answer>
