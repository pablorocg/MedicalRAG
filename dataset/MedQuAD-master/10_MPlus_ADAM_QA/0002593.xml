			<Question qid="0002593-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Meperidine hydrochloride overdose</Question>
			<Answer>Meperidine hydrochloride is a prescription painkiller. It is a type of drug called an opioid. Meperidine hydrochloride overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
