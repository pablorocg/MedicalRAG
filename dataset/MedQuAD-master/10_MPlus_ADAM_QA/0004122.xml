			<Question qid="0004122-2" qtype="causes">What causes Urinary tract infection - adults ?</Question>
			<Answer>Most UTIs are caused by bacteria that enter the urethra and then the bladder. The infection most commonly develops in the bladder, but can spread to the kidneys. Most of the time, your body can get rid of these bacteria. However, certain conditions increase the risk for having UTIs. Women tend to get them more often because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus than in men. Because of this, women are more likely to get an infection after sexual activity or when using a diaphragm for birth control. Menopause also increases the risk for a UTI. The following also increase your chances of developing a UTI: Diabetes , Advanced age, Conditions that affect personal care habits (such as  Alzheimer disease  and  delirium ), Problems emptying the bladder completely,  Having a urinary catheter ,  Bowel incontinence ,  Enlarged prostate ,  narrowed urethra , or anything that blocks the flow of urine,  Kidney stones , Staying still (immobile) for a long period of time (for example, while you are recovering from a hip fracture), Pregnancy, Surgery or other procedure involving the urinary tract , </Answer>
