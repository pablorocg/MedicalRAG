			<Question qid="0002270-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Kawasaki disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tests alone cannot diagnose Kawasaki disease. Most of the time, the health care provider will diagnose the disease when a child has most of the common symptoms. In some cases, a child may have a fever that lasts more than 5 days, but not all the common symptoms of the disease. These children may be diagnosed with atypical Kawasaki disease. All children with fever lasting more than 5 days should be checked for Kawasaki disease by a provider. Children with the disease need early treatment for a good outcome. The following tests may be done: Chest x-ray ,  Complete blood count ,  C-reactive protein  (CRP),  Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR ), Ferritin,  Serum albumin , Serum transaminase,  Urinalysis  - may show pus in the urine or  protein in the urine ,  Throat culture  for streptococcus,  Echocardiogram ,  Electrocardiogram ,  Tests such as ECG and echocardiography are done to look for signs of  myocarditis ,  pericarditis , and inflammation of the coronary arteries.  Arthritis  and aseptic meningitis can also occur.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002270-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Kawasaki disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Children with Kawasaki disease need hospital treatment. Treatment must be started right away to prevent damage to the coronary arteries and heart. Intravenous gamma globulin is the standard treatment. It is given in high doses as a single infusion. The child's condition often gets much better within 24 hours of treatment with IV gamma globulin. High-dose aspirin is often given along with IV gamma globulin. Even with standard treatment, up to 1 in 4 children may still develop problems in their coronary arteries. In sicker children or those with signs of heart disease, adding corticosteroids is recommended. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors such as infliximab (Remicade) or etanercept (Enbrel) are not recommended for initial treatment. However, there still needs to be better tests to tell which children will benefit from these medicines.</Answer>
