			<Question qid="0001070-2" qtype="causes">What causes Cushing syndrome due to adrenal tumor ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cushing syndrome is a disorder that occurs when your body has a higher than normal level of the hormone cortisol. This hormone is made in the  adrenal glands . Too much cortisol can be due to various problems. One such problem is a tumor on one of the adrenal glands. Adrenal tumors release cortisol. Adrenal tumors are rare. They can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Noncancerous tumors that can cause Cushing syndrome include: Adrenal adenomas, a common tumor that rarely makes excess cortisol, Macronodular  hyperplasia , which causes the adrenal glands to enlarge and make excess cortisol,  Cancerous tumors that may cause Cushing syndrome include an adrenal carcinoma. This is a rare tumor, but it usually makes excess cortisol.

			<Question qid="0001070-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Cushing syndrome due to adrenal tumor ?</Question>
			<Answer>Surgery is done to remove the adrenal tumor. Often, the entire adrenal gland is removed. Glucocorticoid replacement treatment is usually needed until the other adrenal gland recovers from surgery. You may need this treatment for 3 to 12 months. If surgery is not possible, such as in cases of adrenal cancer that has spread (metastasis), medicines can be used to stop the release of cortisol. </Answer>
