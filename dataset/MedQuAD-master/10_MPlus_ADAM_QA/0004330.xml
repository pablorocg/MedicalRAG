			<Question qid="0004330-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Wrist arthroscopy</Question>
			<Answer>Wrist arthroscopy is surgery that uses a tiny camera and surgical tools to examine or repair the tissues inside or around your wrist. The camera is called an arthroscope. The procedure allows your surgeon to detect problems and make repairs to the wrist without making larger cuts in the skin and tissue. This means that you may have less pain and recover more quickly than open surgery.</Answer>
