			<Answer>The Pap test mainly checks for changes that may turn into  cervical cancer . Cells scraped from the opening of the cervix are examined under a microscope. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. This test is sometimes called a Pap "smear" or "cervical cytology."</Answer>
