			<Question qid="0003386-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Restrictive cardiomyopathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>Restrictive cardiomyopathy refers to a set of changes in how the heart muscle functions. These changes cause the heart to fill poorly (more common) or squeeze poorly (less common). Sometimes, both problems are present. </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003386-2" qtype="causes">What causes Restrictive cardiomyopathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>In a case of restrictive cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle is of normal size or slightly enlarged. Most of the time, it also pumps normally. However, it does not relax normally during the time between heartbeats when the blood returns from the body (diastole). Although the main problem is abnormal filling of the heart, the heart may not pump blood strongly when the disease progresses. The abnormal heart function can affect the lungs, liver, and other body systems. Restrictive cardiomyopathy may affect either or both of the lower heart chambers (ventricles). Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a rare condition. The most common causes are amyloidosis and scarring of the heart from an unknown cause. It also can occur after a heart transplant. Other causes of restrictive cardiomyopathy include: Cardiac amyloidosis ,  Carcinoid heart disease , Diseases of the heart lining (endocardium), such as endomyocardial fibrosis and Loeffler syndrome (rare), Iron overload (hemochromatosis),  Sarcoidosis , Scarring after radiation or chemotherapy,  Scleroderma , Tumors of the heart , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003386-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Restrictive cardiomyopathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>Symptoms of  heart failure  are most common. These symptoms often develop slowly over time. However, symptoms sometimes start very suddenly and are severe. Common symptoms are: Cough, Breathing problems that occur at night, with activity or when lying flat , 
  Fatigue and inability to exercise, Loss of appetite, 
  Swelling of the abdomen

			<Question qid="0003386-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Restrictive cardiomyopathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>A physical exam may show: Enlarged (distended) or bulging neck veins, Enlarged liver, Lung crackles and abnormal or distant  heart sounds  in the chest heard through a stethoscope, Fluid backup into the hands and feet, Signs of  heart failure ,  Tests for restrictive cardiomyopathy include: Cardiac catheterization  and  coronary angiography ,  Chest CT scan ,  Chest x-ray ,  ECG  (electrocardiogram),  Echocardiogram  and Doppler study,  MRI of the heart , Nuclear heart scan (MUGA, RNV, PET),  Serum iron studies , Serum and  urine protein  tests ,  Restrictive cardiomyopathy may appear similar to  constrictive pericarditis . Cardiac catheterization may help confirm the diagnosis. Rarely, a  biopsy of the heart  may be required.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003386-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Restrictive cardiomyopathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>The condition causing the cardiomyopathy is treated when it can be found.  Few treatments are known to work well for restrictive cardiomyopathy. The main goal of treatment is to control symptoms and improve quality of life. The following treatments may be used to control symptoms or prevent problems: Blood thinning medicines, Chemotherapy (in some situations), Diuretics to remove fluid and help improve breathing, Medicines to prevent or control abnormal heart rhythms,  Other treatments that may be used depending on the specific type of cardiomyopathy include: Chemotherapeutic agents, Medicines such as tafamidis that target abnormal proteins (amyloid fibrils)&#160;, Liver transplantation&#160;,  Additional treatments are also under investigation. A  heart transplant  may be considered if the heart function is very poor and symptoms are severe. </Answer>

	<QAPair pid="6">
			<Question qid="0003386-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Restrictive cardiomyopathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>People with this condition often develop heart failure that gets worse. Problems with heart rhythm or "leaky" heart valves may also occur. People with restrictive cardiomyopathy may be heart transplant candidates. The outlook depends on the cause of the condition, but it is usually poor. Survival after diagnosis may exceed 10 years.</Answer>
