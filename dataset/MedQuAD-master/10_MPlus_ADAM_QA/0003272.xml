			<Question qid="0003272-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Pseudomembranous colitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pseudomembranous colitis refers to swelling or inflammation of the large intestine (colon) due to an overgrowth of  Clostridioides difficile  ( C difficile ) bacteria. This infection is a common cause of diarrhea after antibiotic use. Not all cases of diarrhea associated with antibiotic use are due to  C difficile  or will progress to pseudomembranous colitis.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003272-2" qtype="causes">What causes Pseudomembranous colitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The  C difficile  bacteria normally lives in the intestine. However, too much of these bacteria may grow when you take antibiotics. The bacteria give off a strong toxin that causes inflammation and bleeding in the lining of the colon. Any antibiotic can cause this condition. The drugs responsible for the problem most of the time are ampicillin, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins. Health care providers in the hospital may pass this bacteria from one patient to another. Pseudomembranous colitis is uncommon in children, and rare in infants. It is most often seen in people who are in the hospital. However, it is becoming more common in people who take antibiotics and are not in a hospital. Risk factors include: Older age, Antibiotic use, Use of medicines that weaken the immune system (such as chemotherapy medicines), Recent surgery, History of pseudomembranous colitis, History of  ulcerative colitis  and  Crohn disease , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003272-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Pseudomembranous colitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The antibiotic or other medicine causing the condition should be stopped. Metronidazole, vancomycin, or fidaxomicin are most often used to treat the problem, but other medicines may also be used. Electrolyte solutions  or fluids given through a vein may be needed to treat dehydration due to diarrhea. In rare cases, surgery is needed to treat infections that get worse or do not respond to antibiotics. Long term antibiotics may be needed if the  C difficile  infection returns. A treatment called fecal microbiota transplant ("stool transplant") has also been effective for infections that come back. Your provider may also suggest that you take probiotics if the infection returns. </Answer>
