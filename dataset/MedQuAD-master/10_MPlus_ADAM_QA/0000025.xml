			<Answer>Abdominal wall surgery is a procedure that improves the appearance of flabby, stretched-out abdominal (belly) muscles and skin. It is also called a tummy tuck. It can range from a simple mini-tummy tuck to more extensive surgery. Abdominal wall surgery is not the same as  liposuction , which is another way to remove fat. But, abdominal wall surgery is sometimes combined with liposuction.</Answer>
