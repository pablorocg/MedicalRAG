			<Question qid="0001966-2" qtype="causes">What causes High blood cholesterol levels ?</Question>
			<Answer>There are many types of cholesterol. The ones talked about most are: Total cholesterol -- all the cholesterols combined, High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol -- often called "good" cholesterol, Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol -- often called "bad" cholesterol ,  For many people, abnormal cholesterol levels are partly due to an  unhealthy lifestyle . This often includes  eating a diet that is high in fat . Other lifestyle factors are: Being  overweight , Lack of exercise ,  Some health conditions can also lead to abnormal cholesterol, including:  Diabetes ,  Kidney disease ,  Polycystic ovary syndrome , Pregnancy and other conditions that increase levels of female hormones,  Underactive thyroid gland ,  Medicines such as certain birth control pills, diuretics (water pills), beta-blockers, and some medicines used to treat depression may also raise cholesterol levels. Several disorders that are passed down through families lead to abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. They include:  Familial combined hyperlipidemia, Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, Familial hypercholesterolemia, Familial hypertriglyceridemia ,  Smoking does not cause higher cholesterol levels, but it can reduce your HDL (good) cholesterol.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001966-3" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose High blood cholesterol levels ?</Question>
			<Answer>A cholesterol test is done to diagnose a lipid disorder. Different experts recommend different starting ages for adults. Recommended starting ages are between 20 to 35 for men and 20 to 45 for women., Adults with normal cholesterol levels should have the test repeated every 5 years., Repeat testing sooner if changes occur in lifestyle (including weight gain and diet)., Adults with a history of elevated cholesterol, diabetes, kidney problems, heart disease, and other conditions require more frequent testing. ,  It is important to work with your health care provider to set your cholesterol goals. Newer guidelines steer health care providers away from targeting specific levels of cholesterol. Instead, they recommend different treatments or medicines and doses depending on a person's history and risk factor profile. These guidelines change from time to time as more information from research studies becomes available. General targets are: LDL: 70 to 130 mg/dL (1.81 to 3.37 mmol/L) - lower numbers are better, HDL: More than 60 mg/dL (1.55 mmol/L) or higher - higher numbers are better, Total cholesterol: Less than 200 mg/dL (5.18 mmol/L) - lower numbers are better, Triglycerides: 10 to 150 mg/dL (0.11 to 1.69 mmol/L) - lower numbers are better,  If your cholesterol results are abnormal, you may also have other tests such as:  Blood sugar (glucose) test  to look for diabetes,  Kidney function tests ,  Thyroid function tests  to look for an underactive thyroid gland , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001966-4" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for High blood cholesterol levels ?</Question>
			<Answer>Steps you can take to improve your cholesterol levels and to help prevent heart disease and a heart attack include: Quit smoking .

This will depend on: Your age, Whether or not you have heart disease, diabetes, or other blood flow problems, Whether you smoke or are overweight, Whether you have  high blood pressure  or diabetes ,  You are more likely to need  medicine to lower your cholesterol :  If you have heart disease or diabetes, If you are at high risk for heart disease (even if you do not yet have any heart problems), If your LDL cholesterol is 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L) or higher ,  Almost everyone else may get health benefits from LDL cholesterol that is lower than 160 to 190 mg/dL (4.14 mmol/L to 4.92 mmol/L). There are several types of drugs to help lower blood cholesterol levels. The drugs work in different ways. Statins are one kind of drug that lowers cholesterol and has been proven to reduce the chance of heart disease.

			<Question qid="0001966-5" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for High blood cholesterol levels ?</Question>
			<Answer>High cholesterol levels can lead to  hardening of the arteries , also called atherosclerosis. This occurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries and form hard structures called plaques. Over time, these plaques can block the arteries and cause heart disease, stroke, and other symptoms or problems throughout the body. Disorders that are passed down through families often lead to higher cholesterol levels that are harder to control. </Answer>
