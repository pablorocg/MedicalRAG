			<Question qid="0001417-2" qtype="causes">What causes Epidural abscess ?</Question>
			<Answer>Epidural abscess is a rare disorder caused by infection in the area between the bones of the skull, or spine, and the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meninges). This infection is called an intracranial epidural abscess if it is inside the skull area. It is called a spinal epidural abscess if it is found in the spine area. Most are located in the spine. The spinal infection is usually caused by bacteria but may be caused by a fungus. It can be due to other infections in the body (especially a urinary tract infection), or germs that spread through the blood. In some people, though, no other source of infection is found. An abscess inside the skull is called an intracranial epidural abscess. The cause may be any of the following: Chronic ear infections , Chronic  sinusitis , Head injury,  Mastoiditis , Recent neurosurgery ,  An abscess of the spine is called a spinal epidural abscess. It may be seen in people with any of the following: Prior back surgery or another invasive procedure involving the spine, Bloodstream infections,  Boils , especially on the back or scalp, Bone infections of the spine (vertebral osteomyelitis) ,  People who inject drugs are also at increased risk.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001417-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Epidural abscess ?</Question>
			<Answer>The goal of treatment is to cure the infection and reduce the risk for permanent damage. Treatment usually includes antibiotics and surgery. In some cases, antibiotics alone are used. Antibiotics are usually given through a vein (IV) for at least 4 to 6 weeks. Some people need to take them for a longer time, depending on the type of bacteria and how severe the disease is. Surgery may be needed to drain or remove the abscess. Surgery is also often needed to reduce pressure on the spinal cord or brain, if there is weakness or damage to the nerves.</Answer>
