			<Question qid="0004264-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Wart remover poisoning</Question>
			<Answer>Wart removers are medicines used to get rid of  warts . Warts are small growths on the skin that are caused by a virus. They are usually painless. Wart remover poisoning occurs when someone swallows or applies more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose. This article is for information only. Do NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911) or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national, toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. </Answer>
