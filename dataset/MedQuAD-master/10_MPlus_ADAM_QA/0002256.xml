			<Answer>The Jerusalem cherry is a plant that belongs to the same family as the black  nightshade . It has small, round, red and orange fruit. Jerusalem cherry poisoning occurs when someone eats pieces of this plant. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
