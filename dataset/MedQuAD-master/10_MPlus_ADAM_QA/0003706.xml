			<Question qid="0003706-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Staph infections - self-care at home ?</Question>
			<Answer>Staph (pronounced staff) is short for Staphylococcus. Staph is a type of germ (bacteria) that can cause infections almost anywhere in the body. One type of staph germ, called methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA), is harder to treat. This is because  MRSA  is not killed by certain medicines (antibiotics) used to treat other staph germs and may require different medicines from those normally used.</Answer>
