			<Question qid="0001344-2" qtype="causes">What causes Ectopic Cushing syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>
Cushing syndrome is a disorder that occurs when your body has a higher than normal level of the hormone cortisol. This hormone is made in the  adrenal glands . Too much cortisol can be due to various problems. One of the causes is if there is too much of the hormone ACTH in the blood. ACTH is usually made by the pituitary in small amounts and then signals the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. Sometimes other cells outside the pituitary can make large amounts of ACTH. This is called ectopic Cushing syndrome. Ectopic means that something is occurring in an abnormal place in the body. Ectopic Cushing syndrome is caused by  tumors  that release ACTH. Tumors that can, in rare cases, release ACTH include: Benign carcinoid tumors of the lung,  Islet cell tumors  of the pancreas,  Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid ,  Small cell tumors of the lung , Tumors of the thymus gland , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001344-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Ectopic Cushing syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.  Tests that may be done include: 24-hour urine sample to measure  cortisol  and  creatinine  levels, Blood tests to check ACTH,  cortisol , and  potassium  levels (the potassium level is often very low in ectopic Cushing syndrome),  Dexamethasone suppression test  (both high and low dose)
   , Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (a special test that measures ACTH from veins near the brain and in the chest),  Fasting glucose ,  MRI  and high resolution  CT scans  to find the tumor (sometimes nuclear medicine scans may be needed), </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001344-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Ectopic Cushing syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>The best treatment for ectopic Cushing syndrome is surgery to remove the tumor that is producing too much ACTH. Surgery is usually possible when the tumor is noncancerous ( benign ). In some cases, the tumor is cancerous and spreads to other areas of the body before your provider can discover the problem with cortisol production. Surgery may not be possible in these cases. But your provider may prescribe medicines to block cortisol production. Sometimes removal of both adrenal glands is needed if the tumor cannot be found and medicines do not fully block cortisol production.</Answer>
