			<Question qid="0001332-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Eating out</Question>
			<Answer>Eating out is a part of our busy modern lives. Even though you need to be careful to not overeat, it is possible to go out and enjoy yourself while staying healthy. Be aware that the portion sizes at many restaurants are very large. Stay away from all-you-can-eat buffets. The temptation for overeating can be hard to resist at these places. Think and plan ahead. If you know you are going out, check out the menu online so you can make healthy choices ahead of time., Avoid eating out when you are overly hungry. Eat a small healthy snack, such as carrots or a small apple, shortly before going out.,  When ordering, do not be afraid to ask to have something cooked in a healthier manner such as baked or steamed instead of fried. You can also ask to have sauces served on the side.</Answer>
