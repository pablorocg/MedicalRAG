			<Question qid="0004150-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Using a cane</Question>
			<Answer>It is important to start walking soon after surgery for a leg injury. But you will need support while your leg is healing. A cane can be used for support. It may be a good choice if you only need a little help with balance and stability, or if your leg is only a little weak or painful. The 2 main types of canes are: Canes with a single tip, Canes with 4 prongs on the bottom ,  Your surgeon or physical therapist will help you choose the type of cane that is best for you. The type of cane you use will depend on how much support you need. Talk to your health care provider or therapist if you are having a lot of pain, weakness, or balance problems. Crutches or a walker may be better options for you.</Answer>
