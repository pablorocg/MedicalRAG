			<Question qid="0004106-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Uric acid - blood</Question>
			<Answer>Uric acid is a chemical created when the body breaks down substances called purines. Purines are normally produced in the body and are also found in some foods and drinks. Foods with high content of purines include liver, anchovies, mackerel, dried beans and peas, and beer. Most uric acid dissolves in blood and travels to the kidneys. From there, it passes out in urine. If your body produces too much uric acid or does not remove enough of it, you can get sick. A high level of uric acid in the blood is called hyperuricemia. This test checks to see how much uric acid you have in your blood. Another test that can be used to check the level of  uric acid is a test of your urine .</Answer>
