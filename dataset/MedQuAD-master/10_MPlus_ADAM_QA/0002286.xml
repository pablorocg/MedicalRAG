			<Question qid="0002286-2" qtype="causes">What causes Kidney stones ?</Question>
			<Answer>Kidney stones are common. Some types run in families. They may occur at any age, including in premature infants. There are different types of kidney stones. The cause depends on the type of stone. Stones can form when urine contains too much of certain substances that form crystals. These crystals can develop into stones over weeks or months.  Calcium stones are most common. They are most likely to occur in men between ages 20 to 30. Calcium can combine with other substances to form the stone., Oxalate is the most common of these substances. Oxalate is present in certain foods such as spinach. It is also found in vitamin C supplements. Diseases of the small intestine increase your risk for these stones. ,  Calcium stones can also form from combining with phosphate or carbonate.  Other types of stones include: Cystine stones can form in people who have  cystinuria . This disorder runs in families. It affects both men and women., Struvite stones are mostly found in men or women who have repeated  urinary tract infections . These stones can grow very large and can block the kidney, ureter, or bladder., Uric acid stones are more common in men than in women. They can occur with gout or after receiving chemotherapy for some types of cancer., Other substances, such as certain medicines, also can form stones.,  The biggest risk factor for kidney stones is not drinking enough fluids. Kidney stones are more likely to occur if you make less than 1 liter (32 ounces) of urine a day. </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002286-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Kidney stones ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment depends on the type of stone and the severity of your symptoms. Kidney stones that are small most often pass through your system on their own.  Your urine should be strained so the stone can be saved and tested., Drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water per day to produce a large amount of urine. This will help the  stone pass ., Pain can be very bad. Over-the-counter pain medicines (for example, ibuprofen and naproxen), either alone or along with narcotics, can be very effective. ,  Some people with severe pain from kidney stones need to stay in the hospital. You may need to get fluids through an IV into your vein. For some types of stones, your provider may prescribe medicine to prevent stones from forming or help stones pass through your urinary system. These medicines can include: Allopurinol (for  uric acid  stones), Antibiotics (for struvite stones), Nifedipine (to relax the ureter and help the stone pass), Phosphate solutions, Sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate, Thiazide diuretics (water pills), Tamsulosin (to relax the ureter and help the stone pass),  Surgery is often needed if: The stone is too large to pass on its own., The stone is growing., The stone is blocking urine flow and causing an infection or kidney damage., The pain cannot be controlled.,  Today, most treatments are much less invasive than in the past. Lithotripsy  is used to remove stones slightly smaller than one half an inch (1.25 centimeters) that are located in the kidney or ureter. It uses sound or shock waves to break up stones into tiny fragments. Then, the stone fragments leave the body in the urine. It is also called extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy or ESWL., Procedures performed by  passing a special instrument  through a small surgical cut in your skin on your back and into your kidney or ureters are used for large stones, or when the kidneys or surrounding areas are incorrectly formed. The stone is removed with a tube (endoscope)., Ureteroscopy may be used for stones in the lower urinary tract. A laser is used to break up the stone., Rarely, open surgery (nephrolithotomy) may be needed if other methods do not work or are not possible. ,  Talk to your provider  about what treatment options may work for you. You will need to take  self-care steps.  Which steps you take depend on the type of stone you have, but they may include: Drinking extra water and other liquids, Eating more of some foods and cutting back on other foods, Taking medicines to help prevent stones, Taking medicines to help you pass a stone (anti-inflammatory drugs, alpha-blockers) , </Answer>
