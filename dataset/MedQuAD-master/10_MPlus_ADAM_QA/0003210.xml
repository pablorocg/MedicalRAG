			<Question qid="0003210-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Pressure ulcers - what to ask your doctor ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pressure ulcers are also called bedsores, or pressure sores. They can form when your skin and soft tissue press against a harder surface, such as a chair or bed for a prolonged time. This pressure reduces the blood supply to that area. Lack of blood supply can cause the skin tissue in this area to become damaged or die. When this happens, a pressure ulcer may form. Below are some questions you may want to ask your health care provider to help you or the person taking care of you to  prevent  and take care of pressure ulcers.</Answer>
