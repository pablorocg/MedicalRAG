			<Question qid="0001571-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Femur fracture repair - discharge</Question>
			<Answer>You had a fracture (break) in the femur in your leg. It is also called the thigh bone. You may have needed surgery to repair the bone. You may have had surgery called an open reduction internal fixation. In this surgery, your surgeon made a cut in the skin to align your broken bone. Your surgeon then used special metal devices to hold your bones in place while they heal. These devices are called internal fixators. The complete name of this surgery is open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). In the most common surgery to repair a femur fracture, the surgeon inserts a rod or large nail into the center of the bone. This rod helps support the bone until it heals. The surgeon may also put a plate next to your bone that is attached by screws. Sometimes, fixation devices are attached to a frame outside your leg.</Answer>
