			<Question qid="0002248-4" qtype="when to contact a medical professional">Do I need to see a doctor for Itching ?</Question>
			<Answer>Contact your provider if you have itching that:  Is severe, Does not go away, Cannot be easily explained ,  Also contact your provider if you have other, unexplained symptoms. With most itching, you do not need to see a provider. Look for an obvious cause of itching at home. It is sometimes easy for a parent to find the cause of a child's itching. Looking closely at the skin will help you identify any bites, stings, rashes, dry skin, or irritation. Have the itching checked out as soon as possible if it keeps returning and does not have a clear cause, you have itching all over your body, or you have hives that keep returning. Unexplained itching may be a symptom of a disease that could be serious.</Answer>
