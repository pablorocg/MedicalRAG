			<Question qid="0004176-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Vaginal bleeding in late pregnancy ?</Question>
			<Answer>One out of 10 women will have vaginal bleeding during their 3rd trimester. At times, it may be a sign of a more serious problem. In the last few months of pregnancy, you should always report bleeding to your health care provider right away. You should understand the difference between spotting and bleeding: Spotting is when you notice a few drops of blood every now and then on your underwear. It is not enough to cover a panty liner., Bleeding is a heavier flow of blood. With bleeding, you will need a liner or pad to keep the blood from soaking your clothes.
