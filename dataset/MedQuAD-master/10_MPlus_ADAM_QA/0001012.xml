			<Answer>CPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is a lifesaving procedure that is done when a child's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This may happen after drowning, suffocation, choking, or an injury. CPR involves: Rescue breathing, which provides oxygen to a child's lungs, Chest compressions, which keep the child's blood circulating,  Permanent brain damage or death can occur within 4 minutes if a child's blood flow stops. Therefore, you must continue CPR until the child's heartbeat and breathing return, or trained medical help arrives. For the purposes of CPR, puberty is defined as breast development in females and the presence of axillary (armpit) hair in males.</Answer>
