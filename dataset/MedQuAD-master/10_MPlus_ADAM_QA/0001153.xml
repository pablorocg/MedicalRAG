			<Question qid="0001153-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Dermatomyositis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The main treatment is the use of corticosteroid medicines. The dose of medicine is slowly tapered off as muscle strength improves. This takes about 4 to 6 weeks. You may stay on a low dose of a corticosteroid medicine after that. Medicines to suppress the immune system may be used to replace the corticosteroids. These drugs may include azathioprine, methotrexate or mycophenolate. Treatments that may be tried when disease that remains active in spite of these medicines are: Intravenous gamma globulin, Biologic drugs,  When your muscles get stronger, your provider may tell you to slowly cut back on your doses. Many people with this condition must take a medicine called prednisone for the rest of their lives. If a tumor is causing the condition, the muscle weakness and rash may get better when the tumor is removed.</Answer>
