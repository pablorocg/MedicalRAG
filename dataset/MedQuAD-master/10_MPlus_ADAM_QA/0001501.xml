			<Answer>Eye emergencies include cuts, scratches, objects in the eye, burns, chemical exposure, and blunt injuries to the eye or eyelid. Certain eye infections and other medical conditions, such as blood clots or  glaucoma , may also need medical care right away. Since the eye is easily damaged, any of these conditions can lead to vision loss if untreated.</Answer>
