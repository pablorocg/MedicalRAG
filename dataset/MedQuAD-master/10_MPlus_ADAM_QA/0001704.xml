			<Question qid="0001704-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Generalized tonic-clonic seizure ?</Question>
			<Answer>The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed check of the brain and nervous system. An  EEG (electroencephalogram)  will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. Blood and urine tests may also be ordered to check for other health problems that may be causing the seizures. Head CT  or  MRI  scan may be done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain.</Answer>
