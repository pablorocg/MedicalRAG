			<Question qid="0004252-7" qtype="considerations">What to do for VLDL test ?</Question>
			<Answer>There is no direct way of measuring VLDL. Most labs estimate your VLDL based on your triglycerides level. It is about one fifth of your triglycerides level. This estimate is not accurate if your triglycerides level is above 400 mg/dL.</Answer>
