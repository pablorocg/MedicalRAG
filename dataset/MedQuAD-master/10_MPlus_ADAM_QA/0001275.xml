			<Question qid="0001275-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Drain cleaner poisoning</Question>
			<Answer>Drain cleaners contain very dangerous chemicals that can be harmful to your health if you swallow them, breathe them in (inhale), or if they come in contact with your skin and eyes. This article discusses poisoning from swallowing or breathing in drain cleaner. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
