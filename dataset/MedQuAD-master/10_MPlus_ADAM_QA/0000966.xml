			<Question qid="0000966-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Contac overdose</Question>
			<Answer>Contac is the brand name for a cough, cold, and allergy medicine. It contains several ingredients, including members of the class of medicines known as sympathomimetics, which can have effects similar to adrenaline. Contac overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
