			<Question qid="0001215-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Diclofenac sodium overdose</Question>
			<Answer>Diclofenac sodium is a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It is used to relieve pain, swelling, and inflammation. Diclofenac sodium overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with has an  overdose , call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
