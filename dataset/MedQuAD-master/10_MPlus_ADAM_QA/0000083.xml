			<Question qid="0000083-2" qtype="causes">What causes Acute pancreatitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach. It produces the hormones insulin and glucagon. It also produces chemicals called enzymes needed to digest food. Most of the time, the enzymes are active only after they reach the small intestine.  If these enzymes become active inside the pancreas, they can digest the tissue of the pancreas. This causes swelling, bleeding, and damage to the organ and its blood vessels., This problem is called acute pancreatitis.,  Acute pancreatitis affects men more often than women. Certain diseases, surgeries, and habits make you more likely to develop this condition.  Alcohol use is responsible for up to 70% of cases in the United States. About 5 to 8 drinks per day for 5 or more years can damage the pancreas., Gallstones are the next most common cause. When the gallstones travel out of the gallbladder into the bile ducts, they block the opening that drains bile and enzymes. The bile and enzymes "back up" into the pancreas and cause swelling., Genetics may be a factor in some cases. Sometimes, the cause is not known. ,  Other conditions that have been linked to pancreatitis are: Autoimmune problems (when the immune system attacks the body), Damage to the ducts or pancreas during surgery, High blood levels of a fat called  triglycerides  -- most often above 1,000 mg/dL, Injury to the pancreas from an accident ,  Other causes include: After certain procedures used to diagnose gallbladder and pancreas problems ( endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, ERCP ) or ultrasound guided biopsy,  Cystic fibrosis ,  Overactive parathyroid gland ,  Reye syndrome , Use of certain medicines (especially estrogens, corticosteroids, sulfonamides, thiazides, and azathioprine), Certain infections, such as mumps, that involve the pancreas , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000083-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Acute pancreatitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The health care provider will do a physical exam, which may show: Abdominal tenderness or lump (mass), Fever,  Low blood pressure , Rapid heart rate, Rapid breathing (respiratory) rate ,  Lab tests that show the release of pancreatic enzymes will be done. These include: Increased blood amylase level , Increased  serum blood lipase level  (a more specific indicator of pancreatitis than amylase levels), Increased  urine amylase level ,  Other blood tests that can help diagnose pancreatitis or its complications include: Complete blood count  (CBC),  Comprehensive metabolic panel ,  The following imaging tests that can show swelling of the pancreas may be done, but are not always needed to make a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis: CT scan of the abdomen ,  MRI of the abdomen ,  Ultrasound of the abdomen , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000083-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Acute pancreatitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment often requires a stay in the hospital. It may involve: Pain medicines, Fluids given through a vein (IV), Stopping food or fluid by mouth to limit the activity of the pancreas ,  A tube may be inserted through the nose or mouth to remove the contents of the stomach. This may be done if vomiting and severe pain do not improve. The tube will stay in for 1 to 2 days to 1 to 2 weeks. Treating the condition that caused the problem can prevent repeated attacks. In some cases, therapy is needed to: Drain  fluid that has collected in or around the pancreas , Remove  gallstones , Relieve blockages of the pancreatic duct ,  In the most severe cases, surgery is needed to remove damaged, dead or infected pancreatic tissue. Avoid smoking, alcoholic drinks, and fatty foods after the attack has improved.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000083-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Acute pancreatitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Most cases go away in a week or less. However, some cases develop into a life-threatening illness. The death rate is high when: Bleeding in the pancreas  has occurred., Liver, heart, or kidney problems are also present., An abscess forms the pancreas., There is death or necrosis of larger amounts of tissue in the pancreas.,  Sometimes the swelling and infection do not fully heal. Repeat episodes of pancreatitis may also occur. Either of these can lead to  long-term damage of the pancreas .</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000083-7" qtype="complications">What are the complications of Acute pancreatitis ?</Question>
