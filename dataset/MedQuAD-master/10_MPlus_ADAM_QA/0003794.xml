			<Question qid="0003794-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Surgical wound care - open</Question>
			<Answer>An incision is a cut through the skin that is made during surgery. It is also called a surgical wound. Some incisions are small, others are long. The size of the incision depends on the kind of surgery you had. Sometimes, an incision breaks open. This may happen along the entire cut or just part of it. Your doctor may decide not to close it again with sutures (stitches).</Answer>
