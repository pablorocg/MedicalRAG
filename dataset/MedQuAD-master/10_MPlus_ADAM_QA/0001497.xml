			<Answer>Exudate is fluid that leaks out of blood vessels into nearby tissues. The fluid is made of cells, proteins, and solid materials. Exudate may ooze from cuts or from areas of infection or inflammation. It is also called pus. In people who have an eye disease called diabetic retinopathy or damage from high blood pressure, exudates form in the retina of the eye. </Answer>
