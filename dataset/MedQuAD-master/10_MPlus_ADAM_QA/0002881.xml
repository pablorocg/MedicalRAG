			<Question qid="0002881-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Osteitis fibrosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>Osteitis fibrosa is a complication of  hyperparathyroidism , a condition in which overactive parathyroid glands cause&#160;certain bones to become abnormally weak and deformed.</Answer>
	</QAPair>

			<Question qid="0002881-2" qtype="causes">What causes Osteitis fibrosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>The parathyroid glands are 4 tiny glands in the neck. These glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH helps control calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and is important for healthy bones. Too much parathyroid hormone (hyperparathyroidism) can lead to increased bone breakdown, which can cause bones to become weaker and more fragile. Many people with hyperparathyroidism eventually develop osteoporosis. Not all bones respond to PTH in the same way. Some develop abnormal areas where the bone is very soft and has almost no calcium in it. This is osteitis fibrosa. In rare cases, parathyroid cancer causes osteitis fibrosa. Osteitis fibrosa is now very rare in people who have hyperparathyroidism who have good access to medical care. It is more common in people who develop hyperparathyroidism at a young age, or who have untreated hyperparathyroidism for a long time.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002881-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Osteitis fibrosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>Osteitis fibrosa may cause bone pain or tenderness. There may be fractures (breaks) in the arms, legs, or spine, or other bone problems.  Hyperparathyroidism itself may cause any of the following: Nausea, Constipation, Fatigue, Frequent urination, Weakness, </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002881-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Osteitis fibrosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>Blood tests show a high level of calcium, parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase (a bone chemical). Phosphorus level in the blood may be low. 
X-rays may show thin bones, fractures, bowing, and  cysts .  Teeth x-rays  may also be abnormal. A  bone x-ray &#160;or bone density test may be done. People with hyperparathyroidism are more likely to have osteopenia (thin bones) or  osteoporosis  (very thin bones) than to have full-blown osteitis fibrosa.</Answer>

	<QAPair pid="5">
			<Question qid="0002881-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Osteitis fibrosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>Most of the bone problems from osteitis fibrosa can be reversed with surgery to remove the abnormal parathyroid gland(s). Some people may choose not to have surgery, and instead be followed with blood tests and bone measurements. If surgery is not possible, medicines can sometimes be used to lower the blood calcium level.</Answer>

	<QAPair pid="6">
			<Question qid="0002881-6" qtype="complications">What are the complications of Osteitis fibrosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>Complications of osteitis fibrosa include any of the following:  Bone fractures, Deformities of bone, Pain, Problems due to hyperparathyroidism, such as  kidney stones  and  kidney failure , </Answer>
	</QAPair>
	<QAPair pid="7">
			<Question qid="0002881-7" qtype="when to contact a medical professional">Do I need to see a doctor for Osteitis fibrosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>Contact your health care provider if you have bone pain, tenderness, or symptoms of hyperparathyroidism.</Answer>
	</QAPair>
	<QAPair pid="8">
			<Question qid="0002881-8" qtype="prevention">How to prevent Osteitis fibrosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>Routine blood tests done during a medical checkup or for another health problem usually detect a high calcium level before severe damage is done.</Answer>
