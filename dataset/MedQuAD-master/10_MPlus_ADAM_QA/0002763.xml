			<Question qid="0002763-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Necrotizing vasculitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Necrotizing vasculitis is a group of disorders that involve inflammation of the blood vessel walls. The size of the affected blood vessels helps to determine the names of these conditions and how the disorder causes disease.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002763-2" qtype="causes">What causes Necrotizing vasculitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Necrotizing vasculitis may be the primary condition such as in people with&#160; polyarteritis nodosa  or  granulomatosis with ANCA associated vasculitis  (formerly called Wegener granulomatosis). In other cases, the vasculitis may occur as part of another disorder, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or hepatitis C. The cause of the inflammation is unknown. It is likely related to  autoimmune  factors. The wall of the blood vessel may scar and thicken or die (become  necrotic ). The blood vessel may close, interrupting blood flow to the tissues it supplies. The lack of blood flow will cause the tissues to die. Sometimes the blood vessel may break and bleed (rupture). Necrotizing vasculitis may affect blood vessels in any part of the body. Therefore, it can cause problems in the skin, brain, lungs, intestines, kidney, brain, joints or any other organ.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002763-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Necrotizing vasculitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Fever, chills, fatigue, arthritis, or weight loss may be the only symptoms at first. However, symptoms may be in almost any part of the body. Skin: Red or purple colored bumps on the legs, hands or other parts of the body, Bluish color to the fingers and toes, Signs of tissue death due to lack of oxygen such as pain, redness, and ulcers that do not heal,  Muscles and joints: Joint pain , Leg pain, Muscle weakness,  Brain and nervous system: Pain,  numbness , tingling in an arm, leg, or other body area, Weakness of an arm, leg, or other body area, Pupils that are different sizes, Eyelid drooping, Swallowing difficulty, Speech impairment, Movement difficulty,  Lungs and respiratory tract: Cough, Shortness of breath, Sinus congestion and pain, Coughing up blood or bleeding from the nose,  Other symptoms include: Abdominal pain ,  Blood in the urine  or  stools , Hoarseness or changing voice, Chest pain from damage of the arteries that supply the heart (coronary arteries), </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002763-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Necrotizing vasculitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The health care provider will do a complete physical exam. A nervous system (neurological) exam may show signs of nerve damage. Tests that may be done include: Complete blood count, comprehensive chemistry panel, and  urinalysis ,  Chest x-ray , C-reactive protein test,  Sedimentation rate ,  Hepatitis  blood test, Blood test for antibodies against neutrophils (ANCA antibodies) or nuclear antigens (ANA), Blood test for cryoglobulins, Blood test for complement levels , Imaging studies such as angiogram, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ,  Biopsy &#160;of the skin, muscle, organ tissue, or  nerve , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002763-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Necrotizing vasculitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Corticosteroids are given in most cases. The dose will depend on how bad the condition is. Other drugs that suppress the immune system may reduce inflammation of the blood vessels. These include azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate. These medicines are often used along with corticosteroids. This combination makes it possible to control the disease with a lower dose of corticosteroids. For severe disease, cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) has been used for many years. However, rituximab (Rituxan) is equally effective and is less toxic. Recently, tocilizumab (Actemra) was shown to be effective for giant cell arteritis so the dose of corticosteroids could be reduced.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002763-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Necrotizing vasculitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Necrotizing vasculitis can be serious and life-threatening disease. The outcome depends on the location of the vasculitis and the severity of tissue damage. Complications may occur from the disease and from the medicines. Most forms of necrotizing vasculitis require long-term follow-up and treatment.</Answer>
