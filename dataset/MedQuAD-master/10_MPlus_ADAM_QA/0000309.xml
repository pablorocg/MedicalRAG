			<Question qid="0000309-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Arm MRI scan</Question>
			<Answer>An arm MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan uses strong magnets to create pictures of the upper and lower arm. This may include the elbow, wrist, hands, fingers, and the surrounding muscles and other tissues. It does not use radiation (x-rays). Single MRI images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces many images.</Answer>
