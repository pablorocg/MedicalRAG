			<Question qid="0002760-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Necrotizing enterocolitis ?</Question>

			<Question qid="0002760-2" qtype="causes">What causes Necrotizing enterocolitis ?</Question>
			<Answer>NEC occurs when the lining of the intestinal wall dies. This problem nearly always develops in an infant who is ill or premature. It is likely to occur while the infant is still in the hospital. The exact cause of this disorder is unknown. A drop in blood flow to the bowel can damage the tissue. Bacteria in the intestine may also add to the problem. Also, premature infants have an undeveloped immune response to factors such as bacteria or low blood flow. An imbalance in immune regulation appears to be involved in NEC. Babies at higher risk for the condition include: Premature infants, Infants who are fed formula rather than human milk. (Human milk contains growth factors, antibodies and immune cells which may help prevent the problem.), Infants in a nursery where an outbreak has occurred, Infants who have received blood exchange transfusions or have been seriously ill , </Answer>
