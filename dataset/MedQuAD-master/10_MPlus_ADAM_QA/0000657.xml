			<Question qid="0000657-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Cancer - renal pelvis or ureter ?</Question>
			<Answer>The goal of treatment is to eliminate the cancer. The following procedures may be used to treat the condition: Nephroureterectomy -- This involves removal of entire kidney, ureter, and the bladder cuff (tissue that connects ureter to the bladder), Nephrectomy -- Surgery to remove all or part of the kidney is often done. This may include removing part of the bladder and tissues around it, or the lymph nodes., Ureter resection -- Surgery to remove part of the ureter that contains cancer, and some healthy tissue around it. This may be used in case of superficial tumors present in lower part of the ureter near the bladder. This may help to preserve the kidney.,  Chemotherapy  -- This is used when the cancer has spread outside of the kidney or ureter. Because these tumors are similar to a form of bladder cancer, they are treated with a similar type of chemotherapy., Immunotherapy -- This is used when the cancer has spread outside of the kidney or ureter. Because these tumors are similar to a form of bladder cancer, they are treated with a similar type of immunotherapy., </Answer>
