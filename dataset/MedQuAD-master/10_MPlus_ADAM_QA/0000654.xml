			<Question qid="0000654-2" qtype="causes">What causes Canavan disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Canavan disease is passed down (inherited) through families. It is more common among the Ashkenazi Jewish population than in the general population. The lack of the enzyme aspartoacylase leads to a buildup of material called N-acetylaspartic acid in the brain. This causes the  white matter of the brain  to break down. There are two forms of the disease: Neonatal (infantile) -- This is the most common form. Symptoms are severe. Babies seem to be normal the first few months after birth. By 3 to 5 months, they have developmental problems, such as those mentioned below under the Symptoms section of this article., Juvenile -- This is a less common form. Symptoms are mild. Developmental problems are less severe than those of the neonatal form. In some cases, the symptoms are so mild that they go undiagnosed as Canavan disease., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000654-10" qtype="prevention">How to prevent Canavan disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Genetic counseling is recommended for people who want to have children and have a family history of Canavan disease. Counseling should be considered if both parents are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. For this group, DNA testing can almost always tell if the parents are carriers. A diagnosis may be made before the baby is born (prenatal diagnosis) by testing the  amniotic fluid , the fluid that surrounds the womb.</Answer>
