			<Question qid="0002532-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Marine animal stings or bites ?</Question>
			<Answer>Marine animal stings or bites refer to venomous bites or stings from any form of sea life, including jellyfish.  There are about 1200 species of animals found in the ocean that are venomous. Many can cause serious illness or death. The number of injuries caused by these animals has gone up in recent years because more people are taking part in scuba diving, snorkeling, surfing, and other water sports. These animals are most often not aggressive. Many are anchored to the ocean floor. Venomous marine animals in the United States are most often found along the California, Gulf of Mexico, and southern Atlantic coasts.</Answer>
