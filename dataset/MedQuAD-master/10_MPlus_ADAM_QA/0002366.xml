			<Question qid="0002366-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Leg MRI scan</Question>
			<Answer>A leg MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of the leg uses strong magnets to create pictures of the leg. This may include the ankle, foot, and surrounding tissues. A leg MRI also creates  pictures of the knee. MRI does not use radiation (x-rays).  Single MRI images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces many slices.</Answer>
