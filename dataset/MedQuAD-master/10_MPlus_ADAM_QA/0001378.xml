			<Question qid="0001378-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for End-stage kidney disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>ESRD may need to be treated with  dialysis  or  kidney transplant . You may need to stay on a special diet or take medicines to help your body work well. DIALYSIS Dialysis does some of the job of the kidneys when they stop working well. Dialysis can: Remove extra salt, water, and waste products so they do not build up in your body, Keep safe levels of minerals and vitamins in your body, Help control blood pressure, Help the body make red blood cells ,  Your provider will discuss dialysis with you before you need it. Dialysis removes waste from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do their job. Usually, you will go on dialysis when you have only 10% to 15% of your kidney function left., Even people who are waiting for a kidney transplant may need dialysis while waiting. ,  Two different methods are used to perform dialysis: During hemodialysis, your blood passes through a tube into an artificial kidney, or filter. This method can be done at home or at a dialysis center., During  peritoneal dialysis , a special solution passes into your belly though a catheter tube. The solution remains in your abdomen for period of time and then is removed. This method can be done at home, at work, or while traveling. ,  KIDNEY TRANSPLANT A kidney transplant is surgery to place a healthy kidney into a person with kidney failure. Your provider will refer you to a transplant center. There, you will be seen and evaluated by the transplant team. They will want to make sure that you are a good candidate for kidney transplant. SPECIAL DIET You may need to continue following a special  diet for chronic kidney disease . The diet may include: Eating foods low in protein to limit your total daily protein intake, Getting enough calories if you are losing weight, Limiting fluids, Limiting salt, potassium, phosphorous, and other electrolytes ,  OTHER TREATMENT Other treatment depends on your symptoms, but may include: Extra calcium and vitamin D. (Always talk to your provider before taking supplements.), Medicines called phosphate binders, to help prevent blood phosphorous levels from becoming too high., Treatment for anemia, such as extra iron in the diet, iron pills or shots, shots of a medicine called erythropoietin, and blood transfusions., Medicines to control your blood pressure. ,  Talk to your provider about vaccinations that you may need, including: COVID-19 vaccine,  Hepatitis A vaccine ,  Hepatitis B vaccine ,  COVID-19 vaccine ,  Flu vaccine ,  Pneumonia vaccine (PPV), </Answer>
