			<Question qid="0003022-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Periosteum</Question>
			<Answer>The periosteum is a fibrous sheath that covers bones. It contains the blood vessels and nerves that provide nourishment and sensation to the bone. The periosteum tends to be thicker in younger people. The thickness decreases when the bones are mature. The periosteum also allows bone to grow and heal after fracture.</Answer>
