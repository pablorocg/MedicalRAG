			<Question qid="0003695-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Sports cream overdose</Question>
			<Answer>Sports creams are creams or ointments used to treat aches and pains. Sports cream overdose can occur if someone uses this product on open skin (such as an open sore or wound), or swallows or gets the product in their eyes. This can be by accident or on purpose. When used on healthy skin, overdose is not likely. But a person can have an allergic reaction to the cream or ointment. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
