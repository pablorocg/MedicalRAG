			<Question qid="0001276-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Drain opener poisoning</Question>
			<Answer>Drain opening agents are chemicals used to open clogged drains, often in homes. Drain opening agent poisoning can occur if a person accidentally drinks these chemicals, or if someone splashes the poison into the eyes when pouring it or breathes in the fumes of "foaming" drain openers. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
