			<Question qid="0000808-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Choking - adult or child over 1 year</Question>
			<Answer>Choking is when someone is having a very hard time breathing because food, a toy, or other object is blocking the throat or windpipe (airway). A choking person's airway may be blocked so that not enough oxygen reaches the lungs. Without oxygen, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save a person's life.</Answer>
