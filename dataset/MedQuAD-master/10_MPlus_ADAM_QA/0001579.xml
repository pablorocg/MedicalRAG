			<Question qid="0001579-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Fever ?</Question>
			<Answer>Fever is the temporary increase in the body's temperature in response to a disease or illness. A child has a fever when the temperature is at or above one of these levels: 100.4&#176;F (38&#176;C) measured in the bottom (rectally), 99.5&#176;F (37.5&#176;C) measured in the mouth (orally), 99&#176;F (37.2&#176;C) measured under the arm (axillary),  An adult probably has a fever when the temperature is above 99&#176;F to 99.5&#176;F (37.2&#176;C to 37.5&#176;C), depending on the time of day.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001579-2" qtype="considerations">What to do for Fever ?</Question>
			<Answer>Normal body temperature may change during any given day. It is usually highest in the evening. Other factors that may affect body temperature are: A woman's menstrual cycle. In the second part of this cycle, her temperature may go up by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more., Physical activity, strong emotion, eating, heavy clothing, medicines, high room temperature, and high humidity can all increase body temperature.,  Fever is an important part of the body's defense against infection. Most bacteria and viruses that cause infections in people thrive best at 98.6&#176;F (37&#176;C). Many infants and children develop high fevers with mild viral illnesses. Although a fever signals that a battle might be going on in the body, the fever is fighting for, not against the person. Brain damage from a fever generally will not occur unless the fever is over 107.6&#176;F (42&#176;C). Untreated fevers caused by infection will seldom go over 105&#176;F (40.6&#176;C) unless the child is overdressed or in a hot place. Febrile seizures  do occur in some children. Most febrile seizures are over quickly and do not mean your child has epilepsy. These seizures also do not cause any permanent harm. Unexplained fevers that continue for days or weeks are called fevers of undetermined origin (FUO).</Answer>

Teething  may cause a slight increase in a child's temperature, but not higher than 100&#176;F (37.8&#176;C). Autoimmune or inflammatory disorders may also cause fevers. Some examples are: Arthritis  or connective tissue illnesses such as  rheumatoid arthritis  and  systemic lupus erythematosus ,  Ulcerative colitis  and  Crohn disease ,  Vasculitis  or  periarteritis nodosa ,  The first symptom of a cancer may be a fever.
