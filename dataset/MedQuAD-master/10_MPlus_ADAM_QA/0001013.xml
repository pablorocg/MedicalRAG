			<Question qid="0001013-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about CPR - infant</Question>
			<Answer>CPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is a lifesaving procedure that is done when a baby's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This may happen after drowning, suffocation, choking, or other injuries. CPR involves: Rescue breathing, which provides oxygen to the lungs., Chest compressions, which keep the blood flowing.,  Permanent brain damage or death can occur within minutes if a baby's blood flow stops. Therefore, you must continue these procedures until the infant's heartbeat and breathing return, or trained medical help arrives.</Answer>
