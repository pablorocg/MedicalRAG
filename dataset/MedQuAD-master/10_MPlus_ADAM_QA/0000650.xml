			<Question qid="0000650-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Camphor overdose</Question>
			<Answer>Camphor is a white substance with a strong odor that is commonly used in topical ointments and gels used for cough suppression and muscle aches. Camphor overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
