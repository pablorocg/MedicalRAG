			<Question qid="0003269-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Proximal renal tubular acidosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Proximal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys don't properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called  acidosis ).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003269-2" qtype="causes">What causes Proximal renal tubular acidosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>When the body performs its normal functions, it produces acid. If this acid is not removed or neutralized, the blood will become too acidic. This can lead to  electrolyte  imbalances in the blood. It can also cause problems with normal function of some cells. The kidneys help control the body's acid level by removing acid from the blood and excreting it into the urine. Acidic substances in the body are neutralized by alkaline substances, mainly bicarbonate. Proximal renal tubular acidosis (type II RTA) occurs when bicarbonate is not properly reabsorbed by the kidney's filtering system. Type II RTA is less common than type I RTA. Type I is also called  distal renal tubular acidosis . Type II most often occurs during infancy and may go away by itself. Causes of type II RTA include: Cystinosis (body is unable to break down the substance cysteine), Drugs such as ifosfamide (a chemotherapy drug), certain antibiotics that are no longer used much (tetracycline), or acetazolamide,  Fanconi syndrome , a disorder of the kidney tubes in which certain substances normally absorbed into the bloodstream by the kidneys are released into the urine instead,  Inherited fructose intolerance , a disorder in which there is a lack of the protein needed to break down the fruit sugar fructose,  Multiple myeloma , a type of blood cancer,  Primary hyperparathyroidism , a disorder in which the parathyroid glands in the neck produce too much parathyroid hormone,  Sj&#246;gren syndrome , an autoimmune disorder in which the glands that produce tears and saliva are destroyed,  Wilson disease , an inherited disorder in which there is too much copper in the body's tissues, Vitamin D deficiency, </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003269-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Proximal renal tubular acidosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Symptoms of proximal renal tubular acidosis include any of the following:  Confusion  or  decreased alertness ,  Dehydration ,  Fatigue ,  Increased breathing rate ,  Osteomalacia  (softening of the bones),  Muscle pain ,  Weakness ,  Other symptoms can include: Decreased urine output , Increased  heart rate  or  irregular heartbeat ,  Muscle cramps , Pain in the bones, back, flank, or abdomen, Skeletal deformities , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003269-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Proximal renal tubular acidosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms. Tests that may be ordered include: Arterial  blood gas ,  Blood chemistry , Blood pH level,  Urine pH  and  acid-loading test ,  Urinalysis , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003269-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Proximal renal tubular acidosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The goal is to restore normal acid level and electrolyte balance in the body. This will help correct bone disorders and reduce the risk for osteomalacia and osteopenia in adults. Some adults may need no treatment. All children need alkaline medicine such as potassium citrate and sodium bicarbonate. This is medicine that helps correct the acidic condition of the body. The medicine helps prevent bone disease caused by too much acid, such as rickets, and to allow normal growth. Thiazide diuretics are also frequently used to preserve bicarbonate in the body. The underlying cause of proximal renal tubular necrosis should be corrected if it can be found. Vitamin D  and calcium supplements may be needed to help reduce skeletal deformities resulting from osteomalacia.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003269-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Proximal renal tubular acidosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Although the underlying cause of proximal renal tubular acidosis may go away by itself, the effects and complications can be permanent or life threatening. Treatment is usually successful.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003269-7" qtype="when to contact a medical professional">Do I need to see a doctor for Proximal renal tubular acidosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Contact your provider if you have symptoms of proximal renal tubular acidosis. Get medical help right away if any of the following emergency symptoms develop: Decreased alertness or  disorientation ,  Decreased consciousness ,  Seizures , </Answer>
