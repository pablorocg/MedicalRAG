			<Question qid="0004229-2" qtype="causes">What causes Viral pneumonia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Viral  pneumonia  is more likely to occur in young children and older adults. This is because their bodies have a harder time fighting off the virus than people with a strong immune system. Viral pneumonia is most often caused by one of several viruses: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) , Influenza virus,  Parainfluenza virus , Adenovirus (less common),  Measles virus ,  Coronaviruses  such as SARS-CoV-2, which causes  COVID-19  pneumonia,  Serious viral pneumonia is more likely to happen in those with a weakened immune system, such as: Babies who are born too early., Children with heart and lung problems., People who have  HIV/AIDS ., People receiving  chemotherapy  for cancer, or other medicines that weaken the immune system., People who have had an organ transplant., Some viruses like the  flu  and SARS-CoV2 can lead to severe pneumonia in younger and otherwise healthy patients., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0004229-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Viral pneumonia ?</Question>
			<Answer>The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms. If the provider thinks you have pneumonia, you will also have a  chest x-ray . This is because the physical exam may not be able to tell pneumonia from other respiratory infections. Depending on how severe your symptoms are, other tests may be done, including: Complete blood count (CBC) ,  CT scan of the chest ,  Blood cultures  to check for viruses in the blood (or bacteria that might cause secondary infections),  Bronchoscopy  (rarely needed),  Throat and nose swab tests  to check for viruses such as the flu or SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19,  Open lung biopsy  (only done in very serious illnesses when the diagnosis cannot be made from other sources),  Sputum culture &#160;(to rule out other causes), Measuring  levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood  (arterial blood gases), </Answer>

			<Question qid="0004229-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Viral pneumonia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Antibiotics do not treat this type of lung infection. Medicines that treat viral infections may work against some pneumonias caused by influenza, coronaviruses, and herpes viruses. These medicines may be tried if the infection is caught early. Treatment may also involve: Corticosteroid medicines, Increased fluids, Oxygen, Use of humidified air,  A hospital stay may be needed if you are unable to drink enough and to help with breathing if oxygen levels are too low. People are more likely to be admitted to the hospital if they: Are 65 years old or older, Are children, Are unable to care for themselves at home, eat, or drink, Have another serious medical problem, such as a heart or kidney problem, Have been taking antibiotics at home and are not getting better, Have severe symptoms,  However, many people can be treated at home. You can take these steps at home: Control your fever with aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen or naproxen), or acetaminophen. DO NOT give aspirin to children because it may cause a dangerous illness called  Reye syndrome ., DO NOT take cough medicines without first talking to your provider. Cough medicines may make it harder for your body to cough up sputum., Drink plenty of fluids to help loosen secretions and bring up phlegm., Get a lot of rest. Have someone else do chores., </Answer>

			<Answer>Wash your hands often, after blowing your nose, going to the bathroom, diapering a baby, and before eating or preparing food. Avoid coming into contact with other sick patients. DO NOT smoke. Tobacco damages your lungs' ability to ward off infection. A medicine called palivizumab (Synagis) may be given to children under 24 months old to prevent serious RSV illness.  The  flu vaccine , is given each year to prevent pneumonia caused by the flu virus. Those who are older and those with  diabetes ,  asthma ,  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ,  cancer , or weakened immune systems should be sure to get the flu vaccine. The  COVID-19 vaccine  may help prevent severe pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is particularly important for people with weakened immune systems, chronic health conditions, and older adults.  If your immune system is weak, stay away from crowds. Ask visitors who have a cold to wear a mask and wash their hands.</Answer>
