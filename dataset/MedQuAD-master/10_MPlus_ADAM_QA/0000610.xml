			<Question qid="0000610-7" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Bunion removal ?</Question>
			<Answer>You should have less pain after your bunion is removed and your foot has healed. You should also be able to walk and wear shoes more easily. This surgery does repair some of the deformity of your foot, but it will not give you a perfect-looking foot. Full recovery may take 3 to 5 months.</Answer>
