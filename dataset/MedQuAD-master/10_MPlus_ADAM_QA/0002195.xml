			<Question qid="0002195-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Insecticide poisoning ?</Question>
			<Answer>Insecticide is any chemical that kills bugs. Insecticide poisoning occurs when someone swallows or breathes in an insecticide or it is absorbed through the skin. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002195-8" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Insecticide poisoning ?</Question>
			<Answer>How well someone does depends on how severe the poisoning is and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Swallowing these poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. It is a good sign that recovery will occur if the person continues to improve in the first 4 to 6 hours after they receive treatment. Although the symptoms are the same for carbamate and organophosphate poisoning, it is harder to recover after organophosphate poisoning.</Answer>
