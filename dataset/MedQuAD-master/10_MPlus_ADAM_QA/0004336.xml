			<Question qid="0004336-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Xeroderma pigmentosum ?</Question>

			<Question qid="0004336-2" qtype="causes">What causes Xeroderma pigmentosum ?</Question>
			<Answer>XP is an  autosomal recessive inherited disorder . This means you must have 2 copies of an abnormal gene in order for the disease or trait to develop. The disorder is inherited from both your mother and father at the same time. The abnormal gene is rare, so the chances of both parents having the gene are very rare. For this reason, it is unlikely for somebody with the condition to pass it on to the next generation, although it is possible. UV light, such as from sunlight, damages the genetic material (DNA) in skin cells. Normally, the body repairs this damage. But in people with XP, the body does not fix the damage. As a result, the skin gets very thin and patches of varying color (splotchy pigmentation) appear.</Answer>
