			<Question qid="0003359-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Refrigerant poisoning</Question>
			<Answer>A refrigerant is a chemical that makes things cold. This article discusses poisoning from sniffing or swallowing such chemicals. The most common poisoning occurs when people intentionally sniff a type of refrigerant called Freon. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
