			<Question qid="0003202-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Prenatal care in your second trimester</Question>
			<Answer>The word prenatal means before birth. Trimester means 3 months. A normal pregnancy is around 10 months and has 3 trimesters. Your health care provider may talk about your pregnancy in weeks, rather than months or trimesters. The second trimester begins at week 14 and goes through week 28.</Answer>
