			<Question qid="0001981-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Hip joint replacement ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hip replacement surgery results are very often excellent. Most or all of your pain and stiffness should go away. Some people may have problems with infection, loosening, or even dislocation of the new hip joint. Over time, the artificial hip joint can loosen. This can happen after as long as 15 to 20 years. You may need a second replacement. An infection can also occur. You should check with your surgeon periodically to ensure your hip is in good condition. Younger, more active people may wear out parts of their new hip. It may need to be replaced before the artificial hip loosens.</Answer>
