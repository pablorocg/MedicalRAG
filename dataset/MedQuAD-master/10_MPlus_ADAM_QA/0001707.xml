			<Question qid="0001707-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Genetic testing and your cancer risk</Question>
			<Answer>The genes in our cells play important roles. They affect hair and eye color and other traits passed on from parent to child. Genes also tell cells to make proteins to help the body function.  Cancer  occurs when cells begin to act abnormally. Our body has genes that prevent rapid cell growth and tumors from forming. Changes in genes (mutations) may allow cells to divide rapidly and stay active. This leads to cancer growth and tumors. Gene mutations may be the result of damage to the body or something passed down in the genes in your family. Genetic testing can help you find out if you have a genetic mutation that may lead to cancer or that may affect other members in your family. Learn about which cancers have testing available, what the results mean, and other things to consider before you get tested. </Answer>
