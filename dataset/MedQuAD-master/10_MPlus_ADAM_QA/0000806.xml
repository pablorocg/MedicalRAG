			<Question qid="0000806-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Chlorpromazine overdose ?</Question>
			<Answer>Chlorpromazine is a prescription medicine used to treat psychotic disorders. It may also be used to prevent nausea and vomiting, and for other reasons. This medicine may also change the metabolism and the effect of other medicines. Chlorpromazine overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000806-8" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Chlorpromazine overdose ?</Question>
			<Answer>Chlorpromazine is fairly safe. Most likely, an overdose will only cause drowsiness and some side effects such as uncontrolled movements of the lips, eyes, head, and neck for a short time. These movements may continue if they are not treated quickly and correctly. In rare cases, an overdose can cause more serious symptoms. Nervous system symptoms may be permanent. The most serious side effects are usually due to damage to the heart. If heart damage can be stabilized, recovery is likely. Life threatening heart rhythm disturbances may be difficult to treat, and may result in death. Survival past 2 days is usually a good sign.</Answer>
