			<Question qid="0001109-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Deciding about treatments that prolong life</Question>
			<Answer>Sometimes after injury or a long illness, the main organs of the body no longer work properly without support. Your health care provider may tell you that these organs will not repair themselves. Medical care to prolong life can keep you alive when these organs stop working well. The treatments may extend your life, but do not cure your illness. These are called life-sustaining treatments.</Answer>
