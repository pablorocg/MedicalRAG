			<Question qid="0002823-2" qtype="considerations">What to do for Nose fracture ?</Question>
			<Answer>A fractured nose is the most common  fracture  of the face. It most often occurs after an injury and often occurs with other fractures of the face. Nose injuries and neck injuries are often seen together. A blow that is forceful enough to injure the nose may be hard enough to injure the neck. Serious nose injuries cause problems that need a health care provider's attention right away. For example, damage to the cartilage can cause a collection of blood to form inside the nose. If this blood is not drained right away, it can cause an  abscess  or a permanent deformity that blocks the nose. It may lead to tissue death and cause the nose to collapse. For minor nose injuries, the provider may want to see the person within the first week after the injury to see if the nose has moved out of its normal shape. Sometimes, surgery may be needed to correct a nose or septum that has been bent out of shape by an injury.&#160;A doctor may be able to return nasal bones that have moved out of place back to their normal position within the first 2 weeks after the break.</Answer>
