			<Question qid="0003889-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Testicular torsion repair ?</Question>
			<Answer>Testicular torsion repair is surgery to untangle or untwist a spermatic cord. The spermatic cord has a collection of blood vessels in the scrotum that lead to the testicles.  Testicular torsion  develops when the cord twists. This pulling and twisting blocks blood flow to the testicle.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003889-7" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Testicular torsion repair ?</Question>
			<Answer>If surgery is done in time, you should have a complete recovery. When it is done within 4 hours after symptoms begin, the testicle can be saved most of the time. If one testicle has to be removed, the remaining healthy testicle should provide enough hormones for normal male growth, sex life, and fertility.</Answer>
