			<Question qid="0003723-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Stingray</Question>
			<Answer>A stingray is a sea animal with a whip-like tail. The tail has sharp spines that contain venom. This article describes the effects of a stingray sting. Stingrays are the most common group of fish that sting humans. Twenty-two species of stingrays are found in US coastal waters, 14 in the Atlantic and 8 in the Pacific. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual stingray sting. If you or someone you are with is stung, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
