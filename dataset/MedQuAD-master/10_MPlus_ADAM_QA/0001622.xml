			<Answer>Enlarged fontanelles are larger than expected soft spots for the age of a baby.  The skull of an infant or young child is made up of bony plates that allow for growth of the skull. The borders at which these plates intersect are called sutures or suture lines. The spaces where these connect, but are not completely joined, are called soft spots or fontanelles (fontanel or fonticulus).</Answer>
