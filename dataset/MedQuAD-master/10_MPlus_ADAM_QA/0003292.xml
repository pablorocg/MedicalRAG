			<Question qid="0003292-2" qtype="causes">What causes Pulmonary edema ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pulmonary edema is often caused by  congestive heart failure . When the heart is not able to pump efficiently, blood can back up into the veins that take blood through the lungs.  As the pressure in these blood vessels increases, fluid is pushed into the air spaces (alveoli) in the lungs. This fluid reduces normal oxygen movement through the lungs. These two factors combine to cause shortness of breath. Congestive heart failure that leads to pulmonary edema may be caused by: Heart attack, or any disease of the heart that weakens or stiffens the heart muscle ( cardiomyopathy ), Leaking or narrowed heart valves (mitral or aortic valves), Sudden, severe high blood pressure (hypertension),  Pulmonary edema may also be caused by: Certain medicines, High altitude exposure, Kidney failure, Narrowed arteries that bring blood to the kidneys, Lung damage caused by poisonous gas or severe infection, Major injury, </Answer>

			<Question qid="0003292-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Pulmonary edema ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pulmonary edema is almost always treated in the emergency room or hospital. You may need to be in an intensive care unit (ICU). Oxygen is given through a face mask or tiny plastic tubes are placed in the nose., A breathing tube may be placed into the windpipe (trachea) so you can be connected to a breathing machine (ventilator) if you cannot breathe well on your own.,  The cause of edema should be identified and treated quickly. For example, if a heart attack has caused the condition, it must be treated right away. Medicines that may be used include: Diuretics that remove excess fluid from the body, Medicines that strengthen the heart muscle, control the heartbeat, or relieve pressure on the heart, Other medicines when heart failure is not the cause of the pulmonary edema, </Answer>
