			<Answer>Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a procedure to treat  fibroids  without surgery. Uterine fibroids are noncancerous (benign) tumors that develop in the uterus (womb). During the procedure, the blood supply to the fibroids is cut off. This typically causes the fibroids to shrink.</Answer>
