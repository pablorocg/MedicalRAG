			<Question qid="0003591-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Sitz bath</Question>
			<Answer>A sitz bath is a warm water bath used for healing or cleansing purposes. You sit in the bath. The water covers only your hips and buttocks. The water may contain medicine. Sitz baths are often used to relieve pain, itching, or muscle spasms. The baths are often recommended to relieve pain and speed healing after  hemorrhoid surgery  or an  episiotomy  (surgical cut to widen the vagina opening during childbirth).</Answer>
