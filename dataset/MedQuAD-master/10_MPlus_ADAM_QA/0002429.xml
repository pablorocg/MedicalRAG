			<Question qid="0002429-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Losing weight after pregnancy ?</Question>
			<Answer>You should plan to return to your pre-pregnancy weight by 6 to 12 months after delivery. Most women lose half of their baby weight by 6 weeks after childbirth (postpartum). The rest most often comes off over the next several months.  A healthy diet with daily exercise will help you shed the pounds. Breastfeeding can also help with postpartum weight loss.</Answer>
