			<Question qid="0002602-2" qtype="causes">What causes Mesenteric venous thrombosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>MVT is a clot that blocks blood flow in a mesenteric vein. There are&#160;two such veins through which blood leaves the intestine. The condition stops the blood circulation of the intestine and can result in damage to the intestine. The exact cause of MVT is unknown. However, there are many diseases that can lead to MVT. Many of the diseases cause swelling (inflammation) of the tissues surrounding the veins, and include: Appendicitis , Cancer of the abdomen,  Diverticulitis , Liver disease with  cirrhosis , High blood pressure in the blood vessels of the liver, Abdominal surgery or trauma, Pancreatitis,  Inflammatory bowel disorders ,  Heart failure ,  Protein C or S deficiencies , Polycythemia vera, Essential thrombocythemia,  People who have disorders that make the blood more likely to stick together (clot) have a higher risk for MVT. Birth control pills and estrogen medicines also increase risk. MVT is more common in men than women. It mainly affects middle aged or older adults.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002602-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Mesenteric venous thrombosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Blood thinners are used to treat MVT when there is no associated bleeding. In some cases, medicine can be delivered directly into the clot to dissolve it. This procedure is called thrombolysis. Less often, the clot is removed with a type of surgery called thrombectomy. If there are signs and symptoms of a severe infection called  peritonitis , surgery to remove the injured part of the intestine is done. After surgery, an  ileostomy  (opening from the small intestine into a bag on the skin) or  colostomy  (an opening from the colon into the skin) may be needed.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002602-6" qtype="outlook">What is the outlook for Mesenteric venous thrombosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Outlook depends on the cause of the thrombosis and any damage to the intestine. Getting treatment for the cause before the intestine has died can result in a good recovery.</Answer>
	</QAPair>
	<QAPair pid="7">
			<Question qid="0002602-7" qtype="complications">What are the complications of Mesenteric venous thrombosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Intestinal ischemia  is a serious complication of MVT. Part or all of the intestine dies because of poor blood supply.</Answer>
