			<Question qid="0001645-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Fragile X syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition involving changes in a gene on the X chromosome. It is the most common form of inherited  intellectual disability  in boys.</Answer>
	</QAPair>
	<QAPair pid="2">
			<Question qid="0001645-2" qtype="causes">What causes Fragile X syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Fragile X syndrome is caused by a change in a gene called  FMR1 . A small part of the gene code is repeated several times in one area of the X chromosome. The more repeats (also called gene expansion), the more likely the condition will occur. The  FMR1  gene makes a protein needed for your brain to function properly. A defect in the gene makes your body produce too little of the protein, or none at all. Boys and girls can both be affected, but because boys have only one X chromosome, a single fragile X expansion is likely to affect them more severely. You can have fragile X syndrome even if your parents do not have it. A family history of fragile X syndrome, developmental problems, or intellectual disability may not be present.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001645-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Fragile X syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Behavior problems associated with fragile X syndrome include: Autism spectrum disorder, Delay in crawling, walking, or twisting, Hand flapping or hand biting, Hyperactive or impulsive behavior, 
   Intellectual disability
   ,  Speech and language delay , Tendency to avoid eye contact ,  Physical signs may include: Flat feet, Flexible joints and low muscle tone, Large body size, Large forehead or ears with a prominent jaw, Long face, Soft skin ,  Some of these problems are present at birth, while others may not develop until after puberty. Family members who have fewer repeats in the  FMR1  gene may not have intellectual disability. Women may have premature  menopause  or difficulty becoming pregnant. Both men and women may have problems with tremors and poor coordination.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001645-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Fragile X syndrome ?</Question>

   Large head circumference in babies
   , 
   Intellectual disability
   , 
   Large testicles after the start of puberty
   , 
   Subtle differences in face features

			<Question qid="0001645-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Fragile X syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>There is no specific treatment for fragile X syndrome. Instead, training and education have been developed to help affected children function at the highest possible level. Clinical trials are ongoing ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and looking at several possible medicines for treating fragile X syndrome.</Answer>
