			<Question qid="0000095-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Adrenergic bronchodilator overdose</Question>
			<Answer>Adrenergic bronchodilators are inhaled medicines that help open up the airways. They are used to treat  asthma  and chronic bronchitis. Adrenergic bronchodilator overdose occurs when someone accidentally or intentionally takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
