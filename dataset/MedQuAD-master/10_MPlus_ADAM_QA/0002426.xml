			<Question qid="0002426-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Long bones</Question>
			<Answer>Long bones are hard, dense bones that provide strength, structure, and mobility. The thigh bone (femur) is a long bone. A long bone has a shaft and two ends. Some bones in the fingers are classified as long bones, even though they are short in length. This is due to the structure and shape of the bones, not their size. Long bones contain yellow bone marrow and red bone marrow, which produce blood cells.</Answer>
