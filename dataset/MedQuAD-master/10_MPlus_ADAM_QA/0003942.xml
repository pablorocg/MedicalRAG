			<Question qid="0003942-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Time outs</Question>
			<Answer>Time out is a parenting technique to encourage children to stop doing things that you do not want them to do. When your child misbehaves, you can calmly remove your child from the activity and put them in time out. Your child usually will stop doing the behavior to avoid going into time out. Time out is mostly effective with children, 2 to 12 years old.</Answer>
