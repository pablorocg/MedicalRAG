			<Answer>Monounsaturated fat is a type of  dietary fat . It is one of the healthy fats, along with  polyunsaturated fat . Monounsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature but start to harden when chilled.  Saturated fats  and  trans fats  are solid at room temperature. These unhealthy fats can increase your risk for heart disease and other health problems. Monounsaturated fats are found in plant foods, such as nuts, avocados, and vegetable oils. Eating moderate amounts of monounsaturated (and polyunsaturated) fats in place of saturated and trans fats can benefit your health.</Answer>
