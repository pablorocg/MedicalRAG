			<Question qid="0004138-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Urine drainage bags</Question>
			<Answer>Urine drainage bags collect urine. Your bag will attach to a  catheter  (tube) that is inside your bladder. You may have a catheter and urine drainage bag because you have  urinary incontinence  (leakage), urinary retention (not being able to urinate), surgery that made a catheter necessary, or another health problem.</Answer>
