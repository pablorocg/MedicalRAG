			<Question qid="0001537-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Facts about trans fats</Question>
			<Answer>Trans fat is a type of  dietary fat . Of all the fats, trans fat is the worst for your health. Too much trans fat in your diet increases your risk for heart disease and other health problems. Trans fats are made when liquid oils are turned into solid fats, like shortening or margarine. These are called partially-hydrogenated oils (PHOs). Because of the health risks from these fats, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned food manufacturers from adding PHOs to foods. Although the food industry has greatly reduced the use of trans fat in recent years, this type of fat may still be found in many fried, packaged, or processed foods, including: Anything fried and battered, Shortening and stick margarine, Commercially baked cakes, pies, and cookies, Refrigerated dough,  Animal foods, such as red meats and dairy, have small amounts of trans fats, which is not cause for concern in its natural form. Most trans fats are artificially made and come from processed foods.</Answer>
