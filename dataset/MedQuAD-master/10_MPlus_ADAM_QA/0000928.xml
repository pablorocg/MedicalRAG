			<Question qid="0000928-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Complement</Question>
			<Answer>Complement is a blood test that measures the activity of certain proteins in the liquid portion of your blood. The complement system is a group of nearly 60 proteins that are in blood plasma or on the surface of some cells. The proteins work with your immune system and play a role to protect the body from infections, and to remove dead cells and foreign material. Rarely, people may inherit deficiency of some complement proteins. These people are prone to certain infections or autoimmune disorders. There are nine major complement proteins. They are labeled C1 through C9. This article describes the test that measures total complement activity.</Answer>
