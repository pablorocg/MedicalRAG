			<Question qid="0002642-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Millipede toxin</Question>
			<Answer>Millipedes are worm-like bugs. Certain types of millipedes release a harmful substance (toxin) all over their body if they are threatened or if you handle them roughly. Unlike centipedes, millipedes do not bite or sting. The toxin that millipedes release keeps away most predators. Some large millipede species can spray these toxins as far as 32 inches (80 centimeters). Contact with these secretions may cause allergic reactions in some people. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual toxin exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
