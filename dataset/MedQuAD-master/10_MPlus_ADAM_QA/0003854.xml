			<Answer>This article describes the effects of a tarantula spider bite or contact with tarantula hairs. The class of insects contains the largest number of venomous species known. This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage a tarantula spider bite. If you or someone you are with is bitten, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.</Answer>
