			<Question qid="0002068-2" qtype="considerations">What to do for Hyperactivity ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hyperactive behavior usually refers to constant activity, being easily distracted, impulsiveness, inability to concentrate, aggressiveness, and similar behaviors. Typical behaviors may include: Fidgeting or constant moving, Wandering, Talking too much, Difficulty participating in quiet activities (such as reading) ,  Hyperactivity is not easily defined. It often depends on the observer. Behavior that seems excessive to&#160;one person may not seem excessive to another. But certain children, when compared to others, are clearly far more active. This can become a problem if it interferes with school work or making friends. Hyperactivity is often considered more of a problem for schools and parents than it is for the child. But many hyperactive children are unhappy, or even depressed. Hyperactive behavior may make a child a target for bullying, or make it harder to connect with other children. Schoolwork may be more difficult. Kids who are hyperactive are frequently punished for their behavior. Excessive movement (hyperkinetic&#160;behavior) often decreases as the child grows older. It may disappear entirely by adolescence.</Answer>
