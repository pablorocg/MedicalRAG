			<Question qid="0002237-2" qtype="causes">What causes Iron deficiency anemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Red blood cells bring oxygen to the body's tissues. Red blood cells are made in your bone marrow. Red blood cells circulate through your body for 3 to 4 months. Parts of your body, such as your spleen, remove old blood cells. Iron is a key part of red blood cells. Without iron to make hemoglobin, your blood cannot carry oxygen effectively. Your body normally gets iron through your diet. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells. Iron deficiency anemia develops when your body's iron stores run low. This can occur because: You lose more blood cells and iron than your body can replace, Your body does not absorb iron well, Your body is able to absorb iron, but you are not eating enough foods that contain iron, Your body needs more iron than normal (such as if you are pregnant or breastfeeding) ,  Bleeding can cause iron loss. Common causes of bleeding are: Heavy, long, or frequent menstrual periods, Cancer in the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, or  colon ,  Esophageal varices , often from cirrhosis, The use of aspirin, ibuprofen, or  arthritis  medicines for a long time, which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding,  Peptic ulcer disease ,  Your body may not absorb enough iron in your diet due to: Celiac disease ,  Crohn disease ,  Gastric bypass surgery , Taking too many antacids or too much of the antibiotic tetracycline ,  You may not get enough iron in your diet if: You are a strict vegetarian, You do not eat enough foods that contain iron , </Answer>

			<Question qid="0002237-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Iron deficiency anemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Treatment may include  taking iron supplements  and eating  iron-rich foods . Iron supplements (most often ferrous sulfate) build up the iron stores in your body. Most of the time, your provider will measure your iron level before you start supplements. If you cannot take iron by mouth, you may need to take it through a vein ( intravenous ) or by an injection into the muscle. Pregnant and breastfeeding women will need to take extra iron because they often cannot get enough iron from their normal diet. Often your anemia will improve or resolve with 6 weeks of iron therapy. You will need to keep taking iron for another 6 months to replace your body's iron stores in your bone marrow. Iron supplements are mostly well tolerated, but may cause: Nausea, Vomiting, Constipation ,  Iron-rich foods include: Chicken and turkey, Dried lentils, peas, and beans, Fish, Meats (liver is the highest source), Soybeans, baked beans, chickpeas, Whole-grain bread ,  Other sources include: Oatmeal, Raisins, prunes, apricots, and peanuts, Spinach, kale, and other greens ,  Vitamin C helps your body to absorb iron.
