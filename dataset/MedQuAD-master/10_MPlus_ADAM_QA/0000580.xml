			<Question qid="0000580-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Breech birth ?</Question>
			<Answer>The best position for your baby inside your uterus at the time of delivery is head down. This position makes it easier and safer for your baby to pass through the birth canal. In the last weeks of pregnancy, your health care provider will check to see what position your baby is in. If your baby's position does not feel normal, you may need an ultrasound. If the ultrasound shows your baby is breech, your provider will talk with you about your options for a safe delivery. </Answer>
