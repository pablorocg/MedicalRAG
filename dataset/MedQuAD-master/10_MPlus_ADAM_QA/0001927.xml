			<Question qid="0001927-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Hemothorax ?</Question>
			<Answer>The goal of treatment is to get the person stable, stop the bleeding, and remove the blood and air in the pleural space. A chest tube is inserted through the chest wall between the ribs to drain the blood and air., It is left in place and attached to suction for several days to re-expand the lung. ,  If a chest tube alone does not control the bleeding, surgery ( thoracotomy ) may be needed to stop the bleeding. The cause of the hemothorax will be also treated. The underlying lung may have collapsed. This can lead to breathing difficulty. In people who have had an injury, chest tube drainage may be all that is needed. Surgery may not be necessary. WHAT TO EXPECT AT THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including oxygen saturation, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as needed. The person may receive: Breathing support -- This may include oxygen, non-invasive airway pressure support such as BIPAP, or endotracheal intubation (placement of a breathing tube through the mouth or nose into the airway) and placement on a ventilator (life support breathing machine), Blood tests and possible blood transfusion, Chest tube (tube through the skin and muscles between the ribs into the space around the lungs) if there is lung collapse, CT scan, Analysis of the pleural fluid, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Fluids given through the vein (IV), Medicines to treat symptoms, X-rays of chest and abdomen or other parts of the body if there are additional injuries, </Answer>
