			<Question qid="0000516-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Bone tumor ?</Question>
			<Answer>Some benign bone tumors go away on their own and do not need treatment. Your provider will closely monitor you. You will likely need regular imaging tests, such as x-rays, to see if the tumor shrinks or grows.  Surgery may be needed to remove the tumor in some cases. Treatment for cancerous bone tumors that have spread from other parts of the body depends on where the cancer started. Radiation therapy may be given to prevent fractures or to relieve pain. Chemotherapy may be used to prevent fractures or the need for surgery or radiation. Tumors that start in the bone are rare. After biopsy, a combination of chemotherapy and surgery is usually necessary. Radiation therapy may be needed before or after surgery.</Answer>
