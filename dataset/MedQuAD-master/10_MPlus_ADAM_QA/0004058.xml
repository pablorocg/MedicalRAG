			<Question qid="0004058-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Turbinate surgery</Question>
			<Answer>The inside walls of the nose have 3 pairs of long thin bones covered with a layer of tissue that can expand. These bones are called nasal turbinates. Allergies  or other nasal problems can cause the turbinates to swell and block airflow. Surgery can be done to open blocked airways and improve your breathing.</Answer>
