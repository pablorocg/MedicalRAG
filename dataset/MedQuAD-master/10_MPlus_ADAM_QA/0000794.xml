			<Answer>Chiropractic care is a way to treat health problems that affect the nerves, muscles, bones, and joints of the body. A health care provider who provides chiropractic care is called a chiropractor. Hands-on adjustment of the spine, called spinal manipulation, is the basis of chiropractic care. Most chiropractors also use other types of treatments as well.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000794-3" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Chiropractic care for back pain ?</Question>
			<Answer>More than one session is most often needed to correct a problem. Treatments generally last several weeks. Your chiropractor may suggest 2 or 3 short sessions a week at first. These would last only about 10 to 20 minutes each. Once you start improving, your treatments may be just once a week. You and your chiropractor will talk about how effective the treatment is based on the goals you discussed in your first session.</Answer>
