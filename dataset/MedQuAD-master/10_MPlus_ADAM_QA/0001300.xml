			<Question qid="0001300-2" qtype="causes">What causes Dubin-Johnson syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>DJS is a very rare genetic disorder. In order to inherit the condition, a child must get a copy of the defective gene from both parents. The syndrome interferes with the body's ability to move bilirubin through the liver into the bile. When the liver and spleen break down worn out red blood cells, bilirubin is produced. Bilirubin normally moves into the bile, which is produced by the liver. It then flows into the bile ducts, is stored in the gallbladder, and then flows into the digestive system. When bilirubin is not properly transported into the bile, it builds up in the bloodstream. This causes the skin and the whites of the eyes to turn yellow. This is called jaundice. Severely high levels of bilirubin can damage the brain and other organs. People with DJS have lifelong mild jaundice that may be made worse by: Alcohol, Birth control pills, Environmental factors that affect the liver, Infection, Pregnancy, Fasting or dehydration, Fatigue, </Answer>
