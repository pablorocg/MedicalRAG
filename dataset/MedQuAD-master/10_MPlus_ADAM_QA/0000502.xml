			<Question qid="0000502-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Body temperature norms</Question>
			<Answer>Normal body temperature varies by person, age, activity, and time of day. The average normal body temperature is generally accepted as 98.6&#176;F (37&#176;C). Some studies have shown that the "normal" body temperature can have a wide range, from 97&#176;F (36.1&#176;C) to 99&#176;F (37.2&#176;C). A temperature over 100.4&#176;F (38&#176;C) most often means you have a fever caused by an infection or illness. Body temperature normally changes throughout the day and in adults, it is lowest in the early morning.</Answer>
