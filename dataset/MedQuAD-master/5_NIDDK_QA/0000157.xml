			<Question qid="0000157-5" qtype="information">What is (are) Kidney Failure: Eat Right to Feel Right on Hemodialysis ?</Question>
			<Answer>You already know you need to watch how much you drink. Any food that is liquid at room temperature also contains water. These foods include soup, Jell-O, and ice cream. Many fruits and vegetables contain lots of water, too. They include melons, grapes, apples, oranges, tomatoes, lettuce, and celery. All these foods add to your fluid intake.
                
Fluid can build up between dialysis sessions, causing swelling and weight gain. The extra fluid affects your blood pressure and can make your heart work harder. You could have serious heart trouble from overloading your system with fluid.
                
Control Your Thirst   The best way to reduce fluid intake is to reduce thirst caused by the salt you eat. Avoid salty foods like chips and pretzels. Choose low-sodium products.   You can keep your fluids down by drinking from smaller cups or glasses. Freeze juice in an ice cube tray and eat it like a popsicle. (Remember to count the popsicle in your fluid allowance!) The dietitian will be able to give you other tips for managing your thirst.
                
Your dry weight is your weight after a dialysis session when all of the extra fluid in your body has been removed. If you let too much fluid build up between sessions, it is harder to get down to your proper dry weight. Your dry weight may change over a period of 3 to 6 weeks. Talk with your doctor regularly about what your dry weight should be.
                
My dry weight should be _____________.
                
Talk With a Dietitian   Even though you are on hemodialysis, your kidneys may still be able to remove some fluid. Or your kidneys may not remove any fluid at all. That is why every patient has a different daily allowance for fluid. Talk with your dietitian about how much fluid you can have each day.   I can have _____ ounces of fluid each day.   Plan 1 day of fluid servings:   I can have _____ ounce(s) of ______________ with breakfast.   I can have _____ ounce(s) of ______________ in the morning.   I can have _____ ounce(s) of ______________ with lunch.   I can have _____ ounce(s) of ______________ in the afternoon.   I can have _____ ounce(s) of ______________ with supper.   I can have _____ ounce(s) of ______________ in the evening.   TOTAL _______ ounces (should equal the allowance written above)</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000157-7" qtype="information">What is (are) Kidney Failure: Eat Right to Feel Right on Hemodialysis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Potassium is a mineral found in many foods, especially milk, fruits, and vegetables. It affects how steadily your heart beats. Healthy kidneys keep the right amount of potassium in the blood to keep the heart beating at a steady pace. Potassium levels can rise between dialysis sessions and affect your heartbeat. Eating too much potassium can be very dangerous to your heart. It may even cause death.
                
To control potassium levels in your blood, avoid foods like avocados, bananas, kiwis, and dried fruit, which are very high in potassium. Also, eat smaller portions of other high-potassium foods. For example, eat half a pear instead of a whole pear. Eat only very small portions of oranges and melons.
                
Dicing and Boiling Potatoes to Reduce Potassium   You can remove some of the potassium from potatoes by dicing or shredding them and then boiling them in water. Your dietitian will give you more specific information about the potassium content of foods.
                

                

                
Talk With a Dietitian   Make a food plan that reduces the potassium in your diet. Start by noting the high-potassium foods (below) that you now eat. A dietitian can help you add other foods to the list.           High-Potassium Foods               apricots avocados bananas beets Brussels sprouts cantaloupe clams dates figs     kiwi fruit lima beans melons milk nectarines orange juice oranges peanuts pears (fresh)     potatoes prune juice prunes raisins sardines spinach tomatoes winter squash yogurt         Others:______________________________________   Changes:   Talk with a dietitian about foods you can eat instead of high-potassium foods.

			<Answer>Phosphorus is a mineral found in many foods. If you have too much phosphorus in your blood, it pulls calcium from your bones. Losing calcium will make your bones weak and likely to break. Also, too much phosphorus may make your skin itch. Foods like milk and cheese, dried beans, peas, colas, nuts, and peanut butter are high in phosphorus. Usually, people on dialysis are limited to 1/2 cup of milk per day. The renal dietitian will give you more specific information regarding phosphorus.
                
You probably will need to take a phosphate binder like Renagel, PhosLo, Tums, or calcium carbonate to control the phosphorus in your blood between dialysis sessions. These medications act like sponges to soak up, or bind, phosphorus while it is in the stomach. Because it is bound, the phosphorus does not get into the blood. Instead, it is passed out of the body in the stool.</Answer>

			<Answer>Before you were on dialysis, your doctor may have told you to follow a low-protein diet. Being on dialysis changes this. Most people on dialysis are encouraged to eat as much high-quality protein as they can. Protein helps you keep muscle and repair tissue. The better nourished you are, the healthier you will be. You will also have greater resistance to infection and recover from surgery more quickly.
                
Your body breaks protein down into a waste product called urea. If urea builds up in your blood, it&apos;s a sign you have become very sick. Eating mostly high-quality proteins is important because they produce less waste than others. High-quality proteins come from meat, fish, poultry, and eggs (especially egg whites).
                

                
Talk With a Dietitian   Meat, fish, and chicken are good sources of protein. Talk with a dietitian about the meats you eat.   I will eat ______ servings of meat each day. A regular serving size is 3 ounces. This is about the size of the palm of your hand or a deck of cards.   Try to choose lean (low-fat) meats that are also low in phosphorus. If you are a vegetarian, ask about other ways to get your protein.   Low-fat milk is a good source of protein. But milk is high in phosphorus and potassium. And milk adds to your fluid intake. Talk with a dietitian to see if milk fits into your food plan.   I (will) (will not) drink milk. I will drink ______ cup(s) of milk a day.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000157-13" qtype="information">What is (are) Kidney Failure: Eat Right to Feel Right on Hemodialysis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Sodium is found in salt and other foods. Most canned foods and frozen dinners contain large amounts of sodium. Too much sodium makes you thirsty. But if you drink more fluid, your heart has to work harder to pump the fluid through your body. Over time, this can cause high blood pressure and congestive heart failure.
                
Try to eat fresh foods that are naturally low in sodium Look for products labeled low sodium.
                
Do not use salt substitutes because they contain potassium. Talk with a dietitian about spices you can use to flavor your food. The dietitian can help you find spice blends without sodium or potassium.

			<Answer>Calories provide energy for your body. If your doctor recommends it, you may need to cut down on the calories you eat. A dietitian can help you plan ways to cut calories in the best possible way.
                
Some people on dialysis need to gain weight. You may need to find ways to add calories to your diet. Vegetable oils-like olive oil, canola oil, and safflower oil-are good sources of calories. Use them generously on breads, rice, and noodles.
                
Butter and margarines are rich in calories. But these fatty foods can also clog your arteries. Use them less often. Soft margarine that comes in a tub is better than stick margarine. Vegetable oils are the healthiest way to add fat to your diet if you need to gain weight.
                
Hard candy, sugar, honey, jam, and jelly provide calories and energy without clogging arteries or adding other things that your body does not need. If you have diabetes, be very careful about eating sweets. A dietitian&apos;s guidance is very important for people with diabetes.</Answer>
