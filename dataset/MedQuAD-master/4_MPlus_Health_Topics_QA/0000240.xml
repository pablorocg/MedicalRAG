			<Question qid="0000240-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Cosmetic Dentistry</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : If you have stained, broken or uneven teeth, cosmetic dentistry can help. Cosmetic dentistry is different from orthodontic treatment, which can straighten your teeth with braces or other devices.    Cosmetic dental procedures include       - Bleaching to make teeth whiter    - Repairing chips or rough spots with fillings that match your teeth     - Filling cavities with tooth-colored materials     - Reshaping teeth that don&apos;t match the others    - Closing gaps between teeth     - Covering broken teeth with porcelain crowns</Answer>
