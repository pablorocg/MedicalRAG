			<Question qid="0000181-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Child Nutrition</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : A healthy diet helps children grow and learn. It also helps prevent obesity and weight-related diseases, such as diabetes. To give your child a nutritious diet       - Make half of what is on your child&apos;s plate fruits and vegetables    - Choose healthy sources of protein, such as lean meat, nuts, and eggs    - Serve whole-grain breads and cereals because they are high in fiber. Reduce refined grains.    - Broil, grill, or steam foods instead of frying them    - Limit fast food and junk food    - Offer water or milk instead of sugary fruit drinks and sodas       Learn about your children&apos;s nutrient requirements. Some of them, such as the requirements for iron and calcium, change as your child ages.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</Answer>
