			<Answer>Summary : Molds are fungi that can be found both outdoors and indoors. They grow best in warm, damp and humid conditions.

Inhaling or touching mold or mold spores may cause allergic reactions or asthma attacks in sensitive people. Molds can cause fungal infections. In addition, mold exposure may irritate your eyes, skin, nose, throat, and lungs.     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</Answer>
