			<Answer>Measles is an infectious disease caused by a virus. It spreads easily from person to person. It causes a blotchy red rash. The rash often starts on the head and moves down the body. Other symptoms include       - Fever    - Cough    - Runny nose    - Conjunctivitis (pink eye)    - Feeling achy and run down    - Tiny white spots inside the mouth       Sometimes measles can lead to serious problems. There is no treatment for measles, but the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine can prevent it.    &quot;German measles&quot;, also known as rubella, is a completely different illness.
