			<Question qid="0000047-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Antioxidants</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Antioxidants are man-made or natural substances that may prevent or delay some types of cell damage. Antioxidants are found in many foods, including fruits and vegetables. They are also available as dietary supplements. Examples of antioxidants include       -  Beta-carotene     -  Lutein     -  Lycopene    -  Selenium    -  Vitamin A    -  Vitamin C    -  Vitamin E       Vegetables and fruits are rich sources of antioxidants. There is good evidence that eating a diet with lots of vegetables and fruits is healthy and lowers risks of certain diseases. But it isn&apos;t clear whether this is because of the antioxidants, something else in the foods, or other factors.    High-dose supplements of antioxidants may be linked to health risks in some cases. For example, high doses of beta-carotene may increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers. High doses of vitamin E may increase risks of prostate cancer and one type of stroke. Antioxidant supplements may also interact with some medicines. To minimize risk, tell you of your health care providers about any antioxidants you use.    NIH: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</Answer>
