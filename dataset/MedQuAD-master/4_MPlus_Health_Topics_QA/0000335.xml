			<Question qid="0000335-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Ergonomics</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Ergonomics looks at what kind of work you do, what tools you use and your whole job environment. The aim is to find the best fit between you and your job conditions. Examples of ergonomic changes to your work might include       -  Adjusting the position of your computer keyboard to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome     -  Being sure that the height of your desk chair allows your feet to rest flat on floor    -  Learning the right way to lift heavy objects to prevent back injuries     -  Using handle coatings or special gloves to suppress vibrations from power tools       No matter what the job is, the goal is to make sure that you are safe, comfortable, and less prone to work-related injuries.</Answer>
