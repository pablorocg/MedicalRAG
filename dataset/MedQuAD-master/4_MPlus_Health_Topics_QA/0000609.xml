			<Answer>Summary : Methamphetamine - meth for short - is a very addictive stimulant drug. It is a powder that can be made into a pill or a shiny rock (called a crystal). The powder can be eaten or snorted up the nose. It can also be mixed with liquid and injected into your body with a needle. Crystal meth is smoked in a small glass pipe.    Meth at first causes a rush of good feelings, but then users feel edgy, overly excited, angry, or afraid. Meth use can quickly lead to addiction. It causes medical problems including       - Making your body temperature so high that you pass out    - Severe itching    - &quot;Meth mouth&quot; - broken teeth and dry mouth    - Thinking and emotional problems       NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse</Answer>
