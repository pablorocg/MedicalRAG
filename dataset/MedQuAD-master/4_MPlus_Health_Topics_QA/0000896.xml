			<Answer>Summary : Mastering new skills such as how to walk, talk, and use the potty are developmental milestones. It is exciting to watch your toddler learn new skills. The normal development of children aged 1-3 can be broken down into the following areas:       - Gross motor - walking, running, climbing    - Fine motor - feeding themselves, drawing    - Sensory - seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, and smelling    - Language - saying single words, then sentences    - Social - playing with others, taking turns, doing fantasy play       Toddlers do not develop at the same rate. There is a wide range of what is considered &quot;normal.&quot; Your child may be ahead in some areas and slightly behind in others. If you are worried about possible delays, talk to your child&apos;s health care provider.</Answer>
