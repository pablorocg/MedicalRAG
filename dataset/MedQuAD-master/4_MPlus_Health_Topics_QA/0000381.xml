			<Answer>Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited developmental disability. A problem with a specific gene causes the disease. Normally, the gene makes a protein you need for brain development. But the problem causes a person to make little or none of the protein. This causes the symptoms of Fragile X.     People with only a small change in the gene might not show any signs of Fragile X. People with bigger changes can have severe symptoms. These might include       - Intelligence problems, ranging from learning disabilities to severe intellectual disabilities    - Social and emotional problems, such as aggression in boys or shyness in girls    - Speech and language problems, especially in boys       A genetic blood test can diagnose Fragile X. There is no cure. You can treat some symptoms with educational, behavioral, or physical therapy, and with medicines. Getting treatment early can help.
