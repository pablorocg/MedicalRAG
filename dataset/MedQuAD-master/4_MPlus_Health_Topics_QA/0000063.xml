			<Question qid="0000063-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Assisted Reproductive Technology</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is used to treat infertility. It includes fertility treatments that handle both a woman&apos;s egg and a man&apos;s sperm. It works by removing eggs from a woman&apos;s body. The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the woman&apos;s body. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most common and effective type of ART.     ART procedures sometimes use donor eggs, donor sperm, or previously frozen embryos. It may also involve a surrogate or gestational carrier. A surrogate is a woman who becomes pregnant with sperm from the male partner of the couple. A gestational carrier becomes pregnant with an egg from the female partner and the sperm from the male partner.     The most common complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. It can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are put into the woman&apos;s body.</Answer>
