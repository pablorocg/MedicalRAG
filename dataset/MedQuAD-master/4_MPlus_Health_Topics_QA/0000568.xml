			<Answer>Summary : A lung transplant removes a person&apos;s diseased lung and replaces it with a healthy one. The healthy lung comes from a donor who has died. Some people get one lung during a transplant. Other people get two.    Lung transplants are used for people who are likely to die from lung disease within 1 to 2 years. Their conditions are so severe that other treatments, such as medicines or breathing devices, no longer work. Lung transplants most often are used to treat people who have severe       - COPD     - Cystic fibrosis    - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis    - Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency    - Pulmonary hypertension        Complications of lung transplantation include rejection of the transplanted lung and infection.
