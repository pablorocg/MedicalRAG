			<Question qid="0000279-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Diabetic Nerve Problems ?</Question>
			<Answer>If you have diabetes, your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Over time, this can damage the covering on your nerves or the blood vessels that bring oxygen to your nerves. Damaged nerves may stop sending messages, or may send messages slowly or at the wrong times.     This damage is called diabetic neuropathy. Over half of people with diabetes get it. Symptoms may include       - Numbness in your hands, legs, or feet    - Shooting pains, burning, or tingling    - Nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea    - Problems with sexual function    - Urinary problems    - Dizziness when you change positions quickly       Your doctor will diagnose diabetic neuropathy with a physical exam and nerve tests. Controlling your blood sugar can help prevent nerve problems, or keep them from getting worse. Treatment may include pain relief and other medicines.
