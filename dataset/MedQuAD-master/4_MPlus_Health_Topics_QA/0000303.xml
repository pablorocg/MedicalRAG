			<Question qid="0000303-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Drugs and Young People</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Drug abuse is a serious public health problem. It affects almost every community and family in some way. Drug abuse in children and teenagers may pose a greater hazard than in older people. This is because their brains are not yet fully developed. As a result, the brains of young people may be more susceptible to drug abuse and addiction than adult brains.    Abused drugs include       - Amphetamines     - Anabolic steroids     - Club drugs    - Cocaine     - Heroin     - Inhalants    - Marijuana    - Prescription drugs       There are different types of treatment for drug abuse. But it is better to prevent drug abuse in the first place.    NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse</Answer>
