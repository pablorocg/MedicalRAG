			<Question qid="0000153-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Caregivers</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Caregivers provide help to another person in need. The person receiving care may be an adult - often a parent or a spouse - or a child with special medical needs. Some caregivers are family members. Others are paid. They do many things:       - Shop for food and cook    - Clean the house    - Pay bills    - Give medicine    - Help the person go to the toilet, bathe and dress    - Help the person eat    - Provide company and emotional support       Caregiving is hard, and caregivers of chronically ill people often feel stress. They are &quot;on call&quot; 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If you&apos;re caring for someone with mental problems like Alzheimer&apos;s disease  it can be especially difficult. Support groups can help.    Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women&apos;s Health</Answer>
