			<Question qid="0000338-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Evaluating Health Information</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Millions of consumers get health information from magazines, TV or the Internet. Some of the information is reliable and up to date; some is not. How can you tell the good from the bad?    First, consider the source. If you use the Web, look for an &quot;about us&quot; page. Check to see who runs the site: Is it a branch of the government, a university, a health organization, a hospital or a business? Focus on quality. Does the site have an editorial board? Is the information reviewed before it is posted? Be skeptical. Things that sound too good to be true often are. You want current, unbiased information based on research.
