			<Answer>Summary : Tubal ligation (getting your &quot;tubes tied&quot;) is a type of surgery. It prevents a woman from getting pregnant. It is a permanent form of birth control.    The surgery closes the fallopian tubes, which connect the ovaries to the uterus. It usually takes about 30 minutes. Almost all women go home the same day. Women can return to most normal activities within a few days.    Tubal ligation can sometimes be reversed, but not always.</Answer>
