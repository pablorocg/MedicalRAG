			<Question qid="0000340-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Exercise for Children</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Like adults, kids need exercise. Most children need at least an hour of physical activity every day. Regular exercise helps children       - Feel less stressed     - Feel better about themselves    - Feel more ready to learn in school     - Keep a healthy weight     - Build and keep healthy bones, muscles and joints     - Sleep better at night       As kids spend more time watching TV, they spend less time running and playing. Parents should limit TV, video game and computer time. Parents can set a good example by being active themselves. Exercising together can be fun for everyone. Competitive sports can help kids stay fit. Walking or biking to school, dancing, bowling and yoga are some other ways for kids to get exercise.</Answer>
