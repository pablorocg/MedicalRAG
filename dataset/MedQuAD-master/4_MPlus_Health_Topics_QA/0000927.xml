			<Question qid="0000927-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Understanding Medical Research</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : It seems to happen almost every day - you hear about the results of a new medical research study. Sometimes the results of one study seem to disagree with the results of another study.    It&apos;s important to be critical when reading or listening to reports of new medical findings. Some questions that can help you evaluate health information include:       - Was the study in animals or people?     - Does the study include people like you?     - How big was the study?    - Was it a randomized controlled clinical trial?    - Where was the research done?     - If a new treatment was being tested, were there side effects?     - Who paid for the research?    - Who is reporting the results?        NIH: National Institutes of Health</Answer>
