They are       - Vitamin A    - B vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12 and folate)    - Vitamin C    - Vitamin D    - Vitamin E    - Vitamin K       You can usually get all your vitamins from the foods you eat. Your body can also make vitamins D and K. People who eat a vegetarian diet may need to take a vitamin B12 supplement.     Each vitamin has specific jobs. If you have low levels of certain vitamins, you may get health problems. For example, if you don&apos;t get enough vitamin C, you could become anemic. Some vitamins may help prevent medical problems. Vitamin A prevents night blindness.    The best way to get enough vitamins is to eat a balanced diet with a variety of foods. In some cases, you may need to take vitamin supplements.
