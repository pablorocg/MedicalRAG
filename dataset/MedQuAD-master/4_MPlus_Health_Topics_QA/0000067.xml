			<Answer>Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare, inherited disease. It affects the nervous system, immune system, and other body systems. Symptoms appear in young children, usually before age 5. They include       - Ataxia - trouble coordinating movements    - Poor balance     - Slurred speech    - Tiny, red spider veins, called telangiectasias, on the skin and eyes    - Lung infections    - Delayed physical and sexual development       People with A-T have an increased risk of developing diabetes and cancers, especially lymphoma and leukemia. Although it affects the brain, people with A-T usually have normal or high intelligence.    A-T has no cure. Treatments might improve some symptoms. They include injections to strengthen the immune system, physical and speech therapy, and high-dose vitamins.     NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</Answer>
