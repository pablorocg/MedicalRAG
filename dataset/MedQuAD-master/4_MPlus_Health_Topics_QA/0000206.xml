			<Question qid="0000206-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Climate Change</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Climate is the average weather in a place over a period of time. Climate change is major change in temperature, rainfall, snow, or wind patterns lasting for many years. It can be caused by natural factors or by human activities. Today climate changes are occurring at an increasingly rapid rate.    Climate change can affect our health. It can lead to       - More heat-related illness and deaths    - More pollen, mold, and air pollution. This can cause an increase in allergies, asthma, and breathing problems.    - Mosquitoes and other insects that carry diseases spreading to areas that used to be too cold for them.    - More floods and rising sea levels. This can cause an increase in contamination of food and water.    - More extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and wildfires. These can cause death, injuries, stress, and mental health problems.       Researchers are studying the best ways to lessen climate change and reduce its impact on our health.
