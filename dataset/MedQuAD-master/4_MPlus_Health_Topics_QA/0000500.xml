			<Question qid="0000500-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Immune System and Disorders ?</Question>
			<Answer>Your immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend against germs. It helps your body to recognize these &quot;foreign&quot; invaders. Then its job is to keep them out, or if it can&apos;t, to find and destroy them.    If your immune system cannot do its job, the results can be serious. Disorders of the immune system include       - Allergy and asthma - immune responses to substances that are usually not harmful    - Immune deficiency diseases - disorders in which the immune system is missing one or more of its parts    - Autoimmune diseases - diseases causing your immune system to attack your own body&apos;s cells and tissues by mistake       NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</Answer>
