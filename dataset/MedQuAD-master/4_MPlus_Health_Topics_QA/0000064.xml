			<Answer>Summary : If you have a disability or injury, you may use a number of assistive devices. These are tools, products or types of equipment that help you perform tasks and activities. They may help you move around, see, communicate, eat, or get dressed. Some are high-tech tools, such as computers. Others are much simpler, like a &quot;reacher&quot; - a tool that helps you grab an object you can&apos;t reach.</Answer>
