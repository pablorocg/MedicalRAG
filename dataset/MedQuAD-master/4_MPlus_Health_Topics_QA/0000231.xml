			<Question qid="0000231-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Constipation ?</Question>
			<Answer>Constipation means that a person has three or fewer bowel movements in a week. The stool can be hard and dry. Sometimes it is painful to pass. At one time or another, almost everyone gets constipated. In most cases, it lasts a short time and is not serious.     There are many things you can do to prevent constipation. They include       -  Eating more fruits, vegetables and grains, which are high in fiber    -  Drinking plenty of water and other liquids    -  Getting enough exercise    -  Taking time to have a bowel movement when you need to    -  Using laxatives only if your doctor says you should    -  Asking your doctor if medicines you take may cause constipation           It&apos;s not important that you have a bowel movement every day. If your bowel habits change, however, check with your doctor.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</Answer>
