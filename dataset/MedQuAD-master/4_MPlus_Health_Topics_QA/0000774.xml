			<Question qid="0000774-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Respiratory Failure ?</Question>
			<Answer>Respiratory failure happens when not enough oxygen passes from your lungs into your blood. Your body&apos;s organs, such as your heart and brain, need oxygen-rich blood to work well. Respiratory failure also can happen if your lungs can&apos;t remove carbon dioxide (a waste gas) from your blood. Too much carbon dioxide in your blood can harm your body&apos;s organs.    Diseases and conditions that affect your breathing can cause respiratory failure. Examples include       - Lung diseases such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and cystic fibrosis    - Conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing, such as spinal cord injuries, muscular dystrophy and stroke    - Damage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs. An injury to the chest can cause this damage.    - Drug or alcohol overdose    - Injuries from inhaling smoke or harmful fumes       Treatment for respiratory failure depends on whether the condition is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) and how severe it is. It also depends on the underlying cause. You may receive oxygen therapy and other treatment to help you breathe.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</Answer>
