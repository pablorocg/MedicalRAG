			<Question qid="0000212-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Cochlear Implants</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : A cochlear implant is a small, complex electronic device that can help to provide a sense of sound. People who are profoundly deaf or severely hard-of-hearing can get help from them. The implant consists of two parts. One part sits on the outside of the body, behind the ear. A second part is surgically placed under the skin.      An implant does not restore normal hearing. It can help a person understand speech. Children and adults can benefit from them.
