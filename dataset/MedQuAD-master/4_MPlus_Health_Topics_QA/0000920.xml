			<Question qid="0000920-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Tumors and Pregnancy ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tumors during pregnancy are rare, but they can happen. Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren&apos;t cancer. Malignant ones are. The most common cancers in pregnancy are breast cancer, cervical cancer, lymphoma, and melanoma. Cancer itself rarely harms the baby, and some cancer treatments are safe during pregnancy. You and your health care provider will work together to find the best treatment. Your options will depend on how far along the pregnancy is, as well as the type, size, and stage of your cancer.    Another type of tumor that women can get is called a gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). It happens when a fertilized egg doesn&apos;t become a fetus. GTD is not always easy to find. It is usually benign, but some types can be malignant. The most common type of GTD is a molar pregnancy. In its early stages, it may look like a normal pregnancy. You should see your health care provider if you have vaginal bleeding (not menstrual bleeding).     Treatment depends on the type of tumor, whether it has spread to other places, and your overall health.</Answer>
