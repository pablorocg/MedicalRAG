			<Answer>A collapsed lung happens when air enters the pleural space, the area between the lung and the chest wall. If it is a total collapse, it is called pneumothorax. If only part of the lung is affected, it is called atelectasis.    Causes of a collapsed lung include       - Lung diseases such as pneumonia or lung cancer    - Being on a breathing machine    - Surgery on the chest or abdomen    - A blocked airway       If only a small area of the lung is affected, you may not have symptoms. If a large area is affected, you may feel short of breath and have a rapid heart rate.    A chest x-ray can tell if you have it. Treatment depends on the underlying cause.
