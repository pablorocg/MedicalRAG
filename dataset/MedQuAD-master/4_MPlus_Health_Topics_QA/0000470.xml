			<Answer>Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin disease. It can occur in one or multiple areas of your body. HS usually develops in your armpits, groin, and anal area. It causes long-term skin inflammation and can be painful.     Symptoms include        - Blackheads and red, tender bumps, called abscesses. The abscesses get bigger, break open, and leak pus    - Tunnels that form under the skin between abscesses    - Scarring       No one knows what causes HS. It is more common in women, African Americans, and people who have had acne. It usually starts after the teenage years.
