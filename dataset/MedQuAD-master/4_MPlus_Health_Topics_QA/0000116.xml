			<Question qid="0000116-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Bone Infections ?</Question>
			<Answer>Like other parts of the body, bones can get infected. The infections are usually bacterial, but can also be fungal. They may spread to the bone from nearby skin or muscles, or from another part of the body through the bloodstream. People who are at risk for bone infections include those with diabetes, poor circulation, or recent injury to the bone. You may also be at risk if you are having hemodialysis.     Symptoms of bone infections include       - Pain in the infected area    - Chills and fever    - Swelling, warmth, and redness       A blood test or imaging test such as an x-ray can tell if you have a bone infection. Treatment includes antibiotics and often surgery.</Answer>
