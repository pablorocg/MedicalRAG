			<Answer>Legionnaires&apos; disease is a type of pneumonia caused by bacteria. You usually get it by breathing in mist from water that contains the bacteria. The mist may come from hot tubs, showers, or air-conditioning units for large buildings. The bacteria don&apos;t spread from person to person.    Symptoms of Legionnaires&apos; disease include high fever, chills, a cough, and sometimes muscle aches and headaches. Other types of pneumonia have similar symptoms. You will probably need a chest x-ray to diagnose the pneumonia. Lab tests can detect the specific bacteria that cause Legionnaires&apos; disease.     Most people exposed to the bacteria do not become sick. You are more likely to get sick if you       - Are older than 50    - Smoke    - Have a chronic lung disease    - Have a weak immune system       Legionnaires&apos; disease is serious and can be life-threatening. However, most people recover with antibiotic treatment.     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</Answer>
