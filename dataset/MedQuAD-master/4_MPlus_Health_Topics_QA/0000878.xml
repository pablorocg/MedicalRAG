			<Question qid="0000878-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Teenage Pregnancy ?</Question>
			<Answer>Most teenage girls don&apos;t plan to get pregnant, but many do. Teen pregnancies carry extra health risks to both the mother and the baby. Often, teens don&apos;t get prenatal care soon enough, which can lead to problems later on. They have a higher risk for pregnancy-related high blood pressure and its complications. Risks for the baby include premature birth and a low birth weight.    If you&apos;re a pregnant teen, you can help yourself and your baby by       - Getting regular prenatal care    - Taking your prenatal vitamins for your health and to prevent some birth defects    - Avoiding smoking, alcohol, and drugs    - Using a condom, if you are having sex, to prevent sexually transmitted diseases that could hurt your baby</Answer>
