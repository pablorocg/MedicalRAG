			<Question qid="0000192-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Chlamydia Infections ?</Question>
			<Answer>Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted disease caused by bacteria. You can get chlamydia during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with an infected partner. Both men and women can get it.    Chlamydia usually doesn&apos;t cause symptoms. If it does, you might notice a burning feeling when you urinate or abnormal discharge from your vagina or penis.    In both men and women, chlamydia can infect the urinary tract. In women, infection of the reproductive system can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause infertility or serious problems with pregnancy. Babies born to infected mothers can get eye infections and pneumonia from chlamydia. In men, chlamydia can infect the epididymis, the tube that carries sperm. This can cause pain, fever, and, rarely, infertility.    A lab test can tell if you have chlamydia. Antibiotics will cure the infection. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading chlamydia. Experts recommend that sexually active women 25 and younger get a chlamydia test every year.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</Answer>
