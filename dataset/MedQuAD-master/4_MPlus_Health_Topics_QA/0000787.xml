			<Answer>Rubella is an infection caused by a virus. It is usually mild with fever and a rash. About half of the people who get rubella do not have symptoms. If you do get them, symptoms may include       - A rash that starts on the face and spreads to the body    - Mild fever    - Aching joints, especially in young women    - Swollen glands       Rubella is most dangerous for a pregnant woman&apos;s baby. It can cause miscarriage or birth defects.    Rubella spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes. People without symptoms can still spread it. There is no treatment, but the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine can prevent it.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</Answer>
