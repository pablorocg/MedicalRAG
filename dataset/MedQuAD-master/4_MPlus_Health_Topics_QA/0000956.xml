			<Question qid="0000956-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Vitamin K</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Vitamins are substances that your body needs to grow and develop normally. Vitamin K helps your body by making proteins for healthy bones and tissues. It also makes proteins for blood clotting. If you don&apos;t have enough vitamin K, you may bleed too much.    Newborns have very little vitamin K. They usually get a shot of vitamin K soon after they are born.    If you take blood thinners, you need to be careful about how much vitamin K you get. You also need to be careful about taking vitamin E supplements. Vitamin E can interfere with how vitamin K works in your body. Ask your health care provider for recommendations about these vitamins.    There are different types of vitamin K. Most people get vitamin K from plants such as green vegetables, and dark berries. Bacteria in your intestines also produce small amounts of another type of vitamin K.</Answer>
