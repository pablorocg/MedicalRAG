			<Question qid="0000479-1" qtype="information">What is (are) HIV/AIDS and Pregnancy ?</Question>
			<Answer>If you have HIV/AIDS and find out you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, you should let your health care provider know as soon as possible. Some HIV/AIDS medicines may harm your baby. Your health care provider may want you to take different medicines or change the doses.      It is also possible to give HIV to your baby. This is most likely to happen around the time you give birth. For this reason, treatment during this time is very important for protecting your baby from infection. Several treatments may prevent the virus from spreading from you to your baby. Your health care provider can recommend the best one for you.     Your baby will also need to have treatment for at least the first six weeks of life. Regular testing will be needed to find out if your baby is infected.</Answer>
