			<Answer>Summary : So you&apos;re going to have a baby! Whether you are pregnant or are planning to get pregnant, you will want to give your baby a healthy start.    You need to have regular visits with your healthcare provider. These prenatal care visits are very important for your baby and yourself. Some things you might do when you are pregnant could hurt your baby, such as smoking or drinking. Some medicines can also be a problem, even ones that a doctor prescribed. You will need to drink plenty of fluids and eat a healthy diet. You may also be tired and need more rest.    Your body will change as your baby grows during the nine months of your pregnancy. Don&apos;t hesitate to call your health care provider if you think you have a problem or something is bothering or worrying you.</Answer>
