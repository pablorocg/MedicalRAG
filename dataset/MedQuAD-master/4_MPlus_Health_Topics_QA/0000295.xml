			<Question qid="0000295-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Dizziness and Vertigo ?</Question>
			<Answer>When you&apos;re dizzy, you may feel lightheaded or lose your balance. If you feel that the room is spinning, you have vertigo.    A sudden drop in blood pressure or being dehydrated can make you dizzy. Many people feel lightheaded if they get up too quickly from sitting or lying down.    Dizziness usually gets better by itself or is easily treated. However, it can be a symptom of other disorders. Medicines may cause dizziness, or problems with your ear. Motion sickness can also make you dizzy. There are many other causes.    If you are dizzy often, you should see your health care provider to find the cause.</Answer>
