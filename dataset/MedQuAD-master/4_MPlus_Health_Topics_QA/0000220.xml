			<Question qid="0000220-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Color Blindness ?</Question>
			<Answer>Most of us see our world in color. We enjoy looking at a lush green lawn or a red rose in full bloom. If you have a color vision defect, you may see these colors differently than most people.     There are three main kinds of color vision defects. Red-green color vision defects are the most common. This type occurs in men more than in women. The other major types are blue-yellow color vision defects and a complete absence of color vision.    Most of the time, color blindness is genetic. There is no treatment, but most people adjust and the condition doesn&apos;t limit their activities.</Answer>
