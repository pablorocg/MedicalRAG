			<Answer>Lactose intolerance means that you cannot digest foods with lactose in them. Lactose is the sugar found in milk and foods made with milk. After eating foods with lactose in them, you may feel sick to your stomach. You may also have       -  Gas     -  Diarrhea     -  Swelling in your stomach        Your doctor may do a blood, breath or stool test to find out if your problems are due to lactose intolerance.    Lactose intolerance is not serious. Eating less food with lactose, or using pills or drops to help you digest lactose usually helps. You may need to take a calcium supplement if you don&apos;t get enough of it from your diet, since milk and foods made with milk are the most common source of calcium for most people.
