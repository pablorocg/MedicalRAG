			<Question qid="0000251-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about CT Scans</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Computed tomography (CT) is a type of imaging. It uses special x-ray equipment to make cross-sectional pictures of your body.     Doctors use CT scans to look for       -  Broken bones    -  Cancers    -  Blood clots    -  Signs of heart disease    -  Internal bleeding       During a CT scan, you lie still on a table. The table slowly passes through the center of a large X-ray machine. The test is painless. During some tests you receive a contrast dye, which makes parts of your body show up better in the image.
