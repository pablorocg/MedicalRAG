			<Question qid="0000499-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Hysterectomy</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : A hysterectomy is surgery to remove a woman&apos;s uterus or womb. The uterus is the place where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant. After a hysterectomy, you no longer have menstrual periods and can&apos;t become pregnant. Sometimes the surgery also removes the ovaries and fallopian tubes. If you have both ovaries taken out, you will enter menopause.    Your health care provider might recommend a hysterectomy if you have       - Fibroids     - Endometriosis that hasn&apos;t been cured by medicine or surgery    - Uterine prolapse - when the uterus drops into the vagina     - Cancer of the uterine, cervix, or ovaries    - Vaginal bleeding that persists despite treatment     - Chronic pelvic pain, as a last resort        Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women&apos;s Health</Answer>
