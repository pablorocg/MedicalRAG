			<Question qid="0000189-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Children's Health</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Your child&apos;s health includes physical, mental and social well-being. Most parents know the basics of keeping children healthy, like offering them healthy foods, making sure they get enough sleep and exercise and insuring their safety.     It is also important for children to get regular checkups with their health care provider. These visits are a chance to check your child&apos;s development. They are also a good time to catch or prevent problems.    Other than checkups, school-age children should be seen for       - Significant weight gain or loss    - Sleep problems or change in behavior    - Fever higher than 102    - Rashes or skin infections    - Frequent sore throats    - Breathing problems</Answer>
