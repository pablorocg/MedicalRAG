			<Answer>Many disorders can affect our ability to speak and communicate. They range from saying sounds incorrectly to being completely unable to speak or understand speech. Causes include       - Hearing disorders and deafness    - Voice problems, such as dysphonia or those caused by cleft lip or palate     - Speech problems like stuttering    - Developmental disabilities    - Learning disorders    - Autism spectrum disorder    - Brain injury    - Stroke       Some speech and communication problems may be genetic. Often, no one knows the causes. By first grade, about 5 percent of children have noticeable speech disorders. Speech and language therapy can help.
