			<Question qid="0000827-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Smokeless Tobacco</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Many people who chew tobacco or dip snuff think it&apos;s safer than smoking. But you don&apos;t have to smoke tobacco for it to be dangerous. Chewing or dipping carries risks like       -  Cancer of the mouth    -  Decay of exposed tooth roots    - Pulling away of the gums from the teeth    -  White patches or red sores in the mouth that can turn to cancer       Recent research shows the dangers of smokeless tobacco may go beyond the mouth. It might also play a role in other cancers, heart disease and stroke.     Smokeless tobacco contains more nicotine than cigarettes. Nicotine is a highly addictive drug that makes it hard to stop using tobacco once you start. Having a quit date and a quitting plan can help you stop successfully.
