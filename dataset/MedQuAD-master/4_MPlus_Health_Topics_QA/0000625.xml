			<Question qid="0000625-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about MRSA</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It causes a staph infection (pronounced &quot;staff infection&quot;) that is resistant to several common antibiotics. There are two types of infection. Hospital-associated MRSA happens to people in healthcare settings. Community-associated MRSA happens to people who have close skin-to-skin contact with others, such as athletes involved in football and wrestling.    Infection control is key to stopping MRSA in hospitals. To prevent community-associated MRSA       - Practice good hygiene    - Keep cuts and scrapes clean and covered with a bandage until healed    - Avoid contact with other people&apos;s wounds or bandages    - Avoid sharing personal items, such as towels, washcloths, razors, or clothes    - Wash soiled sheets, towels, and clothes in hot water with bleach and dry in a hot dryer       If a wound appears to be infected, see a health care provider. Treatments may include draining the infection and antibiotics.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</Answer>
