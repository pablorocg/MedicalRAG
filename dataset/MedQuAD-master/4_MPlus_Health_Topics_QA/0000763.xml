			<Question qid="0000763-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Radiation Emergencies</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Radiation is a type of energy. People are exposed to small amounts of radiation every day from sources such as sunlight. A radiation emergency would involve larger amounts of radiation and could be caused by       -  Dirty bombs - a mix of explosives with radioactive powder    - Fallout from a nuclear bomb    -  Accidental release from a nuclear reactor or a nuclear weapons plant       A lot of radiation over a short period can cause burns or radiation sickness. If the exposure is large enough, it can cause premature aging or even death.    Although there are no guarantees of safety during a radiation emergency, you can take actions to protect yourself. You should have a disaster plan. Being prepared can help reduce fear, anxiety and losses. If you do experience a disaster, it is normal to feel stressed. You may need help in finding ways to cope.
