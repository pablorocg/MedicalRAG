			<Question qid="0000676-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Oxygen Therapy ?</Question>
			<Answer>Oxygen therapy is a treatment that provides you with extra oxygen. Oxygen is a gas that your body needs to function. Normally, your lungs absorb oxygen from the air you breathe. But some conditions can prevent you from getting enough oxygen.    You may need oxygen if you have       - COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)    - Pneumonia    - A severe asthma attack    - Late-stage heart failure    - Cystic fibrosis    - Sleep apnea       The oxygen comes through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube. If you have a chronic problem, you may have a portable oxygen tank or a machine in your home.    A different kind of oxygen therapy is called hyperbaric oxygen therapy. It uses oxygen at high pressure to treat wounds and serious infections.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</Answer>
