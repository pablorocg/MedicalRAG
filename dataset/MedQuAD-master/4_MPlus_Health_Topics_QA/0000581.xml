			<Question qid="0000581-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Managed Care ?</Question>
			<Answer>Managed care plans are a type of health insurance. They have contracts with health care providers and medical facilities to provide care for members at reduced costs. These providers make up the plan&apos;s network. How much of your care the plan will pay for depends on the network&apos;s rules.    Plans that restrict your choices usually cost you less. If you want a flexible plan, it will probably cost more. There are three types of managed care plans:       - Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) usually only pay for care within the network. You choose a primary care doctor who coordinates most of your care.    - Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO) usually pay more if you get care within the network. They still pay part of the cost if you go outside the network.    - Point of Service (POS) plans let you choose between an HMO or a PPO each time you need care.</Answer>
