			<Question qid="0000183-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Child Sexual Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>Sexual abuse is one form of child abuse. It includes a wide range of actions between a child and an adult or older child. Often these involve body contact, but not always. Exposing one&apos;s genitals to children or pressuring them for sex is sexual abuse. Using a child for pornography is also sexual abuse.    Most sexual abusers know the child they abuse. They may be family friends, neighbors or babysitters. About one-third of abusers are related to the child. Most abusers are men. If you think a child may have been abused, it&apos;s important to report it.</Answer>
