			<Question qid="0000320-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Elder Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>Many older people are victims of elder abuse. It is the mistreatment of an older person, usually by a caregiver. It can happen within the family. It can also happen in assisted living facilities or nursing homes.    The mistreatment may be       - Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse    - Neglect or abandonment    - Financial abuse - stealing of money or belongings       Possible signs of elder abuse include unexplained bruises, burns, and injuries. There may also be bed sores and poor hygiene. The person may become withdrawn, agitated, and depressed. There may be a sudden change in the person&apos;s financial situation.    Elder abuse will not stop on its own. Someone else needs to step in and help. If you think that an older person is in urgent danger, call 9-1-1. Otherwise, contact adult protective services.
