			<Question qid="0000104-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Blood Clots</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Normally, if you get hurt, your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding. Some people get too many clots or their blood clots abnormally. Many conditions can cause the blood to clot too much or prevent blood clots from dissolving properly.    Risk factors for excessive blood clotting include       - Certain genetic disorders    - Atherosclerosis    - Diabetes    - Atrial fibrillation    - Overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome    - Some medicines    - Smoking    Blood clots can form in, or travel to, the blood vessels in the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and limbs. A clot in the veins deep in the limbs is called   deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT usually affects the deep veins of the legs. If a blood clot in a deep vein breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs and blocks blood flow, the condition is called   pulmonary embolism. Other complications of blood clots include   stroke,   heart attack, kidney problems and kidney failure, and pregnancy-related problems. Treatments for blood clots include   blood thinners and other medicines.</Answer>
