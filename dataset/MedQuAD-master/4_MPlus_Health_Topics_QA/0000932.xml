			<Question qid="0000932-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Urinary Tract Infections ?</Question>
			<Answer>The urinary system is the body&apos;s drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. It includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common type of infection in the body.    You may have a UTI if you notice       - Pain or burning when you urinate    - Fever, tiredness, or shakiness    - An urge to urinate often    - Pressure in your lower belly     - Urine that smells bad or looks cloudy or reddish    - Pain in your back or side below the ribs       People of any age or sex can get UTIs. But about four times as many women get UTIs as men. You&apos;re also at higher risk if you have diabetes, need a tube to drain your bladder, or have a spinal cord injury.    If you think you have a UTI it is important to see your doctor. Your doctor can tell if you have a UTI with a urine test. Treatment is with antibiotics.
