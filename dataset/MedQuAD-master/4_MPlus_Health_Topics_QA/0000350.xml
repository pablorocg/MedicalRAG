			<Question qid="0000350-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Fainting ?</Question>
			<Answer>Fainting is a temporary loss of consciousness. If you&apos;re about to faint, you&apos;ll feel dizzy, lightheaded, or nauseous. Your field of vision may &quot;white out&quot; or &quot;black out.&quot; Your skin may be cold and clammy. You lose muscle control at the same time, and may fall down.    Fainting usually happens when your blood pressure drops suddenly, causing a decrease in blood flow to your brain. It is more common in older people. Some causes of fainting include       - Heat or dehydration     - Emotional distress     - Standing up too quickly     - Certain medicines     - Drop in blood sugar     - Heart problems        When someone faints, make sure that the airway is clear and check for breathing. The person should stay lying down for 10-15 minutes. Most people recover completely. Fainting is usually nothing to worry about, but it can sometimes be a sign of a serious problem. If you faint, it&apos;s important to see your health care provider and find out why it happened.</Answer>
