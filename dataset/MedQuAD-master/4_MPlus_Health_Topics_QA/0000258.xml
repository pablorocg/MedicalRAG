			<Question qid="0000258-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Dehydration ?</Question>
			<Answer>When you&apos;re dehydrated, your body doesn&apos;t have enough fluid to work properly. An average person on an average day needs about 3 quarts of water. But if you&apos;re out in the hot sun, you&apos;ll need a lot more than that. Most healthy bodies are very good at regulating water. Elderly people, young children and some special cases - like people taking certain medications - need to be a little more careful.    Signs of dehydration in adults include       - Being thirsty    - Urinating less often than usual    - Dark-colored urine    - Dry skin    - Feeling tired    - Dizziness and fainting       Signs of dehydration in babies and young children include a dry mouth and tongue, crying without tears, no wet diapers for 3 hours or more, a high fever and being unusually sleepy or drowsy.    If you think you&apos;re dehydrated, drink small amounts of water over a period of time. Taking too much all at once can overload your stomach and make you throw up. For people exercising in the heat and losing a lot of minerals in sweat, sports drinks can be helpful. Avoid any drinks that have caffeine.</Answer>
