			<Question qid="0000489-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Household Products</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : The products you use for cleaning, carpentry, auto repair, gardening, and many other household uses can contain ingredients that can harm you, your family, and the environment. These include        - Oven and drain cleaners    - Laundry powder    - Floor polish    - Paint thinners, strippers and removers    - Pesticides    - Grease and rust removers    - Motor oil and fuel additives    - Arts and craft supplies       Toxic substances in these products can cause harm if inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through the skin. People respond to toxic substances in different ways. At high doses a toxic substance might cause birth defects or other serious problems, including brain damage or death.    To avoid problems, keep products in the containers they come in and use them exactly as the label says. Follow label directions or get medical help if you swallow, inhale or get them on your skin.     Environmental Protection Agency</Answer>
