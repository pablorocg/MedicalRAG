			<Question qid="0000750-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Prostate Cancer ?</Question>
			<Answer>The prostate is the gland below a man&apos;s bladder that produces fluid for semen. Prostate cancer is common among older men. It is rare in men younger than 40. Risk factors for developing prostate cancer include being over 65 years of age, family history, and being African-American.    Symptoms of prostate cancer may include       - Problems passing urine, such as pain, difficulty starting or stopping the stream, or dribbling    - Low back pain    - Pain with ejaculation       To diagnose prostate cancer, you doctor may do a digital rectal exam to feel the prostate for lumps or anything unusual. You may also get a blood test for prostate-specific antigen (PSA). These tests are also used in prostate cancer screening, which looks for cancer before you have symptoms. If your results are abnormal, you may need more tests, such as an ultrasound, MRI, or biopsy.    Treatment often depends on the stage of the cancer. How fast the cancer grows and how different it is from surrounding tissue helps determine the stage. Men with prostate cancer have many treatment options. The treatment that&apos;s best for one man may not be best for another. The options include watchful waiting, surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy. You may have a combination of treatments.    NIH: National Cancer Institute</Answer>
