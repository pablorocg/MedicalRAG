			<Question qid="0000515-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Inhalants</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : If you&apos;re a parent, you may fear that your kids will use drugs such as marijuana or LSD. But you may not realize the dangers of substances in your own home. Household products such as glues, hair sprays, paints and lighter fluid can be drugs for kids in search of a quick high. Many young people inhale vapors from these, not knowing that it can cause serious health problems.    Both parents and kids need to know the dangers. Even inhaling once can disrupt heart rhythms and lower oxygen levels. Either of these can cause death. Regular abuse can result in serious harm to the brain, heart, kidneys, and liver.
