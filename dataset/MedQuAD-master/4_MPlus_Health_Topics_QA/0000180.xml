			<Question qid="0000180-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Child Mental Health</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : It&apos;s important to recognize and treat mental illnesses in children early on. Once mental illness develops, it becomes a regular part of your child&apos;s behavior and is more difficult to treat.    But it&apos;s not always easy to know when your child has a serious problem. Everyday stresses can cause changes in your child&apos;s behavior. For example, getting a new brother or sister or going to a new school may cause a child to temporarily act out. Warning signs that it might be a more serious problem include       - Problems in more than one setting (at school, at home, with peers)    - Changes in appetite or sleep    - Social withdrawal or fear of things he or she did not used to be not afraid of    - Returning to behaviors more common in younger children, such as bedwetting    - Signs of being upset, such as sadness or tearfulness    - Signs of self-destructive behavior, such as head-banging or suddenly getting hurt often    - Repeated thoughts of death       To diagnose mental health problems, the doctor or mental health specialist looks at your child&apos;s signs and symptoms, medical history, and family history. Treatments include medicines and talk therapy.    NIH: National Institute of Mental Health</Answer>
