			<Answer>A fever is a body temperature that is higher than normal. It is not an illness. It is part of your body&apos;s defense against infection. Most bacteria and viruses that cause infections do well at the body&apos;s normal temperature (98.6 F). A slight fever can make it harder for them to survive. Fever also activates your body&apos;s immune system.    Infections cause most fevers. There can be many other causes, including       -  Medicines    -  Heat exhaustion    -  Cancers    -  Autoimmune diseases       Treatment depends on the cause of your fever. Your health care provider may recommend using over-the-counter medicines such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to lower a very high fever. Adults can also take aspirin, but children with fevers should not take aspirin. It is also important to drink enough liquids to prevent dehydration.</Answer>
