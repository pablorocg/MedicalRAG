			<Answer>A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. There are nearly 7,000 rare diseases. More than 25 million Americans have one.    Rare diseases       - May involve chronic illness, disability, and often premature death    - Often have no treatment or not very effective treatment    - Are frequently not diagnosed correctly    - Are often very complex    - Are often caused by changes in genes       It can be hard to find a specialist who knows how to treat your rare disease. Disease advocacy groups, rare disease organizations, and genetics clinics may help you to find one.    NIH: National Institutes of Health</Answer>
