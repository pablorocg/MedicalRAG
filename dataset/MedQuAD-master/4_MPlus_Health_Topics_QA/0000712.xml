			<Question qid="0000712-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Piercing and Tattoos ?</Question>
			<Answer>Piercings and tattoos are body decorations that go back to ancient times. Body piercing involves making a hole in the skin so that you can insert jewelry. This is often in the earlobe, but can be in other parts of the body. Tattoos are designs on the skin made with needles and colored ink. A permanent tattoo is meant to last forever. Permanent makeup is a type of tattoo.     The health risks of piercings and tattoos include       - Allergic reactions     - Keloids, a type of scar that forms during healing    - Infections, such as hepatitis        To reduce the risks, make sure that the facility is clean, safe and has a good reputation. Proper sterilization of the equipment is important. Be sure to follow the instructions on caring for your skin.     Holes from piercing usually close up if you no longer wear the jewelry. It is possible to remove tattoos, but it&apos;s painful and can cause scarring.</Answer>
