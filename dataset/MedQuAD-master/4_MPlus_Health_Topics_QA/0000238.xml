			<Question qid="0000238-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Coronary Artery Disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease. It is the leading cause of death in the United States in both men and women.    CAD happens when the arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows, less blood can flow through the arteries. As a result, the heart muscle can&apos;t get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack. Most heart attacks happen when a blood clot suddenly cuts off the hearts&apos; blood supply, causing permanent heart damage.     Over time, CAD can also weaken the heart muscle and contribute to heart failure and arrhythmias. Heart failure means the heart can&apos;t pump blood well to the rest of the body. Arrhythmias are changes in the normal beating rhythm of the heart.     NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</Answer>
