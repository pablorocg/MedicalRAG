			<Question qid="0000218-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Colonic Polyps ?</Question>
			<Answer>A polyp is an extra piece of tissue that grows inside your body. Colonic polyps grow in the large intestine, or colon. Most polyps are not dangerous. However, some polyps may turn into cancer or already be cancer. To be safe, doctors remove polyps and test them. Polyps can be removed when a doctor examines the inside of the large intestine during a colonoscopy.    Anyone can get polyps, but certain people are more likely than others. You may have a greater chance of getting polyps if you        -  Are over age 50     -  Have had polyps before     -  Have a family member with polyps     -  Have a family history of colon cancer        Most colon polyps do not cause symptoms. If you have symptoms, they may include blood on your underwear or on toilet paper after a bowel movement, blood in your stool, or constipation or diarrhea lasting more than a week.
