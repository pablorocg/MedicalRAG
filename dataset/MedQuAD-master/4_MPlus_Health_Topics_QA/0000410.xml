			<Answer>Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener&apos;s granulomatosis, is a rare disease. It is a type of vasculitis, or inflammation of the blood vessels. The inflammation limits the flow of blood to important organs, causing damage. It can affect any organ, but it mainly affects the sinuses, nose, trachea (windpipe), lungs, and kidneys.     The cause of GPA is unknown. It can affect people at any age. Men and women are equally affected. It is more common in whites. Symptoms may include joint pain, weakness, tiredness, and cold symptoms such as a runny nose that doesn&apos;t get better. Doctors use blood tests, chest X-rays, and biopsies to diagnose GPA and rule out other causes of the symptoms.    Early treatment is important. Most people improve with medicines to slow or stop the inflammation.     NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</Answer>
