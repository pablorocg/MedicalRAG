			<Question qid="0000435-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Health Screening</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Screenings are tests that look for diseases before you have symptoms. Screening tests can find diseases early, when they&apos;re easier to treat. You can get some screenings in your doctor&apos;s office. Others need special equipment, so you may need to go to a different office or clinic.    Some conditions that doctors commonly screen for include       - Breast cancer and cervical cancer in women    - Colorectal cancer    - Diabetes    - High blood pressure    - High cholesterol    - Osteoporosis    - Overweight and obesity    - Prostate cancer in men       Which tests you need depends on your age, your sex, your family history, and whether you have risk factors for certain diseases. After a screening test, ask when you will get the results and whom to talk to about them.    Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality</Answer>
