			<Question qid="0000545-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Laboratory Tests</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Laboratory tests check a sample of your blood, urine, or body tissues. A technician or your doctor analyzes the test samples to see if your results fall within the normal range. The tests use a range because what is normal differs from person to person. Many factors affect test results. These include       -  Your sex, age and race    -  What you eat and drink    -  Medicines you take    -  How well you followed pre-test instructions       Your doctor may also compare your results to results from previous tests. Laboratory tests are often part of a routine checkup to look for changes in your health. They also help doctors diagnose medical conditions, plan or evaluate treatments, and monitor diseases.</Answer>
