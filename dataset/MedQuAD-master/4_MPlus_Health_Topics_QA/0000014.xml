			<Question qid="0000014-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Adrenal Gland Cancer ?</Question>
			<Answer>Your adrenal, or suprarenal, glands are located on the top of each kidney. These glands produce hormones that you can&apos;t live without, including sex hormones and cortisol, which helps you respond to stress and has many other functions.    A number of disorders can affect the adrenal glands, including tumors. Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren&apos;t cancer. Malignant ones are. Most adrenal gland tumors are benign. They usually do not cause symptoms and may not require treatment. Malignant adrenal gland cancers are uncommon.    Types of tumors include       - Adrenocortical carcinoma - cancer in the outer part of the gland    - Neuroblastoma, a type of childhood cancer    - Pheochromocytoma - a rare tumor that is usually benign       Symptoms depend on the type of cancer you have. Treatments may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.</Answer>
