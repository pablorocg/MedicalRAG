			<Question qid="0000276-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Diabetic Foot ?</Question>
			<Answer>If you have diabetes, your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Over time, this can damage your nerves or blood vessels. Nerve damage from diabetes can cause you to lose feeling in your feet. You may not feel a cut, a blister or a sore. Foot injuries such as these can cause ulcers and infections. Serious cases may even lead to amputation. Damage to the blood vessels can also mean that your feet do not get enough blood and oxygen. It is harder for your foot to heal, if you do get a sore or infection.    You can help avoid foot problems. First, control your blood sugar levels. Good foot hygiene is also crucial:       - Check your feet every day    - Wash your feet every day    - Keep the skin soft and smooth    - Smooth corns and calluses gently    - If you can see, reach, and feel your feet, trim your toenails regularly. If you cannot, ask a foot doctor (podiatrist) to trim them for you.    - Wear shoes and socks at all times    - Protect your feet from hot and cold    - Keep the blood flowing to your feet       NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</Answer>
