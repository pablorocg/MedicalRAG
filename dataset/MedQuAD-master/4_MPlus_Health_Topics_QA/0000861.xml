			<Question qid="0000861-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Suicide ?</Question>
			<Answer>Suicide is the tenth most common cause of death in the United States. People may consider suicide when they are hopeless and can&apos;t see any other solution to their problems. Often it&apos;s related to serious depression, alcohol or substance abuse, or a major stressful event.    People who have the highest risk of suicide are white men. But women and teens report more suicide attempts. If someone talks about suicide, you should take it seriously. Urge them to get help from their doctor or the emergency room, or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). It is available 24/7.    Therapy and medicines can help most people who have suicidal thoughts. Treating mental illnesses and substance abuse can reduce the risk of suicide.
