			<Question qid="0000776-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Restless Legs ?</Question>
			<Answer>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) causes a powerful urge to move your legs. Your legs become uncomfortable when you are lying down or sitting. Some people describe it as a creeping, crawling, tingling, or burning sensation. Moving makes your legs feel better, but not for long. RLS can make it hard to fall asleep and stay asleep.    In most cases, there is no known cause for RLS. In other cases, RLS is caused by a disease or condition, such as anemia or pregnancy. Some medicines can also cause temporary RLS. Caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol may make symptoms worse.    Lifestyle changes, such as regular sleep habits, relaxation techniques, and moderate exercise during the day can help. If those don&apos;t work, medicines may reduce the symptoms of RLS.    Most people with RLS also have a condition called periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). PLMD is a condition in which a person&apos;s legs twitch or jerk uncontrollably, usually during sleep. PLMD and RLS can also affect the arms.
