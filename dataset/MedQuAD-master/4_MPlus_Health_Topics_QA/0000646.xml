			<Question qid="0000646-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Neuromuscular Disorders ?</Question>
			<Answer>Neuromuscular disorders affect the nerves that control your voluntary muscles. Voluntary muscles are the ones you can control, like in your arms and legs. Your nerve cells, also called neurons, send the messages that control these muscles. When the neurons become unhealthy or die, communication between your nervous system and muscles breaks down. As a result, your muscles weaken and waste away. The weakness can lead to twitching, cramps, aches and pains, and joint and movement problems. Sometimes it also affects heart function and your ability to breathe.     Examples of neuromuscular disorders include       - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis    - Multiple sclerosis    - Myasthenia gravis    - Spinal muscular atrophy        Many neuromuscular diseases are genetic, which means they run in families or there is a mutation in your genes. Sometimes, an immune system disorder can cause them. Most of them have no cure. The goal of treatment is to improve symptoms, increase mobility and lengthen life.</Answer>
