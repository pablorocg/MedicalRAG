			<Answer>Your throat is a tube that carries food to your esophagus and air to your windpipe and larynx. The technical name for throat is pharynx.     Throat problems are common. You&apos;ve probably had a sore throat. The cause is usually a viral infection, but other causes include allergies, infection with strep bacteria or the upward movement of stomach acids into the esophagus, called GERD.     Other problems that affect the throat include       - Tonsillitis - an infection in the tonsils    - Pharyngitis - inflammation of the pharynx     - Cancers     - Croup - inflammation, usually in small children, which causes a barking cough       Most throat problems are minor and go away on their own. Treatments, when needed, depend on the problem.</Answer>
