			<Question qid="0000399-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Genetic Testing</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Genetic tests are tests on blood and other tissue to find genetic disorders. Over 2000 tests are available. Doctors use genetic tests for several reasons. These include       - Finding genetic diseases in unborn babies    - Finding out if people carry a gene for a disease and might pass it on to their children    - Screening embryos for disease     - Testing for genetic diseases in adults before they cause symptoms    - Making a diagnosis in a person who has disease symptoms    - Figuring out the type or dose of a medicine that is best for a certain person       People have many different reasons for being tested or not being tested. For some, it is important to know whether a disease can be prevented or treated if a test is positive. In some cases, there is no treatment. But test results might help a person make life decisions, such as family planning or insurance coverage. A genetic counselor can provide information about the pros and cons of testing.
