			<Question qid="0000705-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Personal Health Records</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : You&apos;ve probably seen your chart at your doctor&apos;s office. In fact, you may have charts at several doctors&apos; offices. If you&apos;ve been in the hospital, you have a chart there, too. These charts are your medical records. They may be on paper or electronic. To keep track of all this information, it&apos;s a good idea to keep your own personal health record.     What kind of information would you put in a personal health record? You could start with       -  Your name, birth date, blood type, and emergency contact information    -  Date of last physical    -  Dates and results of tests and screenings    -  Major illnesses and surgeries, with dates    -  A list of your medicines and supplements, the dosages, and how long you&apos;ve taken them    -  Any allergies    -  Any chronic diseases    -  Any history of illnesses in your family</Answer>
