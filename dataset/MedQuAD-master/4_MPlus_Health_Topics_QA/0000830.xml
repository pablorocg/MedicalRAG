			<Question qid="0000830-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Snoring ?</Question>
			<Answer>Snoring is the sound you make when your breathing is blocked while you are asleep. The sound is caused by tissues at the top of your airway that strike each other and vibrate. Snoring is common, especially among older people and people who are overweight.    When severe, snoring can cause frequent awakenings at night and daytime sleepiness. It can disrupt your bed partner&apos;s sleep. Snoring can also be a sign of a serious sleep disorder called sleep apnea. You should see your health care provider if you are often tired during the day, don&apos;t feel that you sleep well, or wake up gasping.    To reduce snoring       - Lose weight if you are overweight. It may help, but thin people can snore, too.    - Cut down or avoid alcohol and other sedatives at bedtime    - Don&apos;t sleep flat on your back       NIH: National Institute on Aging</Answer>
