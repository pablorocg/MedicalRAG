			<Question qid="0000756-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Puberty</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Puberty is the time in life when a boy or girl becomes sexually mature. It is a process that usually happens between ages 10 and 14 for girls and ages 12 and 16 for boys. It causes physical changes, and affects boys and girls differently.    In girls:       - The first sign of puberty is usually breast development.    - Then hair grows in the pubic area and armpits.    - Menstruation (or a period) usually happens last.       In boys:       - Puberty usually begins with the testicles and penis getting bigger.    - Then hair grows in the pubic area and armpits.    - Muscles grow, the voice deepens, and facial hair develops as puberty continues.       Both boys and girls may get acne. They also usually have a growth spurt (a rapid increase in height) that lasts for about 2 or 3 years. This brings them closer to their adult height, which they reach after puberty.     NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</Answer>
