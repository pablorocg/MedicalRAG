			<Answer>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a type of bacteria that causes infection in the stomach. It is found in about two-thirds of the world&apos;s population. It may be spread by unclean food and water, but researchers aren&apos;t sure. It causes Peptic ulcers and can also cause stomach cancer.    If you have symptoms of a peptic ulcer, your doctor will test your blood, breath or stool to see if it contains H. pylori. The best treatment is a combination of antibiotics and acid-reducing medicines. You will need to be tested after treatment to make sure the infection is gone.    To help prevent an H. pylori infection, you should       - Wash your hands after using the bathroom and before eating    - Eat properly prepared food    - Drink water from a clean, safe source       NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</Answer>
