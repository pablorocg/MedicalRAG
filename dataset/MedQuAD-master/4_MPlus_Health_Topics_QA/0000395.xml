			<Question qid="0000395-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Genes and Gene Therapy</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Genes are the building blocks of inheritance. Passed from parent to child, they contain instructions for making proteins. If genes don&apos;t produce the right proteins or don&apos;t produce them correctly, a child can have a genetic disorder.     Gene therapy is an experimental technique that uses genes to treat or prevent disease. The most common form of gene therapy involves inserting a normal gene to replace an abnormal gene. Other approaches include       -  Swapping an abnormal gene for a normal one    -  Repairing an abnormal gene    -  Altering the degree to which a gene is turned on or off       Although there is much hope for gene therapy, it is still experimental.
