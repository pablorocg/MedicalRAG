			<Answer>Sjogren&apos;s syndrome is a disease that causes dryness in your mouth and eyes. It can also lead to dryness in other places that need moisture, such as your nose, throat and skin. Most people who get Sjogren&apos;s syndrome are older than 40. Nine of 10 are women. Sjogren&apos;s syndrome is sometimes linked to rheumatic problems such as rheumatoid arthritis.    Sjogren&apos;s syndrome is an autoimmune disease. If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system, which is supposed to fight disease, mistakenly attacks parts of your own body. In Sjogren&apos;s syndrome, your immune system attacks the glands that make tears and saliva. It may also affect your joints, lungs, kidneys, blood vessels, digestive organs and nerves. The main symptoms are:       -  Dry eyes    -  Dry mouth       Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms.     NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</Answer>
