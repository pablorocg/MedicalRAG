			<Question qid="0000741-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Premature Babies</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Almost 1 of every 10 infants born in the United States are premature, or preemies. A premature birth is when a baby is born before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. A full-term pregnancy is 40 weeks.    Important growth and development happen throughout pregnancy - especially in the final months and weeks. Because they are born too early, preemies weigh much less than full-term babies. They may have health problems because their organs did not have enough time to develop. Problems that a baby born too early may have include       - Breathing problems    - Feeding difficulties    - Cerebral palsy    - Developmental delay    - Vision problems    - Hearing problems       Preemies need special medical care in a neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU. They stay there until their organ systems can work on their own.     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</Answer>
