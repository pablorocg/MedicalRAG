			<Question qid="0000978-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Wrist Injuries and Disorders ?</Question>
			<Answer>Your wrist is made up of eight small bones known as carpals. They support a tube that runs through your wrist. That tube, called the carpal tunnel, has tendons and a nerve inside. It is covered by a ligament, which holds it in place.     Wrist pain is common. Repetitive motion can damage your wrist. Everyday activities like typing, racquet sports or sewing can cause pain, or even carpal tunnel syndrome. Wrist pain with bruising and swelling can be a sign of injury. The signs of a possible fracture include misshapen joints and inability to move your wrist. Some wrist fractures are a result of osteoporosis.    Other common causes of pain are        - Sprains and strains    - Tendinitis    - Arthritis    - Gout and pseudogout</Answer>
