			<Answer>Summary : In the U.S., the government&apos;s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must approve any drug before it can be sold. This is true whether it&apos;s a prescription or an over-the-counter drug. The FDA evaluates the safety of a drug by looking at       - Side effects    - How it&apos;s manufactured    - Results of animal testing and clinical trials       The FDA also monitors a drug&apos;s safety after approval.    For you, drug safety means buying online from only legitimate pharmacies and taking your medicines correctly.</Answer>
