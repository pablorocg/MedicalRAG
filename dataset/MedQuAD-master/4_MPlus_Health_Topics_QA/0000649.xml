			<Answer>Noroviruses are a group of related viruses. Infection with these viruses causes an illness called gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach and intestines. It can spread from person to person, or through contaminated food or water. You can also get it if you touch a contaminated surface. Norovirus can be serious, especially for young children and older adults.    The most common symptoms of norovirus infection are       - Diarrhea    - Nausea and vomiting    - Stomach pain       Other symptoms may include fever, headache or body aches.
