			<Answer>Athlete&apos;s foot is a common infection caused by a fungus. It most often affects the space between the toes. Symptoms include itching, burning, and cracked, scaly skin between your toes.    You can get athlete&apos;s foot from damp surfaces, such as showers, swimming pools, and locker room floors. To prevent it       - Keep your feet clean, dry, and cool    - Wear clean socks    - Don&apos;t walk barefoot in public areas    - Wear flip-flops in locker room showers    - Keep your toenails clean and clipped short       Treatments include over-the-counter antifungal creams for most cases and prescription medicines for more serious infections. These usually clear up the infection, but it can come back.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</Answer>
