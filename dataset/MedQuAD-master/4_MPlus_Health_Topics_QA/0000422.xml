			<Question qid="0000422-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Hazardous Waste</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Even if you use them properly, many chemicals can still harm human health and the environment. When you throw these substances away, they become hazardous waste. Some hazardous wastes come from products in our homes. Our garbage can include such hazardous wastes as old batteries, bug spray cans and paint thinner. U.S. residents generate 1.6 million tons of household hazardous waste per year. Hazardous waste is also a by-product of manufacturing.     You may have hazardous wastes in your basement or garage. How do you get rid of them? Don&apos;t pour them down the drain, flush them, or put them in the garbage. See if you can donate or recycle. Many communities have household hazardous waste collection programs. Check to see if there is one in your area.    Environmental Protection Agency</Answer>
