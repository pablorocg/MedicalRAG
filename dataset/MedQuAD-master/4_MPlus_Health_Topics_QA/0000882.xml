			<Question qid="0000882-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Testicular Cancer ?</Question>
			<Answer>Testicles, or testes, make male hormones and sperm. They are two egg-shaped organs inside the scrotum, the loose sac of skin behind the penis. You can get cancer in one or both testicles.    Testicular cancer mainly affects young men between the ages of 20 and 39. It is also more common in men who       - Have had abnormal testicle development    - Have had an undescended testicle    - Have a family history of the cancer       Symptoms include pain, swelling, or lumps in your testicles or groin area. Doctors use a physical exam, lab tests, imaging tests, and a biopsy to diagnose testicular cancer. Most cases can be treated, especially if found early. Treatment options include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Regular exams after treatment are important.    Treatments may also cause infertility. If you may want children later on, you should consider sperm banking before treatment.    NIH: National Cancer Institute</Answer>
