			<Question qid="0000123-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Brachial Plexus Injuries ?</Question>
			<Answer>The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that conducts signals from the spine to the shoulder, arm, and hand. Brachial plexus injuries are caused by damage to those nerves.    Symptoms may include       - A limp or paralyzed arm    - Lack of muscle control in the arm, hand, or wrist    - Lack of feeling or sensation in the arm or hand       Brachial plexus injuries can occur as a result of shoulder trauma, tumors, or inflammation. Sometimes they happen during childbirth when a baby&apos;s shoulders become stuck during delivery and the nerves stretch or tear.    Some brachial plexus injuries may heal without treatment. Many children who are injured during birth improve or recover by 3 to 4 months of age. Treatment includes physical therapy and, in some cases, surgery.
