			<Question qid="0000019-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Air Pollution</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Air pollution is a mixture of solid particles and gases in the air. Car emissions, chemicals from factories, dust, pollen and mold spores may be suspended as particles. Ozone, a gas, is a major part of air pollution in cities. When ozone forms air pollution, it&apos;s also called smog.    Some air pollutants are poisonous. Inhaling them can increase the chance you&apos;ll have health problems. People with heart or lung disease, older adults and children are at greater risk from air pollution. Air pollution isn&apos;t just outside - the air inside buildings can also be polluted and affect your health.    Environmental Protection Agency</Answer>
