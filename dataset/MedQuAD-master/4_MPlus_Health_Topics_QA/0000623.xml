			<Question qid="0000623-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Movement Disorders ?</Question>
			<Answer>Imagine if parts of your body moved when you didn&apos;t want them to. If you have a movement disorder, you experience these kinds of impaired movement. Dyskinesia is abnormal uncontrolled movement and is a common symptom of many movement disorders. Tremors are a type of dyskinesia.     Nerve diseases cause many movement disorders, such as Parkinson&apos;s disease. Other causes include injuries, autoimmune diseases, infections and certain medicines. Many movement disorders are inherited, which means they run in families.    Treatment varies by disorder. Medicine can cure some disorders. Others get better when an underlying disease is treated. Often, however, there is no cure. In that case, the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms and relieve pain.</Answer>
