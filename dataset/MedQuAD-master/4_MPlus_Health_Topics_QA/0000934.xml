			<Question qid="0000934-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Usher Syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Usher syndrome is an inherited disease that causes serious hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa, an eye disorder that causes your vision to get worse over time. It is the most common condition that affects both hearing and vision.    There are three types of Usher syndrome:       - People with type I are deaf from birth and have severe balance problems from a young age. Vision problems usually start by age 10 and lead to blindness.    - People with type II have moderate to severe hearing loss and normal balance. Vision problems start in the early teens and get worse more slowly than in type I.    - People with type III are born with normal hearing and near-normal balance but develop vision problems and then hearing loss.       There is no cure. Tools such as hearing aids or cochlear implants can help some people. Training such as Braille instruction, low-vision services, or auditory training can also help.
