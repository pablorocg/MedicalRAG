			<Question qid="0000230-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Connective Tissue Disorders ?</Question>
			<Answer>Connective tissue is the material inside your body that supports many of its parts. It is the &quot;cellular glue&quot; that gives your tissues their shape and helps keep them strong. It also helps some of your tissues do their work. Cartilage and fat are examples of connective tissue.      There are over 200 disorders that impact connective tissue. Some, like cellulitis, are the result of an infection. Injuries can cause connective tissue disorders, such as scars. Others, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta, are genetic. Still others, like scleroderma, have no known cause. Each disorder has its own symptoms and needs different treatment.</Answer>
