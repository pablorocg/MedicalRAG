			<Question qid="0000761-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Quitting Smoking</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Tobacco use is the most common preventable cause of death. About half of the people who don&apos;t quit smoking will die of smoking-related problems. Quitting smoking is important for your health.    Soon after you quit, your circulation begins to improve, and your blood pressure starts to return to normal. Your sense of smell and taste return, and it&apos;s easier for you to breathe. In the long term, giving up tobacco can help you live longer. Your risk of getting cancer decreases with each year you stay smoke-free.    Quitting is not easy. You may have short-term affects such as weight gain, irritability, and anxiety. Some people try several times before they succeed. There are many ways to quit smoking. Some people stop &quot;cold turkey.&quot; Others benefit from step-by-step manuals, counseling, or medicines or products that help reduce nicotine addiction. Some people think that switching to e-cigarettes can help you quit smoking, but that has not been proven. Your health care provider can help you find the best way for you to quit.
