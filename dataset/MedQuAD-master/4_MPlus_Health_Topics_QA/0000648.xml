			<Question qid="0000648-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Noise</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Noise is all around you, from televisions and radios to lawn mowers and washing machines. Normally, you hear these sounds at safe levels that don&apos;t affect hearing. But sounds that are too loud or loud sounds over a long time are harmful. They can damage sensitive structures of the inner ear and cause noise-induced hearing loss.    More than 30 million Americans are exposed to hazardous sound levels on a regular basis. Hazardous sound levels are louder than 80 decibels. That&apos;s not as loud as traffic on a busy street. Listening to loud music, especially on headphones, is a common cause of noise-induced hearing loss. You can protect your hearing by       - Keeping the volume down when listening to music    - Wearing earplugs when using loud equipment       NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</Answer>
