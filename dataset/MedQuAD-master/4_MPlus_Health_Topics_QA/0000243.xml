			<Question qid="0000243-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about CPR</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : When someone&apos;s blood flow or breathing stops, seconds count. Permanent brain damage or death can happen quickly. If you know how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), you could save a life. CPR is an emergency procedure for a person whose heart has stopped or is no longer breathing. CPR can maintain circulation and breathing until emergency medical help arrives.    Even if you haven&apos;t had training, you can do &quot;hands-only&quot; CPR for a teen or adult whose heart has stopped beating (&quot;hands-only&quot; CPR isn&apos;t recommended for children). &quot;Hands-only&quot; CPR uses chest compressions to keep blood circulating until emergency help arrives. If you&apos;ve had training, you can use chest compressions, clear the airway, and do rescue breathing. Rescue breathing helps get oxygen to the lungs for a person who has stopped breathing. To keep your skills up, you should repeat the training every two years.</Answer>
