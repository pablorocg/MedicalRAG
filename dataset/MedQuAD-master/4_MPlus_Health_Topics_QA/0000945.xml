			<Question qid="0000945-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Vasectomy</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Vasectomy is a type of surgery that prevents a man from being able to get a woman pregnant. It is a permanent form of birth control.    Vasectomy works by blocking the tube through which sperm pass. The surgery usually takes no more than 30 minutes. Almost all men go home the same day. In most cases, recovery takes less than a week.    Vasectomy can sometimes be reversed, but not always. Having a vasectomy does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV/AIDS. Men who have had vasectomy should still practice safe sex to avoid STDs.    NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</Answer>
