			<Question qid="0000508-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Infant and Newborn Nutrition</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Food provides the energy and nutrients that babies need to be healthy. For a baby, breast milk is best. It has all the necessary vitamins and minerals. Infant formulas are available for babies whose mothers are not able or decide not to breastfeed.    Infants usually start eating solid foods between 4 and 6 months of age. Check with your health care provider for the best time for your baby to start. If you introduce one new food at a time, you will be able to identify any foods that cause allergies in your baby. Some foods to stay away from include       - Eggs    - Honey    - Peanuts (including peanut butter)    - Other tree nuts</Answer>
