			<Question qid="0000442-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Heart Attack ?</Question>
			<Answer>Each year over a million people in the U.S. have a heart attack. About half of them die. Many people have permanent heart damage or die because they don&apos;t get help immediately. It&apos;s important to know the symptoms of a heart attack and call 9-1-1 if someone is having them. Those symptoms include       - Chest discomfort - pressure, squeezing, or pain     - Shortness of breath     - Discomfort in the upper body - arms, shoulder, neck, back     - Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, sweating        These symptoms can sometimes be different in women.    What exactly is a heart attack? Most heart attacks happen when a clot in the coronary artery blocks the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. Often this leads to an irregular heartbeat - called an arrhythmia - that causes a severe decrease in the pumping function of the heart. A blockage that is not treated within a few hours causes the affected heart muscle to die.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</Answer>
