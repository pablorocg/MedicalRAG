			<Question qid="0000355-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Fatigue ?</Question>
			<Answer>Everyone feels tired now and then. Sometimes you may just want to stay in bed. But, after a good night&apos;s sleep, most people feel refreshed and ready to face a new day. If you continue to feel tired for weeks, it&apos;s time to see your doctor. He or she may be able to help you find out what&apos;s causing your fatigue and recommend ways to relieve it.    Fatigue itself is not a disease. Medical problems, treatments, and personal habits can add to fatigue. These include       - Taking certain medicines, such as antidepressants, antihistamines, and medicines for nausea and pain    - Having medical treatments, like chemotherapy and radiation    - Recovering from major surgery    - Anxiety, stress, or depression    - Staying up too late    - Drinking too much alcohol or too many caffeinated drinks    - Pregnancy       One disorder that causes extreme fatigue is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This fatigue is not the kind of tired feeling that goes away after you rest. Instead, it lasts a long time and limits your ability to do ordinary daily activities.
