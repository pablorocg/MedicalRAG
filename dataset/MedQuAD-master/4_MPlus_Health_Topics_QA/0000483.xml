			<Answer>Hodgkin disease is a type of lymphoma. Lymphoma is a cancer of a part of the immune system called the lymph system. The first sign of Hodgkin disease is often an enlarged lymph node. The disease can spread to nearby lymph nodes. Later it may spread to the lungs, liver, or bone marrow. The exact cause is unknown.     Hodgkin disease is rare. Symptoms include       - Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, or groin     - Fever and chills     - Night sweats     - Weight loss     - Loss of appetite     - Itchy skin       To diagnose Hodgkin disease, doctors use a physical exam and history, blood tests, and a biopsy. Treatment depends on how far the disease has spread. It often includes radiation therapy or chemotherapy.    The earlier the disease is diagnosed, the more effective the treatment. In most cases, Hodgkin disease can be cured.     NIH: National Cancer Institute</Answer>
