			<Question qid="0000321-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Electromagnetic Fields</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : Electric and magnetic fields (EMFs) are areas of energy that surround electrical devices. Everyday sources of EMFs include       - Power lines    - Electrical wiring    - Microwave ovens    - Computers    - Cell phones       Some people worry about EMF exposure and cancer. Some studies have found a link between EMF exposure and a higher risk of childhood leukemia, but other studies have not. Other studies have not found proof that EMF exposure causes other childhood cancers. Studies in adults did not prove that EMF exposure causes cancer.    Some people worry that wireless and cellular phones cause cancer. They give off radio-frequency energy (RF), a form of electromagnetic radiation. Scientists need to do more research on this before they can say for sure.    NIH: National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</Answer>
