			<Question qid="0000735-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Preconception Care</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : If you are trying to have a baby or are just thinking about it, it is not too early to prepare for a safe pregnancy and a healthy baby. You should speak with your healthcare provider about preconception care.    Preconception care is care you receive before you get pregnant. It involves finding and taking care of any problems that might affect you and your baby later, like diabetes or high blood pressure. It also involves steps you can take to reduce the risk of birth defects and other problems. For example, you should take folic acid supplements to prevent neural tube defects.     By taking action on health issues before pregnancy, you can prevent many future problems for yourself and your baby. Once you&apos;re pregnant, you&apos;ll get prenatal care until your baby is born.    National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities</Answer>
