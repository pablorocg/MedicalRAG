			<Question qid="0000561-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Liver Diseases ?</Question>
			<Answer>Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons.    There are many kinds of liver diseases. Viruses cause some of them, like hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Others can be the result of drugs, poisons or drinking too much alcohol. If the liver forms scar tissue because of an illness, it&apos;s called cirrhosis. Jaundice, or yellowing of the skin, can be one sign of liver disease.     Cancer can affect the liver. You could also inherit a liver disease such as hemochromatosis.     Tests such as imaging tests and liver function tests can check for liver damage and help to diagnose liver diseases.</Answer>
