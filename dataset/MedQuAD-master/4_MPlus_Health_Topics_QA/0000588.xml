			<Question qid="0000588-1" qtype="information">Do you have information about Medical Ethics</Question>
			<Answer>Summary : The field of ethics studies principles of right and wrong. There is hardly an area in medicine that doesn&apos;t have an ethical aspect. For example, there are ethical issues relating to        - End of life care: Should a patient receive nutrition? What about advance directives and resuscitation orders?    - Abortion: When does life begin? Is it ethical to terminate a pregnancy with a birth defect?    - Genetic and prenatal testing: What happens if you are a carrier of a defect? What if testing shows that your unborn baby has a defect?    - Birth control: Should it be available to minors?    - Is it ethical to harvest embryonic stem cells to treat diseases?    - Organ donation: Must a relative donate an organ to a sick relative?    - Your personal health information: who has access to your records?    - Patient rights: Do you have the right to refuse treatment?    - When you talk with your doctor, is it ethical for her to withhold information from you or your family?</Answer>
