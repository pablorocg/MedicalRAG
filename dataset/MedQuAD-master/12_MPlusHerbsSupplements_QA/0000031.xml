			<Question qid="0000031-1" qtype="information">What is Creatine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Creatine is a chemical found naturally in the body. It's also in red meat and seafood. It is often used to improve exercise performance and muscle mass. 

Creatine is involved in making energy for muscles. About 95% of it is found in skeletal muscle. The majority of sports supplements in the US contain creatine. People who have lower creatine levels when they start taking creatine seem to get more benefit than people who start with higher levels. 

People commonly use creatine for improving exercise performance and increasing muscle mass. It is also used for muscle cramps, fatigue, multiple sclerosis (MS), depression, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.  

Creatine use is allowed by the International Olympic Committee and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

			<Question qid="0000031-2" qtype="how effective is it">How effective is Creatine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database  rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate. The effectiveness ratings for  CREATINE  are as follows: Possibly effective for... 
 Athletic performance . Taking creatine by mouth seems to somewhat improve rowing, jumping, and soccer performance. It's not clear if it helps with sprinting, cycling, swimming, or tennis., 

 Disorders of creatine metabolism or transport . Taking creatine by mouth daily can increase creatine levels in the brain in children and young adults with conditions called GAMT deficiency or AGAT deficiency. But taking creatine doesn't seem to improve brain creatine levels in children who have a disorder in which creatine isn't transported properly. ,  


 Muscle strength . Taking creatine by mouth seems to somewhat improve muscle strength in both younger and older adults. It's not clear if applying creatine to the skin helps., 

 Age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia) . Taking creatine by mouth for up to 12 weeks seems to improve muscle strength in older adults. It seems to work best when used along with exercise to build muscles. ,  
 Possibly ineffective for... 

 Lou Gehrig disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS) . Taking creatine by mouth does not seem to slow disease progression or improve survival in people with ALS., 

 An inherited brain disorder that affects movements, emotions, and thinking (Huntington disease) . Taking creatine by mouth does not improve symptoms in people with Huntington disease., 

 Low bone mass (osteopenia) . Taking creatine by mouth doesn't seem to slow or reduce bone loss in people with osteopenia. , 

 

There is interest in using creatine for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.</Answer>
