			<Question qid="0000056-1" qtype="information">What is Lipase ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lipase is an enzyme that breaks down fats during digestion. It is found in many plants, animals, bacteria, and molds. Some people use lipase as a medicine. 

Since lipase breaks down fat into smaller pieces, it is possible that lipase supplements might make digestion easier. 

Lipase is used for indigestion (dyspepsia), heartburn, and other gastrointestinal problems, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. 

Do not confuse lipase with pancreatic enzyme products. Pancreatic enzyme products contain multiple ingredients, including lipase. Some of these products are approved by the US FDA for digestion problems due to a disorder of the pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency).
