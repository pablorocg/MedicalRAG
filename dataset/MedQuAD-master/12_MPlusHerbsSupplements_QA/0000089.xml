			<Question qid="0000089-1" qtype="information">What is Slippery Elm ?</Question>
			<Answer>Slippery elm (Ulmus rubra) is a tree that is native to North America. Its inner bark feels slippery when chewed and may be effective for soothing sore throat. 

Only the inner bark of slippery elm, not the whole bark, is used as medicine. The inner bark contains chemicals that can increase mucous secretion, which might be helpful for stomach and intestinal problems.  

People use slippery elm for sore throat, constipation, stomach ulcers, skin disorders, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.</Answer>

			<Answer>Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Medications taken by mouth (Oral drugs) Slippery elm contains a type of soft fiber called mucilage. Mucilage can decrease how much medicine the body absorbs. Taking slippery elm at the same time you take medications by mouth can decrease the effectiveness of your medication. To prevent this interaction, take slippery elm at least one hour after medications you take by mouth.</Answer>
