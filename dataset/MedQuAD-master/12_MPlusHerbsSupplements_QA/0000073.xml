			<Question qid="0000073-1" qtype="information">What is Pau D'arco ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pau d'arco (Tabebuia impetiginosa) is a tree that is native to the Amazon. Its bark and wood have been used for many conditions, but with little evidence. 

The pau d'arco tree is used by native peoples in the regions where it grows for making hunting bows. The name "pau d'arco" is Portuguese for "bow tree." Pau d'arco bark and wood might prevent cancer cells from growing and slow tumor growth. But the doses needed to cause these effects seem to be unsafe. 

People use pau d'arco for cancer, diabetes, stomach ulcers, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Using pau d'arco can also be unsafe, especially at higher doses. 

Pau d'arco is sometimes called quebracho. Don't confuse this with a different plant called Quebracho Blanco. These are not the same.
