			<Question qid="0000066-1" qtype="information">What is Olive ?</Question>
			<Answer>Olive (Olea europaea) is a tree with edible fruit, leaves, and seeds. The fruit and leaves are sometimes used as medicine. 

Olive leaf might lower blood pressure. Olive fruit might also be able to kill microbes, such as bacteria and fungus. 

People use olive for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support its uses.  

Don't confuse olive with olive oil, the oil from olive fruit. These are not the same.
