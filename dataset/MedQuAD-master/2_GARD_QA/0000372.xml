			<Answer>Annular atrophic lichen planus (LP) is a rare form of lichen planus, which is a condition that affects the skin and/or mouth. In annular atrophic LP, specifically, affected people develop skin lesions with features of both annular LP and atrophic LP - ring-shaped, slightly raised, purple lesions with central atrophy (tissue breakdown). Although these lesions can be found anywhere on the body, they most commonly affect the trunk and legs. The exact underlying cause of annular atrophic LP is unknown. Treatment is not always necessary as some cases of annular atrophic LP resolve on their own. Mild cases that are diagnosed early can often be managed with topical steroids, while more intensive therapies may be required for severe cases.</Answer>
