			<Question qid="0002561-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Glass-Chapman-Hockley syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>The Glass-Chapman-Hockley syndrome is a very rare disease. To date, the syndrome has only been reported in one family with five members affected in three generations. The first patients were two brothers that had an abnormally-shaped head due to coronal craniosynostosis. Their mother, maternal aunt, and maternal grandmother were also found to have the syndrome. The signs and symptoms varied from person to person; however, the signs and symptoms included coronal craniosynostosis, small middle part of the face (midfacial hypoplasia), and short fingers (brachydactyly). The inheritance is thought to be autosomal dominant. No genes have been identified for this syndrome. Treatment included surgery to correct the craniosynostosis. No issues with development and normal intelligence were reported.</Answer>

			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Glass-Chapman-Hockley syndrome? Glass-Chapman-Hockley syndrome has only been described in one family with five affected family members in three generations. The signs and symptoms seen in the five affected family members varied, but included the following: Premature or early growing together or fusing of the coronal suture. The coronal suture is found between the parts of the skull called the frontal bone and the two parietal bones. Forehead tends to be recessed and flattened.  Eye socket is elevated and tilted with protruding eyes.  Nose slants to one side.  Very small fingers (brachydactyl). The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Glass-Chapman-Hockley syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the distal phalanx of finger 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 90% Craniosynostosis 90% Frontal bossing 90% Malar flattening 90% Tapered finger 90% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002561-4" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Glass-Chapman-Hockley syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>How might Glass-Chapman-Hockley syndrome be treated? Surgery is typically the treatment for craniosynostosis and is based on the person&apos;s specific signs and symptoms. The goal is to increase the space in the front (anterior) part of the skull. The operation is usually performed when the person is between 9 to 12 months of age. If other sutures, other than the coronal suture, are involved, other surgeries may be performed.</Answer>
