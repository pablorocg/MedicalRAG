			<Question qid="0005859-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Spondylospinal thoracic dysostosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Spondylospinal thoracic dysostosis is an extremely rare skeletal disorder characterized by a short, curved spine and fusion of the spinous processes, short thorax with &apos;crab-like&apos; configuration of the ribs, underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), severe arthrogryposis and multiple pterygia (webbing of the skin across joints), and underdevelopment of the bones of the mouth. This condition is believed to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It does not appear to be compatible with life.</Answer>

			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Spondylospinal thoracic dysostosis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Spondylospinal thoracic dysostosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Hypoplasia of the maxilla - Multiple pterygia - Pulmonary hypoplasia - Short thorax - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
