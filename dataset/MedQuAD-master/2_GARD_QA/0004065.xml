			<Answer>Mikulicz disease is a chronic condition characterized by the abnormal enlargement of glands in the head and neck, including those near the ears (parotids), around the eyes (lacrimal), and around the mouth (salivary). The tonsils and other glands in the soft tissue of the face and neck can also be affected. Although this condition is usually benign, it always occurs in association with another underlying disorder such as tuberculosis, leukemia, syphilis, Hodgkin&apos;s disease, Sjogren syndrome, or systemic lupus erythematosus. People with Mikulicz disease are at greater risk of developing lymphomas. Some people may experience recurring fevers accompanied by dry eyes, diminished tear production, and inflammation of various parts of the eyes (uveitis). The exact cause of Mikulicz syndrome is unknown. But some researchers believe that it should be considered a form of Sjogren syndrome.</Answer>
