			<Question qid="0003813-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Marshall syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Marshall syndrome is an inherited condition characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, eye abnormalities, hearing loss, and early-onset arthritis. Those with Marshall syndrome can also have short stature. Some researchers have argued that Marshall syndrome represents a variant form of Stickler syndrome; but this remains controversial. Marshall syndrome is caused by mutations in the COL11A1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003813-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Marshall syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Marshall syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Marshall syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Anteverted nares 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia involving the nose 90% Arthralgia 90% Depressed nasal bridge 90% Hypertelorism 90% Hypoplasia of the zygomatic bone 90% Long philtrum 90% Malar flattening 90% Myopia 90% Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Short stature 90% Thick lower lip vermilion 90% Abnormal hair quantity 50% Abnormality of the vitreous humor 50% Cleft palate 50% Craniofacial hyperostosis 50% Genu valgum 50% Glaucoma 50% Hypohidrosis 50% Osteoarthritis 50% Proptosis 50% Retinal detachment 50% Visual impairment 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the eyebrow 7.5% Frontal bossing 7.5% Nystagmus 7.5% Absent frontal sinuses - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Calcification of falx cerebri - Congenital cataract - Coxa valga - Epicanthus - Esotropia - Flat midface - Hypoplastic ilia - Irregular distal femoral epiphysis - Irregular proximal tibial epiphyses - Lens luxation - Low-set ears - Macrodontia of permanent maxillary central incisor - Meningeal calcification - Pierre-Robin sequence - Platyspondyly - Radial bowing - Short nose - Small distal femoral epiphysis - Small proximal tibial epiphyses - Thick upper lip vermilion - Thickened calvaria - Ulnar bowing - Vitreoretinal degeneration - Wide tufts of distal phalanges - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
