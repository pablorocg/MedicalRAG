			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Pseudoprogeria syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Pseudoprogeria syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the eyelashes 90% Abnormality of the teeth 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the eyebrow 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Convex nasal ridge 90% Freckling 90% Gait disturbance 90% Hypertonia 90% Microcephaly 90% Narrow nasal bridge 90% Neurological speech impairment 90% Prominent nasal bridge 90% Ptosis 90% Reduced bone mineral density 90% Scoliosis 90% Short philtrum 90% Thin skin 90% Abnormality of the nipple 50% Abnormality of the pinna 50% Delayed skeletal maturation 50% Glaucoma 50% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 50% Microcornea 50% Optic atrophy 50% Seizures 50% Short stature 50% Absent eyebrow 2/2 Absent eyelashes 2/2 Convex nasal ridge 2/2 Glaucoma 2/2 Microcephaly 2/2 Progressive spastic quadriplegia 2/2 Short nose 2/2 Encephalocele 1/2 Autosomal recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
