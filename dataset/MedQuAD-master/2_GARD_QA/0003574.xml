			<Question qid="0003574-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter ?</Question>
			<Answer>Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is a progressive disorder that mainly affects the central nervous system (CNS). This disorder causes deterioration of white matter, which consists of nerve fibers covered by myelin (the substance that protects the nerves). Most affected people begin to have signs and symptoms during childhood, but symptoms may first become apparent anywhere from before birth to adulthood. Symptoms may include difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia); muscle stiffness (spasticity); and optic atrophy. Symptoms may worsen rapidly with episodes of fever, after head trauma, or with other stresses on the body. This disorder may be caused by mutations in any of 5 genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There is no specific treatment, and prognosis seems to correlate with the age of onset, the earliest forms being more severe.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003574-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Juvenile onset 33% Macrocephaly 33% Blindness 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cerebral hypomyelination - Cessation of head growth - CNS demyelination - Decreased serum progesterone - Delusions - Developmental regression - Dysarthria - Emotional lability - Lethargy - Leukoencephalopathy - Memory impairment - Muscular hypotonia - Optic atrophy - Personality changes - Premature ovarian failure - Primary gonadal insufficiency - Secondary amenorrhea - Seizures - Spasticity - Unsteady gait - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003574-3" qtype="causes">What causes Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter ?</Question>
			<Answer>What causes leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter? Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is a genetic condition caused by mutations in any of 5 genes - EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4, and EIF2B5. These genes give the body instructions to make the five parts (subunits) of a protein called eIF2B. This protein helps regulate overall production of protein in cells (protein synthesis). Proper regulation of protein synthesis ensures that the correct levels of protein are available for cells to cope with changing conditions and stress. Mutations in any of these 5 genes results in partial loss of eIF2B function, making it more difficult for cells to regulate protein synthesis and deal with changing conditions and stress. Researchers believe that cells in the white matter may be particularly affected by an abnormal response to stress, thus causing the signs and symptoms of this condition. Approximately 90% of affected people have been found to have mutations in one of these 5 genes. Approximately 10% of families who have been diagnosed by MRI and clinical features do not have an identifiable mutation, suggesting that additional genes may also be responsible for the condition.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003574-4" qtype="inheritance">Is Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter inherited ?</Question>
			<Answer>How is leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter inherited? Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene to be affected. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003574-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter ?</Question>
			<Answer>How might leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter be treated? Treatment for leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is supportive, aiming to alleviate symptoms. Management may include physical therapy and rehabilitation for motor dysfunction (mainly spasticity and ataxia); and anti-seizure medications for seizures. Infections and fevers should be prevented when possible through the use of vaccinations; low-dose maintenance antibiotics during winter months; antibiotics for minor infections; and antipyretics (fever-reducing medications) for fever. For children, wearing a helmet outside can help minimize the effects of head trauma. Contact sports, head trauma, and stressful situations (including high body temperature) should be avoided. More detailed information about the management of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is available on the GeneReviews Web site.</Answer>
