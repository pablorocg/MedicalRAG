			<Question qid="0003284-1" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of IVIC syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of IVIC syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for IVIC syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Hearing impairment 90% Limitation of joint mobility 90% Short stature 90% Strabismus 90% Abnormal dermatoglyphics 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the thumb 50% Radioulnar synostosis 50% Scoliosis 50% Synostosis of carpal bones 50% Triphalangeal thumb 50% Abnormality of the clavicle 7.5% Arrhythmia 7.5% Leukocytosis 7.5% Preaxial hand polydactyly 7.5% Thrombocytopenia 7.5% Urogenital fistula 7.5% Absent thumb - Anal atresia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Carpal bone hypoplasia - Carpal synostosis - External ophthalmoplegia - Hypoplasia of deltoid muscle - Hypoplasia of the radius - Intestinal malrotation - Limited elbow movement - Limited interphalangeal movement - Limited wrist movement - Pectoralis major hypoplasia - Phenotypic variability - Rectovaginal fistula - Short 1st metacarpal - Small thenar eminence - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
