			<Question qid="0001784-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a progressive brain disorder that causes involuntary movements; mental and emotional problems; and a decline in thinking ability. The average age of onset of DRPLA is 30 years, but the condition can appear anytime from infancy to mid-adulthood. Specific signs and symptoms may differ among affected individuals and sometimes affects children and adults differently. DRPLA is caused by a mutation in the ATN1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001784-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy? The signs and symptoms of DRPLA differ somewhat between affected children and adults. When DRPLA appears before age 20, it most often involves episodes of involuntary muscle jerking or twitching (myoclonus); seizures; behavioral changes; intellectual disability; and problems with balance and coordination (ataxia). Epileptic seizures occur in all individuals with onset before 20 years of age. When DRPLA begins after age 20, the most frequent signs and symptoms are ataxia; uncontrollable movements of the limbs (choreoathetosis); psychiatric symptoms such as delusions; and deterioration of intellectual function (dementia). Seizures are less frequent in individuals with onset between the ages of 20 and 40. Seizures are rare in individuals with onset after age 40. Individuals who have inherited the condition from an affected parent typically have symptoms 26 to 29 years earlier than affected fathers, and 14 to 15 years earlier than affected mothers. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Atrophy of the dentate nucleus 90% Fetal cystic hygroma 90% Ataxia 25/25 Dementia 14/25 Seizures 12/25 Nystagmus 9/25 Chorea 7/25 Myoclonus 6/25 Abnormal pyramidal signs 5/25 Autosomal dominant inheritance - Choreoathetosis - Genetic anticipation - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001784-3" qtype="causes">What causes Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>What causes dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)? DRPLA is caused by a mutation in the ATN1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called atrophin 1. Although the function of atrophin 1 is unclear, it likely plays an important role in nerve cells (neurons) in many areas of the brain. The ATN1 mutation that causes DRPLA involves a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row on the gene. Normally, this CAG segment is repeated 6 to 35 times within the ATN1 gene. In people with DRPLA, the CAG segment is repeated at least 48 times (and sometimes much more). The abnormally long CAG trinucleotide repeat changes the structure of the atrophin 1 protein, which then accumulates in neurons and interferes with normal cell functions. The dysfunction and eventual death of these neurons lead to the signs and symptoms associated with DRPLA.</Answer>

			<Answer>How might dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) be treated? There is no cure for DRPLA; treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive. Management of signs and symptoms may include:  Treatment of seizures with anti-epileptic drugs Treatment of psychiatric problems with appropriate psychotropic medications Adaptation of environment and care to the level of dementia Adaptation of educational programs for affected children.</Answer>
