			<Question qid="0005571-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Shapiro syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Shapiro syndrome is a rare disease affecting about 50 people worldwide that is typically characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive sweating and hypothermia and the agenesis of the corpus callosum. The duration and frequency of the episodes vary from person to person, with some episodes lasting hours to weeks and occurring from hours to years; the reason for the variations in the episodes is not yet known. The cause of the condition is currently unknown; however, a &quot;resetting&quot; of the temperature of the body to a lower level has been suggested. Although different treatment options have been attempted in some patients, the treatments have been unsuccessful or of doubtful efficacy because of the small number of individuals that have been documented as having this condition.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0005571-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Shapiro syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Shapiro syndrome? Shapiro syndrome generally consists of three findings: spontaneous periodic hypothermia, excessive sweating, and agenesis of the corpus callosum. However, there has been a documented case of a 4-year-old girl with Shapiro syndrome who did not have agenesis of the corpus callosum. Additionally, there have been some patients who also produce excessive amounts of urine  (polyuria) and have experienced excessive thirst (polydipsia).  Given that some people with Shapiro syndrome do not respond well to the various treatment options available for the condition, the symptoms may worsen with time for some people.   The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Shapiro syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Gait disturbance 90% Hyperhidrosis 90% Hypothermia 90% Incoordination 90% Nausea and vomiting 90% Pallor 90% Arrhythmia 50% Reduced consciousness/confusion 50% Seizures 50% Sleep disturbance 50% Tremor 50% Abnormal pattern of respiration 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum 7.5% Diarrhea 7.5% Skin rash 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0005571-3" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Shapiro syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What treatment options have been attempted for Shapiro syndrome? Evaluating effective treatment options for Shapiro syndrome can be difficult because of the limited number of diagnosed cases, the periodic nature of the disease, and other factors. Nonetheless, the following have been attempted and have resulted in varying responses: anticonvulsants, clonidine, cyproheptadine, glycopyrrolate, bromocriptine, chlorpromazine, or sympathectomy. It is recommended that treatment options be discussed with a health care provider. Only a patient&apos;s health care provider can determine the appropriate course of treatment.</Answer>
