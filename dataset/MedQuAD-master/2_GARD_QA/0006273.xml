			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Ulnar-mammary syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Ulnar-mammary syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal hair quantity 90% Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Hypohidrosis 90% Split hand 90% Abnormality of female internal genitalia 50% Abnormality of the wrist 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the nipples 50% Cryptorchidism 50% Decreased fertility 50% Hypoplasia of penis 50% Obesity 50% Short stature 50% Abnormality of the humerus 7.5% Abnormality of the metacarpal bones 7.5% Absent hand 7.5% Aplasia of the pectoralis major muscle 7.5% Arrhythmia 7.5% Breast aplasia 7.5% Camptodactyly of finger 7.5% Ectopic anus 7.5% Hernia of the abdominal wall 7.5% Hypoplastic toenails 7.5% Laryngomalacia 7.5% Pectus carinatum 7.5% Postaxial hand polydactyly 7.5% Pyloric stenosis 7.5% Reduced number of teeth 7.5% Renal hypoplasia/aplasia 7.5% Short distal phalanx of finger 7.5% Sprengel anomaly 7.5% Urogenital fistula 7.5% Ventricular septal defect 7.5% Absent radius - Absent ulna - Anal atresia - Anal stenosis - Anterior pituitary hypoplasia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Axillary apocrine gland hypoplasia - Breast hypoplasia - Deformed radius - Delayed puberty - Ectopic posterior pituitary - Hypodontia - Hypoplasia of the radius - Hypoplasia of the ulna - Hypoplastic nipples - Hypoplastic scapulae - Imperforate hymen - Inguinal hernia - Inverted nipples - Micropenis - Shawl scrotum - Short 4th toe - Short 5th toe - Short clavicles - Short humerus - Sparse axillary hair - Sparse lateral eyebrow - Subglottic stenosis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
