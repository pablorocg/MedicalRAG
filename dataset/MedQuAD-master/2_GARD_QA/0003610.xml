			<Question qid="0003610-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2C ?</Question>
			<Answer>Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C (LGMD2C) is a condition that affects the muscles and is caused by mutations in the gamma-sarcoglycan gene. This condition belongs to a group of muscle disorders called limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, which are characterized by progressive loss of muscle bulk and symmetrical weakening of voluntary muscles, primarily those in the shoulders and around the hips. LGMD2C is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and treatment is based on an individual&apos;s symptoms.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003610-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2C ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2C? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2C. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Calf muscle pseudohypertrophy - Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase - Flexion contracture - Gowers sign - Hyperlordosis - Muscle fiber necrosis - Muscular dystrophy - Pneumonia - Rapidly progressive - Restrictive lung disease - Right ventricular dilatation - Right ventricular hypertrophy - Scoliosis - Skeletal muscle atrophy - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003610-3" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, type 2C ?</Question>
			<Answer>What treatment is available for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy? There is no specific treatment for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Management of the condition is based on the person&apos;s symptoms and subtype (if known). The GeneReview article on limb-girdle muscular dystrophy lists the following approach for medical management of the condition: Weight control to avoid obesity Physical therapy and stretching exercises to promote mobility and prevent contractures Use of mechanical aids such as canes, walkers, orthotics, and wheelchairs as needed to help ambulation and mobility Monitoring and surgical intervention as needed for orthopedic complications such as foot deformity and scoliosis Monitoring of respiratory function and use of respiratory aids when indicated Monitoring for evidence of cardiomyopathy in those subtypes with known occurrence of cardiac involvement Social and emotional support and stimulation to maximize a sense of social involvement and productivity and to reduce the sense of social isolation common in these disorders</Answer>
