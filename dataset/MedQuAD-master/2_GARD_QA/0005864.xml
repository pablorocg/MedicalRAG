			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Spranger Schinzel Myers syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Spranger Schinzel Myers syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Ablepharon - Absent eyelashes - Agenesis of corpus callosum - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bifid uterus - Calcaneovalgus deformity - Camptodactyly - Cataract - Cerebellar hypoplasia - Choroid plexus cyst - Cleft palate - Cleft upper lip - Clinodactyly - Cryptorchidism - Dandy-Walker malformation - Decreased fetal movement - Finger syndactyly - Generalized edema - Hydranencephaly - Hypertelorism - Intrauterine growth retardation - Joint contracture of the hand - Lissencephaly - Macrotia - Microcephaly - Micromelia - Microphthalmia - Patent ductus arteriosus - Patent foramen ovale - Polyhydramnios - Proptosis - Pterygium - Pulmonary hypoplasia - Radial deviation of finger - Renal agenesis - Rocker bottom foot - Short neck - Short umbilical cord - Sloping forehead - Small placenta - Spina bifida - Stillbirth - Thick lower lip vermilion - Toe syndactyly - Transposition of the great arteries - Ventricular septal defect - Yellow subcutaneous tissue covered by thin, scaly skin - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
