			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Gollop Coates syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Gollop Coates syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Broad forehead 33% Highly arched eyebrow 33% Long philtrum 33% Sparse eyebrow 33% Aortic regurgitation - Aortic valve stenosis - Arthralgia - Arthropathy - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Barrel-shaped chest - Bilateral single transverse palmar creases - Brachydactyly syndrome - Camptodactyly of finger - Coronal cleft vertebrae - Cubitus valgus - Decreased hip abduction - Delayed eruption of teeth - Delayed gross motor development - Delayed skeletal maturation - Deviation of the 5th finger - Elbow dislocation - Fixed elbow flexion - Flattened epiphysis - Generalized bone demineralization - Genu valgum - Hearing impairment - High palate - Hypertelorism - Hypoplasia of the capital femoral epiphysis - Hypoplasia of the ulna - Intervertebral space narrowing - Irregular vertebral endplates - Knee dislocation - Kyphoscoliosis - Limited hip extension - Lumbar hyperlordosis - Microdontia - Microtia - Mitral regurgitation - Mitral stenosis - Multiple carpal ossification centers - Narrow vertebral interpedicular distance - Pes planus - Pulmonary hypertension - Pulmonic stenosis - Rhizomelia - Short distal phalanx of finger - Short femoral neck - Short metacarpal - Short neck - Short phalanx of finger - Shoulder dislocation - Small epiphyses - Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia - Talipes equinovarus - Tibial bowing - Tricuspid regurgitation - Tricuspid stenosis - Ulnar bowing - Ventricular hypertrophy - Ventricular septal defect - Waddling gait - Wide intermamillary distance - Widely spaced teeth - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
