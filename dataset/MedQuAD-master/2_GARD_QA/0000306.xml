			<Question qid="0000306-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Amyopathic dermatomyositis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Amyopathic dermatomyositis is a form of dermatomyositis characterized by the presence of typical skin findings without muscle weakness. Some of the skin changes that suggest dermatomyositis include a pink rash on the face, neck, forearms and upper chest; Gottron&apos;s papules and heliotrope eyelids. Pruritis and photosensitivity are common, as is scalp inflammation and thinning of the hair. While patients with amyopathic dermatomyositis should not have clinically evident muscle weakness, minor muscle abnormalities may be included. Fatigue is reported in at least 50% of patients. Some cases have been associated with internal malignancy and/or interstitial lung disease. Treatment may include sun avoidance, ample use of sunscreen, topical corticosteroids, antimalarial agents, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, or intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000306-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Amyopathic dermatomyositis ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Amyopathic dermatomyositis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Amyopathic dermatomyositis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the eye 90% Autoimmunity 90% EMG abnormality 90% Muscle weakness 90% Myalgia 90% Periorbital edema 90% Abnormal hair quantity 50% Abnormality of the nail 50% Acrocyanosis 50% Arthralgia 50% Arthritis 50% Chondrocalcinosis 50% Dry skin 50% Muscular hypotonia 50% Poikiloderma 50% Pruritus 50% Pulmonary fibrosis 50% Recurrent respiratory infections 50% Respiratory insufficiency 50% Restrictive lung disease 50% Skin ulcer 50% Weight loss 50% Abnormality of eosinophils 7.5% Abnormality of temperature regulation 7.5% Abnormality of the myocardium 7.5% Abnormality of the pericardium 7.5% Abnormality of the voice 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the skin 7.5% Arrhythmia 7.5% Cellulitis 7.5% Coronary artery disease 7.5% Cutaneous photosensitivity 7.5% Feeding difficulties in infancy 7.5% Gangrene 7.5% Gastrointestinal stroma tumor 7.5% Lymphoma 7.5% Neoplasm of the breast 7.5% Neoplasm of the lung 7.5% Neurological speech impairment 7.5% Ovarian neoplasm 7.5% Pulmonary hypertension 7.5% Telangiectasia of the skin 7.5% Vasculitis 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
