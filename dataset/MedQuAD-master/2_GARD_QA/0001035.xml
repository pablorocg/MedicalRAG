There are three main forms of the condition that are differentiated by their pattern of inheritance: X-linked Myotubular Myopathy Autosomal Dominant Centronuclear Myopathy Autosomal Recessive Centronuclear Myopathy The cause of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary by subtype. For more information, click on the link of interest above.

			<Question qid="0001035-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Centronuclear myopathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Centronuclear myopathy? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Centronuclear myopathy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) EMG abnormality 90% Gait disturbance 90% Muscular hypotonia 90% Skeletal muscle atrophy 90% Arrhythmia 50% Mask-like facies 50% Ophthalmoparesis 50% Ptosis 50% Respiratory insufficiency 50% Scoliosis 50% Seizures 50% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
