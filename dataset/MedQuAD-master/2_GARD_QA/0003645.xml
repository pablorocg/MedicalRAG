			<Answer>Littoral cell angioma (LCA)  is a vascular tumor of the spleen. A vascular tumor is an overgrowth of blood vessels. The condition was first described in 1991. In many cases, LCA does not produce any symptoms and is found when tests are being performed for other reasons (an incidental finding). However, in some cases, individuals with LCA have an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), abdominal pain, fever, and portal hypertension (increased pressure in the vein that carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver). Though most reported cases of LCA have been benign, some reports have associated LCA with various other conditions including Crohn&apos;s disease, Gaucher disease, lymphoma, aplastic anemia, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and myelodysplastic syndrome. In rare cases, the LCA itself can become cancerous. The treatment of choice is usually removal of the spleen (splenectomy).</Answer>
