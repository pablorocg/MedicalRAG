			<Question qid="0001690-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Cushing disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cushing disease is a condition caused by elevated levels of a hormone called cortisol. It is part of a group of diseases known as Cushings syndrome. The signs and symptoms include weight gain around the trunk and in the face, stretch marks, easy bruising, a hump on the upper back, muscle weakness, tiredness, thin bones that are prone to fracture (osteoporosis), mood disorders and memory problems. Patients also have an increased risk of infections, high blood pressure and diabetes. Women may have irregular menses and a lot of hair in the body (hirsutism). Cushing disease occurs when a benign pituitary tumor (adenoma) or pituitary hyperplasia causes the adrenal glands to produce large amounts of cortisol. The genetic cause of Cushing disease is often unknown but some cases are caused by somatic mutations in genes involved in hormonal activity. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Rarely, Cushing disease can be inherited, either as an isolated condition or as part of a genetic syndrome (such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and familial isolated pituitary adenoma). Treatment generally involves surgery to remove the tumor and medications to decrease cortisol levels.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001690-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Cushing disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Cushing disease? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Cushing disease. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of adipose tissue 90% Hypercortisolism 90% Neoplasm of the endocrine system 90% Round face 90% Thin skin 90% Truncal obesity 90% Acne 50% Bruising susceptibility 50% Decreased fertility 50% Diabetes mellitus 50% Hypertension 50% Hypertrichosis 50% Hypokalemia 50% Nephrolithiasis 50% Recurrent fractures 50% Reduced bone mineral density 50% Abdominal pain 7.5% Abnormality of the gastric mucosa 7.5% Aseptic necrosis 7.5% Cataract 7.5% Generalized hyperpigmentation 7.5% Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 7.5% Migraine 7.5% Myopathy 7.5% Paronychia 7.5% Reduced consciousness/confusion 7.5% Secondary amenorrhea 7.5% Skin ulcer 7.5% Sleep disturbance 7.5% Telangiectasia of the skin 7.5% Thrombophlebitis 7.5% Visual impairment 7.5% Abdominal obesity - Abnormal fear/anxiety-related behavior - Alkalosis - Biconcave vertebral bodies - Edema - Facial erythema - Glucose intolerance - Hirsutism - Increased circulating ACTH level - Kyphosis - Mood changes - Oligomenorrhea - Osteoporosis - Pituitary adenoma - Poor wound healing - Psychotic mentation - Purpura - Skeletal muscle atrophy - Striae distensae - Vertebral compression fractures - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
