			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Arachnodactyly - intellectual disability - dysmorphism? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Arachnodactyly - intellectual disability - dysmorphism. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Arachnodactyly 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Decreased body weight 90% Long face 90% Long toe 90% Narrow face 90% Thin vermilion border 90% Trismus 90% Abnormality of calvarial morphology 50% Abnormality of immune system physiology 50% Abnormality of the genital system 50% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 50% Hypertelorism 50% Hypertonia 50% Joint hypermobility 50% Long philtrum 50% Microcephaly 50% Narrow mouth 50% Pointed chin 50% Strabismus 50% Triphalangeal thumb 50% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
