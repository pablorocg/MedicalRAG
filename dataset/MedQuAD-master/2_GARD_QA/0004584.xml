			<Question qid="0004584-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Orofaciodigital syndrome 1 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Orofaciodigital syndrome 1 (OFD1), also called orofaciodigital syndrome type 1, is a condition that affects the development of the oral cavity (the mouth and teeth), facial features, and digits (fingers and toes). This condition also causes polycystic kidney disease. Orofaciodigital syndrome 1 is caused by a change (mutation) in a gene called OFD1 which appears to play an important role in the early development of many parts of the body including the brain, face, limbs, and kidneys. The syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. The diagnosis of OFD1 is sometimes made at birth, but it may be suspected only after polycystic kidney disease is found in later childhood or adulthood. Treatment for OFD1 typically focuses on the symptoms an individual has and may include surgery for cleft lip or palate , other oral abnormalities, or syndactyly (webbing of the fingers or toes). Researchers have identified at least 13 potential forms of orofaciodigital syndromes, which are classified by their patterns of signs and symptoms. OFD1 is the most common form of orofaciodigital syndrome and differs from the other types mainly by its association with polycystic kidney disease.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004584-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Orofaciodigital syndrome 1 ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Orofaciodigital syndrome 1? Oral features of OFD1 may include a split (lobed) tongue, benign tumors of the tongue, cleft palate, hypodontia (missing teeth), or other dental abnormalities. Facial features may include hypertelorism (increased width between the eyes), a small nose, micrognathia (small jaw) and other features. The fingers and toes may be short (brachydactyly), webbed or joined together (syndactyly), abnormally curved (clinodactyly), or have other abnormalities. There may be brain abnormalities (such as cysts) and kidney problems (such as polycystic kidney disease). About half of individuals with OFD1 have some degree of learning disability, which is usually mild. Almost all individuals with OFD1 are female. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Orofaciodigital syndrome 1. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Bifid tongue 90% Broad alveolar ridges 90% Cleft upper lip 90% Frontal bossing 90% Hypertelorism 90% Wide nasal bridge 90% Abnormality of the nares 50% Cleft palate 50% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 50% Cognitive impairment 50% Cone-shaped epiphysis 50% Facial asymmetry 50% Finger syndactyly 50% Foot polydactyly 50% Incoordination 50% Reduced bone mineral density 50% Reduced number of teeth 50% Seizures 50% Short toe 50% Underdeveloped nasal alae 50% Pancreatic cysts 29% Abnormality of dental enamel 7.5% Alopecia 7.5% Aneurysm 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum 7.5% Brachydactyly syndrome 7.5% Choanal atresia 7.5% Coarse hair 7.5% Cystic liver disease 7.5% Dandy-Walker malformation 7.5% Dental malocclusion 7.5% Dry skin 7.5% Elevated hepatic transaminases 7.5% Epicanthus 7.5% Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency 7.5% Hearing impairment 7.5% Hypertension 7.5% Hypoplasia of the zygomatic bone 7.5% Lip pit 7.5% Multicystic kidney dysplasia 7.5% Odontogenic neoplasm 7.5% Otitis media 7.5% Postaxial hand polydactyly 7.5% Preaxial hand polydactyly 7.5% Proteinuria 7.5% Renal insufficiency 7.5% Tarsal synostosis 7.5% Telecanthus 7.5% Tremor 7.5% Myelomeningocele 5% Abnormal cortical gyration - Abnormal heart morphology - Abnormality of the cerebellum - Abnormality of toe - Agenesis of corpus callosum - Agenesis of permanent teeth - Alveolar ridge overgrowth - Arachnoid cyst - Carious teeth - Clinodactyly - Congenital onset - Gray matter heterotopias - Hepatic cysts - Hepatic fibrosis - High palate - Hydrocephalus - Hypoplasia of dental enamel - Hypothalamic hamartoma - Increased number of teeth - Intellectual disability - Lobulated tongue - Low-set ears - Median cleft lip - Microcephaly - Microretrognathia - Milia - Ovarian cyst - Polycystic kidney dysplasia - Polydactyly - Porencephaly - Radial deviation of finger - Short stature - Sparse hair - Syndactyly - Tongue nodules - X-linked dominant inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004584-3" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Orofaciodigital syndrome 1 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Is genetic testing available for orofaciodigital syndrome 1 (OFD1)? Genetic testing for orofaciodigital syndrome 1 is clinically available. OFD1  is the only gene currently known to be associated with this condition. Testing is often used to confirm or establish the diagnosis in an individual when OFD1 is suspected.  A change (mutation) in the OFD1 gene is detected in up to 85% of individuals who have OFD1.  You can find laboratories offering clinical genetic testing for OFD1 on a website called GeneTests. To see a listing of clinical testing laboratories click here. GeneTests does not currently list laboratories doing research testing for OFD1.</Answer>
