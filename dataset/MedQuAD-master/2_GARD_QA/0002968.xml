			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Hydrolethalus syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hydrolethalus syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Polyhydramnios 92% Severe hydrocephalus 92% Microphthalmia 86% Postaxial hand polydactyly 77% Cleft in skull base 76% Stillbirth 73% Abnormality of the pinna 70% Low-set ears 70% Abnormal lung lobation 66% Laryngeal hypoplasia 57% Tracheal stenosis 57% Cleft palate 55% Talipes equinovarus 52% Complete atrioventricular canal defect 48% Duplication of phalanx of hallux 47% Bifid uterus 33% Hypospadias 33% Upper limb undergrowth 24% Hydronephrosis 16% Abnormal cortical gyration - Abnormality of the vagina - Absent septum pellucidum - Accessory spleen - Adrenal gland dysgenesis - Agenesis of corpus callosum - Agenesis of the diaphragm - Arrhinencephaly - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bifid nose - Broad neck - Dandy-Walker malformation - Heterotopia - Intrauterine growth retardation - Median cleft lip - Omphalocele - Preaxial hand polydactyly - Proximal tibial hypoplasia - Ventricular septal defect - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
