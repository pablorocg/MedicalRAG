			<Question qid="0000963-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Carney complex ?</Question>
			<Answer>Carney complex is an inherited condition characterized by spotty skin pigmentation, cardiac (heart) myxomas (tumors composed of mucous connective tissue), skin myxomas, endocrine tumors or over-activity, and schwannomas. Some families with this condition have been found to have mutations in the PRKAR1A gene. Carney complex is believed to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000963-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Carney complex ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Carney complex? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Carney complex. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal pigmentation of the oral mucosa 90% Growth hormone excess 90% Gynecomastia 90% Hypercortisolism 90% Melanocytic nevus 90% Neoplasm of the adrenal gland 90% Neoplasm of the heart 90% Neoplasm of the skin 90% Neoplasm of the thyroid gland 90% Testicular neoplasm 90% Abnormality of adipose tissue 50% Abnormality of temperature regulation 50% Arthralgia 50% Behavioral abnormality 50% Broad foot 50% Cerebral ischemia 50% Coarse facial features 50% Congestive heart failure 50% Hypertension 50% Hypertrichosis 50% Joint swelling 50% Kyphosis 50% Large hands 50% Neoplasm of the breast 50% Osteoarthritis 50% Reduced bone mineral density 50% Round face 50% Skeletal muscle atrophy 50% Thin skin 50% Truncal obesity 50% Type II diabetes mellitus 50% Anemia 7.5% Cognitive impairment 7.5% Cryptorchidism 7.5% Mitral stenosis 7.5% Neoplasm of the nervous system 7.5% Ovarian neoplasm 7.5% Precocious puberty 7.5% Striae distensae 7.5% Sudden cardiac death 7.5% Tall stature 7.5% Weight loss 7.5% Abnormality of the eye - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Freckling - Hirsutism - Myxoid subcutaneous tumors - Nevus - Pheochromocytoma - Pituitary adenoma - Profuse pigmented skin lesions - Red hair - Schwannoma - Thyroid carcinoma - Thyroid follicular hyperplasia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
