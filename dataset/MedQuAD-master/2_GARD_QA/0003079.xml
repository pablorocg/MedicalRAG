			<Question qid="0003079-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Hypopituitarism ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hypopituitarism occurs when the body has low levels of certain hormones made by the pituitary gland.  The pituitary gland normally makes several hormones (including growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, vasopressin, and oxytocin).  These hormones are important for directing body growth and development, and for regulating blood pressure and metabolism.  Symptoms of this condition vary and depend on which hormones are affected.  Treatment depends on the cause of this condition; once the cause is corrected, medication (hormone replacement therapy) must be taken to provide the body with the normal amount of hormones.</Answer>
