			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Chondrodysplasia, Grebe type? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Chondrodysplasia, Grebe type. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the metacarpal bones 90% Adactyly 90% Bowing of the long bones 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Limitation of joint mobility 90% Micromelia 90% Short stature 90% Short toe 90% Skeletal dysplasia 90% Synostosis of carpal bones 90% Tarsal synostosis 90% Abnormality of the fibula 50% Abnormality of the tibia 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the thumb 50% Postaxial hand polydactyly 50% Acromesomelia - Aplasia/Hypoplasia involving the metacarpal bones - Aplasia/Hypoplasia of metatarsal bones - Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the patella - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Death in infancy - Disproportionate short-limb short stature - Fibular hypoplasia - Flexion contracture - Hypoplasia of the radius - Hypoplasia of the ulna - Short digit - Short femur - Short foot - Short humerus - Short phalanx of finger - Short tibia - Stillbirth - Valgus foot deformity - Valgus hand deformity - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
