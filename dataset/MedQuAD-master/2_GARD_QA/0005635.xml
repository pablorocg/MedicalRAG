			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Simosa cranio facial syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Simosa cranio facial syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the antihelix 90% Abnormality of the antitragus 90% Abnormality of the palate 90% Abnormality of the tragus 90% Abnormality of the voice 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the earlobes 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the eyebrow 90% Blepharophimosis 90% Broad forehead 90% Chin dimple 90% Downturned corners of mouth 90% High forehead 90% Highly arched eyebrow 90% Hypoplasia of the zygomatic bone 90% Long face 90% Long philtrum 90% Macrotia 90% Malar flattening 90% Narrow mouth 90% Telecanthus 90% Underdeveloped nasal alae 90% Wide nasal bridge 90% Cryptorchidism 50% Hernia of the abdominal wall 50% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 50% Scoliosis 50% Scrotal hypoplasia 50% Camptodactyly of finger 7.5% Abnormality of the pinna 2/2 Abnormality of the skin 2/2 Blepharophimosis 2/2 Broad forehead 2/2 Depressed nasal tip 2/2 High, narrow palate 2/2 Highly arched eyebrow 2/2 Inguinal hernia 2/2 Long face 2/2 Long nose 2/2 Long philtrum 2/2 Low-set ears 2/2 Malar flattening 2/2 Narrow mouth 2/2 Nasal speech 2/2 Posteriorly rotated ears 2/2 Sparse eyebrow 2/2 Telecanthus 2/2 Underdeveloped nasal alae 2/2 Wide nasal bridge 2/2 Autosomal dominant inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
