			<Question qid="0003457-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Laing distal myopathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>Laing distal myopathy is a slowly progressive muscle disorder that tends to begin in childhood.   Early symptoms include weakness in the feet and ankles, followed by weakness in the hands and wrists. Weakness in the feet leads to tightening of the Achilles tendon, an inability to lift the big toe, and a high-stepping walk.  Weakness in the hands makes it more difficult to lift the fingers, especially the third and fourth fingers. As the muscle weakness slowly progresses over the course of many years, other muscles of the body (e.g., neck, face, legs, hips, and shoulders) weaken. Most affected people remain mobile throughout life. Life expectancy is normal. Laing distal myopathy is caused by mutations in the MYH7 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003457-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Laing distal myopathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Laing distal myopathy? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Laing distal myopathy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Dilated cardiomyopathy 7.5% Proximal muscle weakness 7.5% Amyotrophy of ankle musculature - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Childhood onset - Distal muscle weakness - Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase - EMG: neuropathic changes - Facial palsy - Gait disturbance - High palate - Infantile onset - Mildly elevated creatine phosphokinase - Myalgia - Neck muscle weakness - Pes cavus - Phenotypic variability - Ragged-red muscle fibers - Scoliosis - Slow progression - Toe extensor amyotrophy - Type 1 muscle fiber predominance - Weakness of long finger extensor muscles - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
