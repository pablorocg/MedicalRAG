			<Question qid="0001930-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Duane syndrome type 3 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Duane syndrome type 3 is a disorder of eye movement. The affected eye, or eyes, has limited ability to move both inward toward the nose and outward toward the ears. The eye opening narrows and the eyeball pulls in when looking inward toward the nose. About 15 percent of all cases of Duane syndrome are type 3. Most cases occur without other signs and symptoms. In most people with Duane syndrome type 3, the cause is unknown; but it can sometimes be caused by mutations in the CHN1 gene and inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001930-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Duane syndrome type 3 ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Duane syndrome type 3? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Duane syndrome type 3. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Ophthalmoparesis 90% Strabismus 90% Anteverted nares 50% Blepharophimosis 50% Deeply set eye 50% Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 7.5% Abnormal localization of kidney 7.5% Abnormality of the pupil 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the iris 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the radius 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the thumb 7.5% Brachydactyly syndrome 7.5% Chorioretinal coloboma 7.5% Cleft palate 7.5% Cognitive impairment 7.5% External ear malformation 7.5% Hearing impairment 7.5% Heterochromia iridis 7.5% Microcephaly 7.5% Nystagmus 7.5% Optic atrophy 7.5% Ptosis 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Short neck 7.5% Talipes 7.5% Visual impairment 7.5% Wide nasal bridge 7.5% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Congenital strabismus - Duane anomaly - Impaired convergence - Impaired ocular abduction - Impaired ocular adduction - Palpebral fissure narrowing on adduction - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
