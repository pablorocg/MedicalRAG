			<Answer>Childhood ovarian cancer is a rare type of cancer that occurs due to abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth in the ovaries. The childhood form, specifically, is extremely rare and accounts for less than 5% of all ovarian cancer cases. The most common types of ovarian cancers diagnosed in children and adolescents include germ cell tumors, followed by epithelial tumors, stromal tumors, and then other tumors (such as Burkitt lymphoma and small cell carcinoma of the ovary). Many people with early ovarian cancer have no signs or symptoms of the condition. When present, symptoms may include painful menstrual periods; an abdominal lump; pain or swelling in the abdomen; having male sex traits (i.e. body hair or a deep voice); and/or early signs of puberty. The underlying cause of childhood ovarian cancer is often unknown. Certain inherited conditions, such as Ollier disease, Maffucci syndrome and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are associated with an increased risk of developing childhood ovarian cancer. Treatment varies based on many factors including the type of ovarian tumor and the severity of the condition. It may include surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy.</Answer>
