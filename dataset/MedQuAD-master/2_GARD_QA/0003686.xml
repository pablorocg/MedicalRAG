			<Question qid="0003686-1" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Lung agenesis ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Lung agenesis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lung agenesis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Respiratory insufficiency 90% Abnormal lung lobation 50% Abnormality of the aorta 50% Anomalous pulmonary venous return 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the lungs 50% Atria septal defect 50% Patent ductus arteriosus 50% Abnormality of the aortic valve 7.5% Abnormality of the helix 7.5% Abnormality of the ribs 7.5% Abnormality of the tricuspid valve 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the thumb 7.5% Complete atrioventricular canal defect 7.5% Congenital diaphragmatic hernia 7.5% Preaxial hand polydactyly 7.5% Proximal placement of thumb 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Short distal phalanx of finger 7.5% Single transverse palmar crease 7.5% Spina bifida 7.5% Triphalangeal thumb 7.5% Ventriculomegaly 7.5% Vertebral segmentation defect 7.5% Abnormality of the cardiac septa - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bilateral lung agenesis - Coarctation of aorta - Congenital onset - Neonatal death - Tracheal atresia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
