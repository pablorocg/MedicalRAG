			<Question qid="0004377-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Neurogenic diabetes insipidus ?</Question>
			<Answer>Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is a disease that causes frequent urination. This type of diabetes insipidus results from damage to the pituitary gland, which disrupts the normal storage and release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). When this hormone reaches the kidneys, it directs them to make less urine. Damage to the pituitary gland can be caused by different diseases as well as by head injuries, neurosurgery, or genetic disorders. To treat the ADH deficiency that results from any kind of damage to the pituitary, a synthetic hormone called desmopressin can be taken by an injection, a nasal spray, or a pill.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004377-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Neurogenic diabetes insipidus ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Neurogenic diabetes insipidus? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Neurogenic diabetes insipidus. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal renal physiology 90% Dehydration 90% Diabetes insipidus 90% Weight loss 90% Abnormality of temperature regulation 50% Behavioral abnormality 50% Migraine 50% Reduced consciousness/confusion 50% Diarrhea 7.5% Hypernatremia 7.5% Hyponatremia 7.5% Nausea and vomiting 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Gliosis - Hypertelorism - Long philtrum - Osteopenia - Short nose - Wide nose - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
