			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Infantile myofibromatosis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Infantile myofibromatosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the metaphyses 90% Abnormality of the musculature 90% Bone cyst 90% Neoplasm of the skeletal system 90% Sarcoma 90% Abnormality of the skull 50% Abnormality of the thorax 50% Chondrocalcinosis 50% Gingival overgrowth 50% Neoplasm of the lung 50% Abnormality of the eye 7.5% Abnormality of the kidney 7.5% Abnormality of the sacrum 7.5% Benign neoplasm of the central nervous system 7.5% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 7.5% Hypercalcemia 7.5% Intestinal obstruction 7.5% Irregular hyperpigmentation 7.5% Limitation of joint mobility 7.5% Neoplasm of the pancreas 7.5% Osteolysis 7.5% Skin ulcer 7.5% Tracheoesophageal fistula 7.5% Abnormality of connective tissue - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Fibroma - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
