			<Question qid="0000569-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features ?</Question>
			<Answer>Autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF) is a rare form of epilepsy, a condition that is characterized by recurrent seizures. In ADPEAF, specifically, most affected people experience secondary generalized seizures and partial seizures, some of which are associated with sound-related symptoms (such as buzzing, humming, or ringing) and/or receptive aphasia (inability to understand written or spoken words). Less commonly, seizures may cause visual hallucinations, a disturbance in the sense of smell, vertigo, or other symptoms affecting the senses. Signs and symptoms of the condition generally begin in adolescence or early adulthood. ADPEAF is caused by changes (mutations) in the LGI1 or RELN gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The seizures associated with ADPEAF are typically well controlled with medications that are used to treat epilepsy (called antiepileptic drugs).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000569-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Auditory auras - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Bilateral convulsive seizures - Focal seizures with impairment of consciousness or awareness - Focal seizures without impairment of consciousness or awareness - Incomplete penetrance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
