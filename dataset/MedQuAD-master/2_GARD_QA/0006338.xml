			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Ventricular extrasystoles with syncopal episodes - perodactyly - Robin sequence? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Ventricular extrasystoles with syncopal episodes - perodactyly - Robin sequence. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the nose 90% Arrhythmia 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Short distal phalanx of finger 90% Short stature 90% Short toe 90% Tapered finger 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the distal phalanges of the toes 50% Cleft palate 50% Low anterior hairline 50% Reduced number of teeth 50% Abnormality of the metacarpal bones 7.5% Camptodactyly of finger 7.5% Cognitive impairment 7.5% Glossoptosis 7.5% Microcephaly 7.5% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Pierre-Robin sequence - Posteriorly placed tongue - Submucous cleft hard palate - Syncope - Tachycardia - Ventricular extrasystoles - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
