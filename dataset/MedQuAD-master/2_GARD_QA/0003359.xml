			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of calvarial morphology 90% Arachnodactyly 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Long toe 90% Microcephaly 90% Optic atrophy 90% Respiratory insufficiency 90% Upslanted palpebral fissure 90% Abnormality of the palate 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the eyebrow 50% Blepharophimosis 50% Epicanthus 50% Long face 50% Microcornea 50% Microdontia 50% Muscle weakness 50% Myopia 50% Narrow face 50% Nystagmus 50% Preauricular skin tag 50% Short philtrum 50% Strabismus 50% Telecanthus 50% Thin vermilion border 50% Wide mouth 50% Choroideremia 7.5% Female pseudohermaphroditism 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bell-shaped thorax - Brachycephaly - Carious teeth - Clinodactyly of the 5th finger - Clitoromegaly - Constipation - Diastema - High palate - Intellectual disability - Laryngeal stridor - Long palm - Muscular hypotonia - Narrow palm - Neonatal respiratory distress - Optic disc pallor - Ovoid vertebral bodies - Ptosis - Short nose - Single transverse palmar crease - Smooth philtrum - Sparse eyebrow - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
