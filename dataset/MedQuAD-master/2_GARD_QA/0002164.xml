			<Question qid="0002164-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Erythropoietic protoporphyria ?</Question>
			<Answer>Erythropoietic protoporphyria is a type of porphyria. Porphyrias are caused by an abnormality in the heme production process. Heme is essential in enabling our blood cells to carry oxygen and in breaking down chemical compounds in the liver. Erythropoietic protoporphyria is caused by impaired activity of ferrocheletase (FECH), an important enzyme in heme production. This results in the build-up of protoporphyrin in the bone marrow, red blood cells, blood plasma, skin, and eventually liver. Build up of protoporphyrin can cause extreme sensitivity to sunlight, liver damage, abdominal pain, gallstones, and enlargement of the spleen.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002164-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Erythropoietic protoporphyria ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Erythropoietic protoporphyria? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Erythropoietic protoporphyria. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cutaneous photosensitivity 90% Urticaria 90% Biliary tract abnormality 7.5% Cirrhosis 7.5% Eczema 7.5% Edema 7.5% Microcytic anemia 7.5% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Childhood onset - Cholelithiasis - Erythema - Hemolytic anemia - Hepatic failure - Hypertriglyceridemia - Pruritus - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002164-3" qtype="causes">What causes Erythropoietic protoporphyria ?</Question>
			<Answer>What is the genetic basis of erythropoietic protoporphyria? Erythropoietic protoporphyria is caused by mutations in the FECH gene.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002164-4" qtype="inheritance">Is Erythropoietic protoporphyria inherited ?</Question>
			<Answer>How is erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) inherited? EPP is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In most cases, affected individuals have one severe (loss-of-function) mutation that is inherited from one parent, and another weak (low-expression) mutation that is inherited from the other parent. In a small number of cases, an affected individual has two loss-of-function mutations. When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% (1 in 4) chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier</Answer>
