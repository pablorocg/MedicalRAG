			<Question qid="0001517-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Congenital hepatic fibrosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Congenital hepatic fibrosis is a rare disease of the liver that is present at birth. Symptoms include the following: a large liver, a large spleen, gastrointestinal bleeding caused by varices, increased pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood to the liver (portal hypertension), and scar tissue in the liver (fibrosis). Isolated congenital hepatic fibrosis is rare; it usually occurs as part of a syndrome that also affects the kidneys. There is no treatment to correct the fibrosis or the specific abnormalities in the blood vessels, but complications such as bleeding and infection can be treated.</Answer>

			<Answer>What causes congenital hepatic fibrosis? Isolated congenital hepatic fibrosis is rare. Congenital hepatic fibrosis is usually associated with conditions known as hepatorenal fibrocystic diseases (FCD) that can also affect the kidneys. Examples of FCDs include polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and nephronophthisis (NPHP). FCDs can be inherited as autosomal recessive , autosomal dominant , or X-linked recessive disorders.</Answer>
