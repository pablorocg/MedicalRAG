			<Question qid="0001324-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction ?</Question>
			<Answer>Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is a rare but serious condition characterized by repetitive episodes or continuous symptoms of bowel obstruction when no blockage exists. The most common symptoms are abdominal swelling or bloating (distention), vomiting, abdominal pain, failure to thrive, diarrhea, constipation, feeding intolerance and urinary symptoms. CIPO can occur in people of any age. It may be primary or secondary. Problems with nerves, muscles, or interstitial cells of Cajal (the cells that set the pace of intestinal contractions) prevent normal contractions and cause problems with the movement of food, fluid, and air through the intestines. Primary or idiopathic (where the cause is unknown) CIPO occurs by itself. Secondary CIPO develops as a complication of another medical condition. Some people with primary CIPO have gain or loss of genetic material in the FLNA gene. The diagnosis of CIPO is clinical and other conditions with similar symptoms should be ruled out. Treatment may include nutritional support, medications, decompression or surgery. Management may require specialists from a variety of backgrounds.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001324-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Intestinal malrotation 50% Morphological abnormality of the central nervous system 50% Pyloric stenosis 50% Abnormality of thrombocytes 7.5% Patent ductus arteriosus 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
