			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Myelocerebellar disorder? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Myelocerebellar disorder. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the cerebellum 90% Gait disturbance 90% Incoordination 90% Abnormality of macrophages 50% Abnormality of neutrophils 50% Acute leukemia 50% Anemia 50% Hyperreflexia 50% Neurological speech impairment 50% Nystagmus 50% Recurrent respiratory infections 50% Splenomegaly 50% Abnormality of thrombocytes 7.5% Decreased antibody level in blood 7.5% Microcephaly 7.5% Acute myelomonocytic leukemia - Ataxia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cerebellar atrophy - Decreased nerve conduction velocity - Dysmetria - Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes - Hypoplastic anemia - Impaired vibration sensation in the lower limbs - Pancytopenia - Unsteady gait - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
