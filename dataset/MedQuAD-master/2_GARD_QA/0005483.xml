			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Scalp ear nipple syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Scalp ear nipple syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal hair quantity 90% Abnormality of the antihelix 90% Abnormality of the antitragus 90% Abnormality of the tragus 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the earlobes 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the nipples 90% Abnormality of the fingernails 50% Cataract 50% Delayed eruption of teeth 50% Hypertension 50% Recurrent urinary tract infections 50% Telecanthus 50% Type I diabetes mellitus 50% Abnormality of the kidney 7.5% Abnormality of the ureter 7.5% Cleft eyelid 7.5% Hypohidrosis 7.5% Anteverted nares 5% Blepharophimosis 5% Congenital cataract 5% Epicanthus 5% Hypotelorism 5% Iris coloboma 5% Mandibular prognathia 5% Pyelonephritis 5% Renal agenesis 5% Renal hypoplasia 5% Renal insufficiency 5% Short columella 5% Sparse hair 5% 2-3 toe syndactyly - 3-4 finger cutaneous syndactyly - Abnormality of the endocrine system - Abnormality of the thorax - Agenesis of permanent teeth - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Breast aplasia - Cupped ear - Depressed nasal bridge - Low-set ears - Microtia - Nail dysplasia - Palpebral edema - Protruding ear - Small earlobe - Underdeveloped antitragus - Underdeveloped tragus - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
