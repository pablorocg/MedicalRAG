			<Question qid="0005250-1" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Raine syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Raine syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Raine syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Anteverted nares 90% Depressed nasal ridge 90% Enlarged thorax 90% Exaggerated cupid&apos;s bow 90% Increased bone mineral density 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Microcephaly 90% Short neck 90% Gingival overgrowth 50% Intrauterine growth retardation 50% Proptosis 50% Respiratory insufficiency 50% Short nose 50% Mixed hearing impairment 7.5% Natal tooth 7.5% Bowing of the long bones 5% Brachydactyly syndrome 5% Highly arched eyebrow 5% Hydrocephalus 5% Hydronephrosis 5% Hypoplasia of dental enamel 5% Long hallux 5% Mandibular prognathia 5% Microdontia 5% Micromelia 5% Pectus excavatum 5% Plagiocephaly 5% Protruding ear 5% Wide mouth 5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Brachyturricephaly - Cerebral calcification - Choanal atresia - Choanal stenosis - Cleft palate - Depressed nasal bridge - Elevated alkaline phosphatase - High palate - Hypertelorism - Hypophosphatemia - Hypoplasia of midface - Large fontanelles - Malar flattening - Narrow mouth - Neonatal death - Protruding tongue - Pulmonary hypoplasia - Short stature - Thoracic hypoplasia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
