			<Question qid="0004673-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Paget disease of bone ?</Question>
			<Answer>Paget disease of bone is a disorder that involves abnormal bone destruction and regrowth, which results in deformity. This condition can affect any of the bones in the body; but most people have it in their spine, pelvis, skull, or leg bones. The disease may affect only one bone or several bones; but it does not affect the entire skeleton. Bones with Paget disease may break more easily, and the disease can lead to other health problems. The cause of Paget disease is unknown, although it may be associated with faulty genes or viral infections early in life.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004673-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Paget disease of bone ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Paget disease of bone? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Paget disease of bone. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Bilateral conductive hearing impairment 40% Abnormality of pelvic girdle bone morphology - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Bone pain - Brain stem compression - Cranial nerve paralysis - Elevated alkaline phosphatase - Fractures of the long bones - Heterogeneous - Hydroxyprolinuria - Increased susceptibility to fractures - Long-tract signs - Osteolysis - Paraparesis - Tetraparesis - Vertebral compression fractures - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
