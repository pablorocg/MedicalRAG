			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Preaxial polydactyly type 2? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Preaxial polydactyly type 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Duplication of thumb phalanx 90% Finger syndactyly 90% Opposable triphalangeal thumb 90% Preaxial hand polydactyly 90% Triphalangeal thumb 90% Duplication of phalanx of hallux 75% Preaxial foot polydactyly 75% Abnormality of the metacarpal bones 50% Postaxial hand polydactyly 50% Toe syndactyly 50% Postaxial foot polydactyly 33% Syndactyly 33% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Complete duplication of distal phalanx of the thumb - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
