			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Flynn Aird syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Flynn Aird syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the skin 90% Myopia 90% Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Visual impairment 90% Abnormality of retinal pigmentation 50% Atherosclerosis 50% Bone cyst 50% Carious teeth 50% Cataract 50% Decreased body weight 50% Developmental regression 50% EEG abnormality 50% Impaired pain sensation 50% Incoordination 50% Kyphosis 50% Limitation of joint mobility 50% Neurological speech impairment 50% Scoliosis 50% Seizures 50% Skeletal muscle atrophy 50% Skin ulcer 50% Abnormality of movement 7.5% Abnormality of the thyroid gland 7.5% Cerebral calcification 7.5% Cerebral cortical atrophy 7.5% Primary adrenal insufficiency 7.5% Type II diabetes mellitus 7.5% Alopecia - Aphasia - Ataxia - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Dementia - Dermal atrophy - Hyperkeratosis - Increased bone density with cystic changes - Increased CSF protein - Joint stiffness - Kyphoscoliosis - Osteoporosis - Progressive sensorineural hearing impairment - Rod-cone dystrophy - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
