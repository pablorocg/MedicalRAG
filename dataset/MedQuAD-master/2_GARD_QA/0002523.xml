			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Genitopatellar syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Genitopatellar syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal nasal morphology 90% Abnormality of female external genitalia 90% Abnormality of pelvic girdle bone morphology 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Cryptorchidism 90% Microcephaly 90% Patellar aplasia 90% Polycystic kidney dysplasia 90% Prominent nasal bridge 90% Scrotal hypoplasia 90% Abnormal hair quantity 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum 50% Delayed eruption of teeth 50% Fine hair 50% Hypertelorism 50% Long philtrum 50% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 50% Neurological speech impairment 50% Seizures 50% Talipes 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the lungs 7.5% Apnea 7.5% Atria septal defect 7.5% Hearing impairment 7.5% Radioulnar synostosis 7.5% Short stature 7.5% Agenesis of corpus callosum - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Clitoral hypertrophy - Coarse facial features - Colpocephaly - Congenital hip dislocation - Dysphagia - Hip contracture - Hydronephrosis - Hypertrophic labia minora - Hypoplastic inferior pubic rami - Hypoplastic ischia - Intellectual disability, progressive - Knee flexion contracture - Laryngomalacia - Micropenis - Multicystic kidney dysplasia - Muscular hypotonia - Patellar dislocation - Periventricular gray matter heterotopia - Polyhydramnios - Prominent nose - Pulmonary hypoplasia - Short phalanx of finger - Sparse scalp hair - Talipes equinovarus - Ventricular septal defect - Wide nose - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
