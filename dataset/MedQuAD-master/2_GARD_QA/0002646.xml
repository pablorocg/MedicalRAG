			<Question qid="0002646-1" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Gonadal dysgenesis, XX type ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Gonadal dysgenesis, XX type? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Gonadal dysgenesis, XX type. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Polycystic ovaries 90% Primary amenorrhea 90% Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Cerebral cortical atrophy 50% Short stature 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the cerebellum 7.5% Cognitive impairment 7.5% Decreased nerve conduction velocity 7.5% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 7.5% Incoordination 7.5% Nystagmus 7.5% Oculomotor apraxia 7.5% Ophthalmoparesis 7.5% Peripheral neuropathy 7.5% Ptosis 7.5% Scoliosis 7.5% Secondary amenorrhea 7.5% Areflexia 5% Cerebellar atrophy 5% Dysarthria 5% Hyporeflexia 5% Motor delay 5% Sensorimotor neuropathy 5% Spastic diplegia 5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Gait ataxia - Gonadal dysgenesis - High palate - Increased circulating gonadotropin level - Limited extraocular movements - Osteoporosis - Pes cavus - Phenotypic variability - Talipes equinovarus - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
