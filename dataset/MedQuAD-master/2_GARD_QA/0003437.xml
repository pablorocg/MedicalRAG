			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Kuster Majewski Hammerstein syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Kuster Majewski Hammerstein syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal hair quantity 90% Abnormality of retinal pigmentation 90% Abnormality of the macula 90% Retinopathy 90% Split hand 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the eyebrow 50% Carious teeth 50% Finger syndactyly 50% Microdontia 50% Reduced number of teeth 50% Strabismus 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Camptodactyly - Ectodermal dysplasia - Joint contracture of the hand - Macular dystrophy - Selective tooth agenesis - Sparse eyebrow - Sparse eyelashes - Sparse scalp hair - Syndactyly - Widely spaced teeth - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
