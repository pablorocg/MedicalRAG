			<Question qid="0003748-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Majeed syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Majeed syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation in the bones and skin. The two main features of this condition are chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA). CRMO causes recurrent episodes of pain and joint swelling which can lead to complications such as slow growth and the development of joint deformities called contractures. CDA involves a shortage of red blood cells which can lead to fatigue (tiredness), weakness, pale skin, and shortness of breath. Most people with Majeed syndrome also develop inflammatory disorders of the skin, most often a condition known as Sweet syndrome. Majeed syndrome results from mutations in the LPIN2 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003748-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Majeed syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Majeed syndrome? Majeed syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation in the bones and skin. There are two main features of Majeed syndrome: Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO), an inflammatory bone condition which causes recurrent episodes of pain and joint swelling. These symptoms begin in infancy or early childhood and typically persist into adulthood, although there may be short periods of improvement. CRMO can lead to complications such as slow growth and the development of joint deformities called contractures, which restrict the movement of certain joints. Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia is a blood disorder which involve a shortage of red blood cells. Without enough of these cells, the blood cannot carry an adequate supply of oxygen to the body&apos;s tissues. The resulting symptoms can include tiredness (fatigue), weakness, pale skin, and shortness of breath. Complications of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia can range from mild to severe. Most people with Majeed syndrome also develop inflammatory disorders of the skin, most often a condition known as Sweet syndrome. The symptoms of Sweet syndrome include fever and the development of painful bumps or blisters on the face, neck, back, and arms. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Majeed syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of temperature regulation 90% Abnormality of the metaphyses 90% Arthralgia 90% Bone pain 90% Microcytic anemia 90% Osteomyelitis 90% Pustule 90% Skin rash 90% Weight loss 90% Acne 50% Arthritis 50% Edema 50% Hepatomegaly 50% Hyperostosis 50% Leukocytosis 50% Migraine 50% Myalgia 50% Splenomegaly 50% Abnormal blistering of the skin 7.5% Abnormality of bone mineral density 7.5% Flexion contracture 7.5% Glomerulopathy 7.5% Hematuria 7.5% Inflammatory abnormality of the eye 7.5% Malabsorption 7.5% Proteinuria 7.5% Pulmonary infiltrates 7.5% Recurrent fractures 7.5% Vasculitis 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003748-3" qtype="causes">What causes Majeed syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What causes Majeed syndrome? Majeed syndrome is caused by mutations in the LPIN2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called lipin-2. Researchers believe that this protein may play a role in the processing of fats. It may also be involved in controlling inflammation and play a role in cell division. Mutations in the LPIN2 gene alter the structure and function of lipin-2. It is unclear how these genetic changes lead to bone disease, anemia, and inflammation of the skin in people with Majeed syndrome.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003748-4" qtype="inheritance">Is Majeed syndrome inherited ?</Question>
			<Answer>How is Majeed syndrome inherited? Majeed syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene. Although carriers typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition, some parents of children with Majeed syndrome have had an inflammatory skin disorder called psoriasis.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003748-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Majeed syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>How might Majeed syndrome be treated? Treatment is based upon the symptoms present. Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy to avoid disuse atrophy of muscles and contractures. If CRMO does not respond to NSAIDs, corticosteroids can be used short term to control CRMO and skin manifestations. Resolution of bone inflammation has been reported in at least two children who were treated with an IL-1 inhibitor. Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) may be treated with red blood cell transfusion.</Answer>
