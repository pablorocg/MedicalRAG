			<Question qid="0003700-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lymphedema distichiasis syndrome is a condition that affects the normal function of the lymphatic system (part of the immune system that produces and transports fluids and immune cells throughout the body). People with this condition are born with extra eyelashes (distichiasis) and develop puffiness or swelling (lymphedema) of the limbs by the time they are in their forties. The abnormal eyelashes, which grow along the inner lining of the eyelid, often touch the eyeball and can cause damage to the clear covering of the eye (cornea). Other eye problems such as an irregular curvature of the cornea causing blurred vision (astigmatism) or scarring of the cornea may also occur. Other health problems, varicose veins, droopy eyelids (ptosis), heart abnormalities, and an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), may also be present. Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome is caused by mutations in the FOXC2 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003700-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Corneal erosion 90% Distichiasis 90% Photophobia 90% Cataract 50% Muscle weakness 50% Ptosis 50% Abnormality of the pulmonary vasculature 7.5% Arrhythmia 7.5% Benign neoplasm of the central nervous system 7.5% Diabetes mellitus 7.5% Glomerulopathy 7.5% Patent ductus arteriosus 7.5% Proteinuria 7.5% Recurrent urinary tract infections 7.5% Renal duplication 7.5% Sarcoma 7.5% Skin ulcer 7.5% Webbed neck 7.5% Cleft palate 4% Cleft upper lip 4% Abnormality of the musculature - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Conjunctivitis - Corneal ulceration - Lymphedema - Predominantly lower limb lymphedema - Recurrent corneal erosions - Tetralogy of Fallot - Varicose veins - Ventricular septal defect - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
