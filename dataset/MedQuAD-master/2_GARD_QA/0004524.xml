			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Okamoto syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Okamoto syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the eyelashes 90% Abnormality of the hip bone 90% Anteverted nares 90% Cleft palate 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Depressed nasal bridge 90% Downturned corners of mouth 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Malar flattening 90% Muscular hypotonia 90% Open mouth 90% Proptosis 90% Short nose 90% Abnormality of the cardiac septa 50% Abnormality of the fingernails 50% Epicanthus 50% Long philtrum 50% Synophrys 50% Webbed neck 50% Abnormality of female internal genitalia 7.5% Abnormality of the aortic valve 7.5% Abnormality of the pinna 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum 7.5% Finger syndactyly 7.5% Hypertelorism 7.5% Hypoplastic left heart 7.5% Intestinal malrotation 7.5% Microcephaly 7.5% Patent ductus arteriosus 7.5% Renal hypoplasia/aplasia 7.5% Splenomegaly 7.5% Tented upper lip vermilion 7.5% Urogenital fistula 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
