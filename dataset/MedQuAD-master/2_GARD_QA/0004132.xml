			<Question qid="0004132-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Mosaic trisomy 14 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Mosaic trisomy 14 is a rare chromosomal disorder in which there are 3 copies (trisomy) of chromosome 14 in some cells of the body, while other cells have the usual two copies. The extent and severity of features in affected individuals can vary. Signs and symptoms that have been most commonly reported include intrauterine growth restriction; failure to to thrive; developmental delay; intellectual disability; distinctive facial characteristics; structural malformations of the heart; and other physical abnormalities. This condition is most often caused by an error in cell division in the egg or sperm cell before conception, or in fetal cells after fertilization. Treatment is directed toward the specific signs and symptoms in each individual.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004132-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Mosaic trisomy 14 ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Mosaic trisomy 14? The effects of mosaic trisomy 14 can vary considerably among affected individuals. Some children with mosaic trisomy 14 grow into healthy, if small, children. Others may have continued difficulty thriving. Those that have a low percentage of affected cells may have fewer and/or less severe symptoms than those with a high percentage of affected cells. Some of the more commonly reported characteristics of the condition include: intrauterine growth restriction feeding difficulties failure to thrive some degree of developmental delay or intellectual disability slightly asymmetrical growth abnormal skin pigmentation structural defect(s) of the heart such as tetralogy of Fallot minor genital abnormalities in boys such as undescended testes distinctive facial characteristics such as a prominent forehead; widely spaced eyes; a broad nasal bridge; low-set, malformed ears; a small lower jaw; a large mouth and thick lips; eye abnormalities; or abnormality of the roof of the mouth (palate) Skeletal abnormalities have also been reported and include dislocation of the hips; overlapping of certain fingers or toes; and/or other features. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Mosaic trisomy 14. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of chromosome segregation 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Frontal bossing 90% Prominent nasal bridge 90% Short neck 90% Short stature 90% Wide mouth 90% Anteverted nares 50% Blepharophimosis 50% Cleft palate 50% Cryptorchidism 50% Displacement of the external urethral meatus 50% Ectopic anus 50% Hypertelorism 50% Hypoplasia of penis 50% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 50% Narrow chest 50% Seizures 50% Single transverse palmar crease 50% Abnormality of the ribs 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia affecting the eye 7.5% Camptodactyly of finger 7.5% Lower limb asymmetry 7.5% Ptosis 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004132-3" qtype="causes">What causes Mosaic trisomy 14 ?</Question>
			<Answer>What causes mosaic trisomy 14? Individuals with mosaic trisomy 14 have a duplication of chromosome 14 material in some of their cells, while other cells have a normal chromosomal makeup. The additional chromosomal material is responsible for the features that are characteristic of the condition. Most cases of mosaic trisomy 14 appear to result from random errors in the separation of chromosomes (nondisjunction) -- either during the division of the egg or sperm in one of the parents, or during cell division after fertilization. There have been some reports in which it may have occurred due to other phenomenon, such as uniparental disomy or the formation of an isochromosome. Uniparental disomy is when an affected individual inherits both copies of a chromosomal pair from one parent, rather than one copy from each parent. An isochromosome is an abnormal chromosome with identical arms on each side of the centromere.

			<Question qid="0004132-4" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Mosaic trisomy 14 ?</Question>
			<Answer>How might mosaic trisomy 14 be treated? Treatment for signs and symptoms of mosaic trisomy 14 focuses on the specific features present in each individual. Infants with congenital heart defects may need surgery or other therapies to alleviate symptoms and correct heart malformations. Respiratory infections should be treated aggressively and early. Some infants and children with the condition may need surgical repair of certain craniofacial, genital, or other abnormalities. Early intervention may be important in ensuring that children with the reach their potential. Special services that may be beneficial include special education, physical therapy, and/or other medical, social, and/or vocational services.</Answer>
