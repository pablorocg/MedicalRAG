			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Pallister W syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Pallister W syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Acne 90% Broad forehead 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Eczema 90% Hypertonia 90% Macrotia 90% Mandibular prognathia 90% Narrow face 90% Short philtrum 90% Short stature 90% Strabismus 90% Wide nasal bridge 90% Camptodactyly of finger 50% Camptodactyly of toe 50% Cleft palate 50% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 50% Cubitus valgus 50% Elbow dislocation 50% Hearing impairment 50% Hypertelorism 50% Median cleft lip 50% Non-midline cleft lip 50% Pes cavus 50% Seizures 50% Displacement of the external urethral meatus 7.5% Agenesis of central incisor - Agenesis of maxillary central incisor - Alternating esotropia - Broad nasal tip - Broad uvula - Camptodactyly - Clinodactyly - Depressed nasal bridge - Frontal bossing - Frontal upsweep of hair - Hypoplasia of the ulna - Intellectual disability - Joint contracture of the hand - Pes planus - Radial bowing - Radial deviation of finger - Spasticity - Submucous cleft hard palate - Telecanthus - X-linked inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
