			<Question qid="0003034-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Hypertryptophanemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hypertryptophanemia is a rare condition that likely occurs due to abnormalities in the body&apos;s ability to process the amino acid (a building block of proteins), tryptophan. People affected by this condition may experience intellectual disability and behavioral problems (i.e. periodic mood swings, exaggerated emotional responses and abnormal sexual behavior). The underlying genetic cause of hypertryptophanemia is currently unknown; however, it appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003034-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Hypertryptophanemia ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Hypertryptophanemia? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hypertryptophanemia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal dermatoglyphics 90% Neurological speech impairment 90% Abnormality of the elbow 50% Abnormality of the femur 50% Abnormality of the hip bone 50% Abnormality of the knees 50% Abnormality of the ulna 50% Abnormality of the wrist 50% Adducted thumb 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the radius 50% Asymmetry of the thorax 50% Cognitive impairment 50% EEG abnormality 50% Hyperhidrosis 50% Hypertelorism 50% Joint hypermobility 50% Myopia 50% Strabismus 50% Ulnar deviation of finger 50% Aggressive behavior - Camptodactyly of finger - Emotional lability - Generalized joint laxity - Hypersexuality - Limited elbow extension - Pes planus - Tryptophanuria - Visual impairment - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
