			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Hand and foot deformity with flat facies? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hand and foot deformity with flat facies. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Camptodactyly of finger 90% Depressed nasal bridge 90% High forehead 90% Long philtrum 90% Malar flattening 90% Abnormality of the palate 50% Coarse hair 50% Low posterior hairline 50% Muscular hypotonia 50% Abnormality of the foot - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Contractures of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb - Flat face - Intellectual disability - Metacarpophalangeal joint contracture - Neonatal hypotonia - Short stature - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
