			<Question qid="0002779-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Hemolytic uremic syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a disorder that usually occurs when an  E. coli bacterial infection in the digestive system produces toxic substances that destroy red blood cells. Symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea, fever, lethargy, and weakness. In severe cases it can lead to kidney failure or death. While this condition is most common in children, it often has a more complicated presentation in adults. Treatment may include dialysis, corticosteroids, transfusions of packed red blood cells and plasmapheresis.   Hemolytic uremic syndrome should be distinguished from atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). The two conditions have different causes and different signs and symptoms.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002779-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Hemolytic uremic syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Hemolytic uremic syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hemolytic uremic syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Acute kidney injury - Anuria - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cognitive impairment - Coma - Decreased serum complement C3 - Decreased serum complement factor B - Decreased serum complement factor H - Decreased serum complement factor I - Diarrhea - Dysphasia - Elevated serum creatinine - Fever - Hemiparesis - Hemolytic-uremic syndrome - Hyperlipidemia - Hypertension - Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) - Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia - Purpura - Reticulocytosis - Schistocytosis - Seizures - Thrombocytopenia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002779-3" qtype="causes">What causes Hemolytic uremic syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What causes hemolytic uremic syndrome? Hemolytic uremic syndrome often occurs after a gastrointestinal infections with E. coli bacteria (Escherichia coli 0157:H7). The condition has also been linked to other gastrointestinal infections, including shigella and salmonella, as well as infections outside of the gastrointestinal system. The condition results when the bacteria lodge in the digestive tract and produce toxins that can enter the bloodstream. The toxins travel through the bloodstream and can destroy blood cells, causing acute kidney injury.</Answer>
