			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Metaphyseal dysplasia maxillary hypoplasia brachydactyly? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Metaphyseal dysplasia maxillary hypoplasia brachydactyly. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of dental color 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Convex nasal ridge 90% Short philtrum 90% Short stature 90% Thin vermilion border 90% Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 50% Abnormality of the femur 50% Abnormality of the humerus 50% Camptodactyly of finger 50% Craniofacial hyperostosis 50% Reduced bone mineral density 50% Cerebral cortical atrophy 7.5% Recurrent fractures 7.5% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Flared metaphysis - Hypoplasia of the maxilla - Metaphyseal dysplasia - Multiple small vertebral fractures - Osteoporosis of vertebrae - Platyspondyly - Premature loss of teeth - Short 5th metacarpal - Short middle phalanx of the 2nd finger - Short middle phalanx of the 5th finger - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
