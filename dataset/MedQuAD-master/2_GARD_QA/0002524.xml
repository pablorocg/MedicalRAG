			<Question qid="0002524-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Genoa syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Genoa syndrome is a rare condition that primarily affects the brain and skull. Babies with this condition are generally born with semilobar holoprosencephaly, a disorder caused by failure of the developing brain to sufficiently divide into the double lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. They later develop craniosynostosis (the premature closure of one or more of the fibrous joints between the bones of the skull before brain growth is complete). Genoa syndrome also appears to be associated with other skeletal abnormalities, including those of the hands, and distinctive facial features. The underlying genetic cause of the condition is currently unknown. Some reports suggest that Genoa syndrome may be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002524-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Genoa syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Genoa syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Genoa syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 90% Abnormality of retinal pigmentation 90% Abnormality of the hip bone 90% Blepharophimosis 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Craniosynostosis 90% Delayed skeletal maturation 90% Epicanthus 90% Facial asymmetry 90% Holoprosencephaly 90% Hypotelorism 90% Microcephaly 90% Muscular hypotonia 90% Plagiocephaly 90% Short distal phalanx of finger 90% Short stature 90% Skeletal muscle atrophy 90% Strabismus 90% Upslanted palpebral fissure 90% Coronal craniosynostosis - Coxa valga - Hypoplastic vertebral bodies - Lambdoidal craniosynostosis - Semilobar holoprosencephaly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
