			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Male pseudohermaphroditism intellectual disability syndrome, Verloes type? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Male pseudohermaphroditism intellectual disability syndrome, Verloes type. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the nipple 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Deeply set eye 90% Downturned corners of mouth 90% Genu valgum 90% Hypoplasia of penis 90% Kyphosis 90% Low posterior hairline 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Reduced bone mineral density 90% Scrotal hypoplasia 90% Short neck 90% Short nose 90% Short philtrum 90% Short thorax 90% Spina bifida occulta 90% Synophrys 90% Thin vermilion border 90% Absent speech - Bilateral microphthalmos - Cervical spina bifida - Chorioretinal coloboma - Coarse facial features - Intellectual disability - Male pseudohermaphroditism - Obesity - Postnatal growth retardation - Severe sensorineural hearing impairment - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
