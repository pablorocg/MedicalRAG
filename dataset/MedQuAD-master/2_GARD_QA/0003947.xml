			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Mental retardation-hypotonic facies syndrome X-linked, 1? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Mental retardation-hypotonic facies syndrome X-linked, 1. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the palate 90% Anteverted nares 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Depressed nasal bridge 90% Microcephaly 90% Narrow forehead 90% Short stature 90% Tented upper lip vermilion 90% Behavioral abnormality 50% Genu valgum 50% Neurological speech impairment 50% Obesity 50% Seizures 35% Abnormality of the hip bone 7.5% Camptodactyly of finger 7.5% Cryptorchidism 7.5% Low posterior hairline 7.5% Wide mouth 7.5% Abnormality of blood and blood-forming tissues - Brachydactyly syndrome - Coarse facial features - Constipation - Decreased testicular size - Delayed skeletal maturation - Dolichocephaly - Drooling - Epicanthus - Exotropia - Gastroesophageal reflux - High palate - Hyperactivity - Hyperreflexia - Hypertelorism - Hypogonadism - Hypoplasia of midface - Hypospadias - Infantile muscular hypotonia - Intellectual disability, progressive - Intellectual disability, severe - Kyphoscoliosis - Lower limb hypertonia - Low-set ears - Macroglossia - Malar flattening - Micropenis - Microtia - Open mouth - Optic atrophy - Paroxysmal bursts of laughter - Pes planus - Phenotypic variability - Posteriorly rotated ears - Protruding tongue - Ptosis - Radial deviation of finger - Renal hypoplasia - Scrotal hypoplasia - Sensorineural hearing impairment - Short neck - Short upper lip - Slender finger - Talipes calcaneovalgus - Talipes equinovarus - Tapered finger - Thick lower lip vermilion - Triangular nasal tip - Upslanted palpebral fissure - U-Shaped upper lip vermilion - Vesicoureteral reflux - Vomiting - Wide nasal bridge - Widely-spaced maxillary central incisors - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
