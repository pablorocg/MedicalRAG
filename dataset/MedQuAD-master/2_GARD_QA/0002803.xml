			<Question qid="0002803-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Hepatic lipase deficiency ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hepatic lipase deficiency is a rare condition that is characterized by increased levels of certain fats (known as triglycerides and cholesterol) in the blood. Affected people may also have increased levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) and decreased levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are two molecules that help transport fats throughout the body. Hepatic lipase deficiency may be associated with an increased risk of developing atherosclerosis and/or heart disease; however, additional research is needed on the long-term outlook of people with this condition. Hepatic lipase deficiency is caused by changes (mutations) in the LIPC gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002803-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Hepatic lipase deficiency ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Hepatic lipase deficiency? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hepatic lipase deficiency. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Angina pectoris - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Eruptive xanthomas - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
