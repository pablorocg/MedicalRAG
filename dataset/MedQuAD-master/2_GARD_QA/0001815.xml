			<Answer>Dextrocardia is a condition in which the heart is located in the right side of the chest instead of the left. It is usually present from birth (congenital). There are several types of dextrocardia.  The simplest type occurs when the shape and structure of the heart is a mirror image of a normal heart.  Other types of dextrocardia may involve defects of the walls of the heart, nearby blood vessels, or other organs in the abdomen. Chest X-raxys and echocardiograms can be used to determine which type of dextrocardia is present.</Answer>
