			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Zunich neuroectodermal syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Zunich neuroectodermal syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal dermatoglyphics 90% Abnormality of calvarial morphology 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the nipples 90% Chorioretinal coloboma 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Depressed nasal ridge 90% Epicanthus 90% External ear malformation 90% Hearing impairment 90% Hypertelorism 90% Ichthyosis 90% Microdontia 90% Ptosis 90% Reduced number of teeth 90% Short philtrum 90% Strabismus 90% Tall stature 90% Thick lower lip vermilion 90% Abnormality of epiphysis morphology 50% Abnormality of the clavicle 50% Abnormality of the pulmonary valve 50% Adactyly 50% Brachydactyly syndrome 50% Cleft palate 50% Increased number of teeth 50% Opacification of the corneal stroma 50% Seizures 50% Short toe 50% Tetralogy of Fallot 50% Transposition of the great arteries 50% Upslanted palpebral fissure 50% Abnormal hair quantity 7.5% Abnormality of the hip bone 7.5% Abnormality of the kidney 7.5% Acute leukemia 7.5% Autism 7.5% Cerebral cortical atrophy 7.5% Clubbing of toes 7.5% Fine hair 7.5% Hyperkeratosis 7.5% Osteolysis 7.5% Skin ulcer 7.5% Ventricular septal defect 7.5% Acute lymphoblastic leukemia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Brachycephaly - Broad-based gait - Cerebral atrophy - Clinodactyly of the 5th finger - Conductive hearing impairment - Duplicated collecting system - Frontal bossing - Hydronephrosis - Hypoplastic nipples - Intellectual disability - Joint contracture of the hand - Large for gestational age - Large hands - Long foot - Low-set nipples - Muscular hypotonia - Overfolded helix - Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis - Peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis - Prominent forehead - Retinal coloboma - Sparse hair - Ureteropelvic junction obstruction - Violent behavior - Webbed neck - Wide mouth - Wide nasal bridge - Widely spaced teeth - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
