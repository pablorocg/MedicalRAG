			<Question qid="0004190-1" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia 1 ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia 1? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia 1. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the hip bone 50% Arthralgia 50% Brachydactyly syndrome 50% Micromelia 50% Genu valgum 7.5% Genu varum 7.5% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Avascular necrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis - Broad femoral neck - Delayed epiphyseal ossification - Disproportionate short-limb short stature - Epiphyseal dysplasia - Generalized joint laxity - Hip osteoarthritis - Irregular epiphyses - Irregular vertebral endplates - Joint stiffness - Limited hip movement - Mild short stature - Ovoid vertebral bodies - Short femoral neck - Short metacarpal - Short phalanx of finger - Small epiphyses - Waddling gait - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
