			<Question qid="0002412-1" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Fountain syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Fountain syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Fountain syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Coarse facial features 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Craniofacial hyperostosis 90% Edema 90% Round face 90% Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Thick lower lip vermilion 90% EEG abnormality 50% Full cheeks 50% Hyperextensible skin 50% Malar flattening 50% Wide mouth 50% Abnormality of the metacarpal bones 7.5% Abnormality of the metaphyses 7.5% Abnormality of the palate 7.5% Clubbing of toes 7.5% Cutis marmorata 7.5% Gingival overgrowth 7.5% Kyphosis 7.5% Large hands 7.5% Macrocephaly 7.5% Neurological speech impairment 7.5% Scoliosis 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Short stature 7.5% Spina bifida occulta 7.5% Thick eyebrow 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Broad palm - Facial edema - Intellectual disability - Thickened calvaria - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
