			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Mac Dermot Winter syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Mac Dermot Winter syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the nipple 90% Blepharophimosis 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Cryptorchidism 90% Dolichocephaly 90% Highly arched eyebrow 90% Hypertonia 90% Hypoplasia of penis 90% Intrauterine growth retardation 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Macrotia 90% Microcephaly 90% Overfolded helix 90% Prominent nasal bridge 90% Scrotal hypoplasia 90% Seizures 90% Short nose 90% Abnormality of the upper urinary tract 50% Abnormality of the voice 50% Brachydactyly syndrome 50% Camptodactyly of finger 50% Short neck 50% Single transverse palmar crease 50% Thickened nuchal skin fold 50% Underdeveloped nasal alae 50% Ventriculomegaly 50% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Death in infancy - Frontal upsweep of hair - Hydronephrosis - Hypoplastic male external genitalia - Low anterior hairline - Posteriorly rotated ears - Prominent glabella - Wide intermamillary distance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
