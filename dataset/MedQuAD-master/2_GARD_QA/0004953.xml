			<Question qid="0004953-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Polyembryoma ?</Question>
			<Answer>Polyembryoma is a type of tumor that develops from the cells of the gonads (testes in men or ovaries in women).  Such tumors are called germ cell tumors.  Polyembryomas have a distinctive look because they are composed of many parts that are shaped like embryos, one of the earliest stages of a developing human during pregnancy.  Symptoms of a polyembryoma may include an unusual bump or mass in the abdomen which can cause pain in some individuals; puberty at an unusually young age (known as precocious puberty); or irregularities in a female&apos;s menstruation.  Treatment begins with surgery and may be followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.  The cause of polyembryoma is not yet known.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004953-2" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Polyembryoma ?</Question>
			<Answer>How might polyembryoma be treated? Because polyembryomas are quite rare, there are no established guidelines for treating this condition.  However, the first step for treating a polyembryoma is often surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible.  Chemotherapy, and sometimes radiation therapy, have also been used after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that may remain.</Answer>
