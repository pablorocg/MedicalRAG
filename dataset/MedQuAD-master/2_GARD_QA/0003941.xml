			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Mental retardation x-linked with cerebellar hypoplasia and distinctive facial appearance? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Mental retardation x-linked with cerebellar hypoplasia and distinctive facial appearance. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the cerebellum 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 50% Autism 50% Muscular hypotonia 50% Neurological speech impairment 50% Seizures 50% Strabismus 50% Abnormality of the mouth 7.5% Cerebral cortical atrophy 7.5% Cryptorchidism 7.5% Deeply set eye 7.5% Frontal bossing 7.5% Incoordination 7.5% Long face 7.5% Macrotia 7.5% Ventriculomegaly 7.5% Cerebellar hypoplasia - Delayed speech and language development - Disorganization of the anterior cerebellar vermis - Enlarged cisterna magna - Gait ataxia - Hyperactivity - Hypotelorism - Infantile onset - Intellectual disability - Long nose - Macrocephaly - Mandibular prognathia - Micropenis - Microphallus - Nystagmus - Prominent forehead - Prominent supraorbital ridges - Retrocerebellar cyst - Scrotal hypoplasia - Short philtrum - Spasticity - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
