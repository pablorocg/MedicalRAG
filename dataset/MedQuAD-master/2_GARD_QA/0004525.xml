			<Question qid="0004525-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Oligoastrocytoma ?</Question>
			<Answer>Oligoastrocytoma is a brain tumor that forms when two types of cells in the brain, called oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, rapidly increase in number to form a mass.  These brain cells are known as glial cells, which normally protect and support nerve cells in the brain.  Because an oligoastrocytoma is made up of a combination of two cell types, it is known as a mixed glioma.  Oligoastrocytomas usually occur in a part of the brain called the cerebrum and are diagnosed in adults between the ages of 30 and 50.  The exact cause of this condition is unknown.</Answer>
