			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Limb deficiencies distal with micrognathia? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Limb deficiencies distal with micrognathia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of chromosome segregation 90% Abnormality of the ankles 90% Abnormality of the metacarpal bones 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Split foot 90% Abnormality of the wrist 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the radius 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the thumb 50% Cognitive impairment 50% Conductive hearing impairment 50% Cryptorchidism 50% Myopia 50% Narrow mouth 50% Proteinuria 50% Renal hypoplasia/aplasia 50% Renal insufficiency 50% Abnormality of the ulna 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the tongue 7.5% Cleft palate 7.5% Macrocephaly 7.5% Microdontia 7.5% Nystagmus 7.5% Prominent nasal bridge 7.5% Sensorineural hearing impairment 7.5% Short stature 7.5% Tarsal synostosis 7.5% Hypoplasia of the maxilla 5% Abnormality of the pinna - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Camptodactyly - High palate - Intellectual disability - Microretrognathia - Nail dystrophy - Renal hypoplasia - Ridged nail - Split hand - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
