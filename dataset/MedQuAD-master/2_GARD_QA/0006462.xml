			<Question qid="0006462-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Wolfram syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Wolfram syndrome, which is also known by the acronym DIDMOAD, is an inherited condition characterized by diabetes insipidus (DI), childhood-onset diabetes mellitus (DM), a gradual loss of vision caused by optic atrophy (OA), and deafness (D). There are two types of Wolfram syndrome (type 1 and type 2) which are primarily differentiated by their genetic cause. Type 1 is caused by changes (mutations) in the WFS1 gene, while type 2 is caused by mutations in the CISD2 gene. Both forms are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0006462-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Wolfram syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Wolfram syndrome? There are two types of Wolfram syndrome (type 1 and type 2) which have many overlapping features. Wolfram syndrome type 1, which is also known by the acronym DIDMOAD, is characterized by diabetes insipidus (DI), childhood-onset diabetes mellitus (DM), gradual loss of vision due to optic atrophy (OA), and deafness (D). About 65% of affected people will develop all four of these symptoms, while others will only have some of the associated health problems. Other signs and symptoms of Wolfram syndrome type 1 may include: Urinary tract abnormalities Ataxia (problems with coordination and balance) Loss of sense of smell Loss of gag reflex Myoclonus (muscle spasms) Peripheral neuropathy Seizures Depression Impulsive and/or aggressive behavior Psychosis Gastrointestinal problems Intellectual disability Central apnea and central respiratory failure Hypogonadism in males (reduced amounts of the sex hormone testosterone) In addition to the signs and symptoms found in Wolfram syndrome type 1, people with Wolfram syndrome type 2 may also have stomach and/or intestinal ulcers; and a tendancy to bleed excessivly after injuries.   The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Wolfram syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Diabetes insipidus 90% Diabetes mellitus 90% Hearing impairment 90% Optic atrophy 90% Hypoglycemia 50% Incoordination 50% Nephropathy 50% Neurological speech impairment 50% Nystagmus 50% Recurrent urinary tract infections 50% Seizures 50% Visual impairment 50% Abnormality of the autonomic nervous system 7.5% Abnormality of the gastric mucosa 7.5% Abnormality of the genital system 7.5% Anemia 7.5% Apnea 7.5% Cataract 7.5% Cerebral cortical atrophy 7.5% Cognitive impairment 7.5% Congestive heart failure 7.5% Constipation 7.5% Developmental regression 7.5% Feeding difficulties in infancy 7.5% Gastric ulcer 7.5% Gastrointestinal hemorrhage 7.5% Glaucoma 7.5% Hallucinations 7.5% Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 7.5% Hypothyroidism 7.5% Limitation of joint mobility 7.5% Malabsorption 7.5% Myopathy 7.5% Ophthalmoparesis 7.5% Peripheral neuropathy 7.5% Recurrent respiratory infections 7.5% Reduced consciousness/confusion 7.5% Renal insufficiency 7.5% Respiratory insufficiency 7.5% Retinopathy 7.5% Sleep disturbance 7.5% Abnormal bleeding - Abnormality of the skeletal system - Ataxia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Behavioral abnormality - Blindness - Cardiomyopathy - Cerebral atrophy - Dysarthria - Dysautonomia - Dysphagia - Growth delay - Hydronephrosis - Hydroureter - Impaired collagen-induced platelet aggregation - Intellectual disability - Limited mobility of proximal interphalangeal joint - Megaloblastic anemia - Neurogenic bladder - Neutropenia - Optic neuropathy - Pigmentary retinopathy - Ptosis - Sensorineural hearing impairment - Sideroblastic anemia - Stroke-like episodes - Testicular atrophy - Thrombocytopenia - Tremor - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0006462-3" qtype="causes">What causes Wolfram syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What causes Wolfram syndrome? There are two types of Wolfram syndrome (type 1 and type 2) which are primarily differentiated by their genetic cause. Changes (mutations) in the WFS1 gene are responsible for approximately 90% of Wolfram syndrome type 1 cases. This gene encodes wolframin, a protein that is important for the proper functioning of the endoplasmic reticulum (the part of a cell that is involved in protein production, processing, and transport). Wolframin helps regulate the amount of calcium in cells, which is important for many different cellular functions. Mutations in WFS1 result in a defective form of wolframin that is unable to perform its normal role. This causes cells to trigger their own death (apoptosis). The death of cells in various organs and other parts of the body results in the signs and symptoms of Wolfram syndrome type 1. A specific mutation in the CISD2 gene causes Wolfram syndrome type 2. Although the exact function of this gene is not known, scientists suspect that it plays an important role in the mitochondria (the part of the cell where energy is produced). Mutations in CISD2 lead to the loss of mitochondria which decreases the amount of energy available to cells. Cells that do not have enough energy die. As in Wolfram syndrome type 1, the death of cells in different parts of the body results in the many health problems associated with Wolfram syndrome type 2. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA may also be a rare cause of Wolfram syndrome in some families.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0006462-4" qtype="inheritance">Is Wolfram syndrome inherited ?</Question>
			<Answer>Is Wolfram syndrome inherited? Wolfram syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0006462-5" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Wolfram syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>How is Wolfram syndrome diagnosed? A diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome is based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. The identification of a change (mutation) in the WFS1 gene or CISD2 gene confirms the diagnosis. Is genetic testing available for Wolfram syndrome? Yes. Clinical genetic testing is available for changes (mutations) in WFS1 and CISD2, the two genes known to cause Wolfram syndrome type 1 and Wolfram syndrome type 2, respectively. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the two disease-causing mutations in the family are known. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. It offers information on genetic testing for Wolfram syndrome type 1 and Wolfram syndrome type 2. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0006462-6" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Wolfram syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>How might Wolfram syndrome be treated? Treatment of Wolfram syndrome is supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. For example, almost all affected people require insulin to treat diabetes mellitus. People with hearing loss may benefit from hearing aids or cochlear implantation.
