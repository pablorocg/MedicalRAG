			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Proximal chromosome 18q deletion syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Proximal chromosome 18q deletion syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Absence of the pulmonary valve - Aortic valve stenosis - Asthma - Atopic dermatitis - Atresia of the external auditory canal - Atria septal defect - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Bifid uvula - Blepharophimosis - Broad-based gait - Cerebellar hypoplasia - Choanal stenosis - Chorea - Cleft palate - Cleft upper lip - Conductive hearing impairment - Congestive heart failure - Cryptorchidism - Delayed CNS myelination - Depressed nasal bridge - Dilatation of the ascending aorta - Downturned corners of mouth - Dysplastic aortic valve - Dysplastic pulmonary valve - Epicanthus - Failure to thrive in infancy - Flat midface - Growth hormone deficiency - Hypertelorism - Hypoplasia of midface - Hypospadias - Inguinal hernia - Intellectual disability - Joint laxity - Low anterior hairline - Macrotia - Malar flattening - Mandibular prognathia - Microcephaly - Micropenis - Motor delay - Muscular hypotonia - Nystagmus - Optic atrophy - Overlapping toe - Patent ductus arteriosus - Pes cavus - Pes planus - Phenotypic variability - Poor coordination - Prominent nose - Proximal placement of thumb - Recurrent respiratory infections - Rocker bottom foot - Scoliosis - Secretory IgA deficiency - Seizures - Sensorineural hearing impairment - Short neck - Short palpebral fissure - Short philtrum - Short stature - Sporadic - Stenosis of the external auditory canal - Strabismus - Talipes equinovarus - Tapetoretinal degeneration - Toe syndactyly - Tremor - Umbilical hernia - U-Shaped upper lip vermilion - Ventricular septal defect - Ventriculomegaly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
