			<Question qid="0006157-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Transposition of the great arteries ?</Question>
			<Answer>Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a type of congenital heart defect in which there is a reversal of the normal connections of the aorta and the pulmonary artery with the heart. The aorta and pulmonary artery are reversed, which causes oxygen-poor blood to be circulated to the body and oxygen-rich blood to be circulated between the lungs and the heart, rather than to the body. Symptoms are apparent at birth and include great difficulty breathing and severe cyanosis (a bluish discoloration of the skin). The exact cause of TGA in most cases is unknown. Surgery is done to correct the abnormality during the first few days of life.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0006157-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Transposition of the great arteries ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Transposition of the great arteries? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Transposition of the great arteries. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Transposition of the great arteries - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0006157-3" qtype="causes">What causes Transposition of the great arteries ?</Question>
			<Answer>What causes transposition of the great arteries (TGA)? The exact cause of TGA remains unknown. Some possible associated risk factors that have been proposed include gestational diabetes mellitus, maternal exposure to rodenticides and herbicides, and maternal use of anti-epileptic drugs. Changes (mutations) in specific genes including the GDF1, CFC1 and MED13L (also called THRAP2) genes have been implicated in only a small minority of TGA cases.</Answer>
