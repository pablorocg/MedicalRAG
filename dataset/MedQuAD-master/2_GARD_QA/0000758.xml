			<Question qid="0000758-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome type 2 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome type 2 (BPES II) is a condition that mainly affects the development of the eyelids. People with this condition have a narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), and an upward fold of the skin of the lower eyelid near the inner corner of the eye (epicanthus inversus). In addition, there is an increased distance between the inner corners of the eyes (telecanthus). Because of these eyelid malformations, the eyelids cannot open fully, and vision may be limited. BPES type 2 consists only of the eyelid malformations, whereas  BPES type 1 also causes premature ovarian failure. It is caused by mutations in the FOXL2 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment typically consists of various eyelid surgeries to correct the malformations.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000758-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome type 2 ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome type 2? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome type 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Blepharophimosis 90% Depressed nasal bridge 90% Epicanthus 90% Ptosis 90% Decreased fertility 50% Lacrimation abnormality 50% Myopia 50% Nystagmus 7.5% Strabismus 7.5% Synophrys 7.5% Abnormality of the breast - Abnormality of the hair - Amenorrhea - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cupped ear - Epicanthus inversus - Female infertility - High palate - Hypermetropia - Increased circulating gonadotropin level - Microcornea - Microphthalmia - Premature ovarian failure - Telecanthus - Wide nasal bridge - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
