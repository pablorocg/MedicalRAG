			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia Shohat type? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia Shohat type. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of bone mineral density 90% Abnormality of epiphysis morphology 90% Abnormality of the femur 90% Abnormality of the hip bone 90% Abnormality of the metaphyses 90% Abnormality of the ribs 90% Genu varum 90% Hyperlordosis 90% Micromelia 90% Platyspondyly 90% Short neck 90% Short thorax 90% Thin vermilion border 90% Depressed nasal bridge 50% Gait disturbance 50% Hepatomegaly 50% Joint hypermobility 50% Round face 50% Splenomegaly 50% Wormian bones 7.5% Abdominal distention - Abnormality of the abdominal wall - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bell-shaped thorax - Central vertebral hypoplasia - Coxa vara - Delayed epiphyseal ossification - Disproportionate short stature - Fibular overgrowth - Flared metaphysis - Joint laxity - Lumbar hyperlordosis - Metaphyseal irregularity - Narrow greater sacrosciatic notches - Narrow vertebral interpedicular distance - Short femoral neck - Short ribs - Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia - Vertebral hypoplasia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
