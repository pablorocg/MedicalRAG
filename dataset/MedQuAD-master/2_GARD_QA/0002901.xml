			<Question qid="0002901-1" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hodgkin lymphoma. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of immune system physiology 90% Lymphadenopathy 90% Lymphoma 90% Abnormality of temperature regulation 50% Anorexia 50% Chest pain 50% Hyperhidrosis 50% Pruritus 50% Weight loss 50% Bone marrow hypocellularity 7.5% Bone pain 7.5% Hemoptysis 7.5% Hepatomegaly 7.5% Incoordination 7.5% Migraine 7.5% Peripheral neuropathy 7.5% Respiratory insufficiency 7.5% Splenomegaly 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Hodgkin lymphoma - Impaired lymphocyte transformation with phytohemagglutinin - Polyclonal elevation of IgM - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
