			<Question qid="0004484-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP) is a form of mucous membrane pemphigoid (a group of rare, chronic autoimmune disorders) that affects the eyes. In the early stages, people with OCP generally experience chronic or relapsing conjunctivitis that is often characterized by tearing, irritation, burning, and/or mucus drainage. If left untreated, OCP can progress to severe conjunctiva scarring and vision loss. Involvement of other mucosal sites and the skin may also occur in OCP. The exact underlying cause is currently unknown. The treatment of OCP aims to slow disease progression and prevent complications. This usually involves long-term use of medications called immunomodulators which help regulate or normalize the immune system.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004484-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal blistering of the skin 90% Autoimmunity 90% Inflammatory abnormality of the eye 90% Abnormality of reproductive system physiology 50% Atypical scarring of skin 50% Gingivitis 50% Opacification of the corneal stroma 7.5% Visual impairment 7.5% Abnormality of the eye - Autosomal dominant inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
