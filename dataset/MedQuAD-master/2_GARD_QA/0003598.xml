			<Question qid="0003598-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Limb dystonia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Limb dystonia is characterized by excessive pulling of the muscles of a limb, such as the hand or foot. The arm or leg might also be involved. Specific symptoms depend on the combinations of muscles involved and how hard each one is pulling. Mild forms may be expressed as stiffness or soreness of a limb; more moderate forms are characterized by unwanted movements or postures; and in severe forms, abnormal postures may become fixed. Common examples of limb dystonia include writer&apos;s cramp and musician&apos;s dystonia. In most cases, the cause of limb dystonia remains unknown. Treatment is challenging. Botulinum toxin injection, oral medications, and physical therapy may help some patients.</Answer>
