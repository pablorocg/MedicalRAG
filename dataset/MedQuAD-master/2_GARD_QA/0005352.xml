			<Question qid="0005352-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Reynolds syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Reynolds syndrome is a condition characterized by scleroderma with primary biliary cirrhosis. Scleroderma is mainly limited to CREST syndrome, which includes calcinosis cutis (calcium deposits in the skin), Raynaud&apos;s phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction (acid reflux and decrease in motility in the esophagus), sclerodactyly, and telangiectasis. Diffuse scleroderma, or scleroderma that affects blood vessels, internal organs, and the skin, has also been reported. Although generally considered an autoimmune disorder, other causes have been suggested, including genetics. Reynolds syndrome may be caused by mutations in the LBR gene and inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0005352-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Reynolds syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Reynolds syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Reynolds syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the gastric mucosa 90% Hepatomegaly 90% Myalgia 90% Pruritus 90% Abnormality of temperature regulation 50% Acrocyanosis 50% Arthritis 50% Chondrocalcinosis 50% Feeding difficulties in infancy 50% Irregular hyperpigmentation 50% Keratoconjunctivitis sicca 50% Lack of skin elasticity 50% Mucosal telangiectasiae 50% Skin rash 50% Skin ulcer 50% Telangiectasia of the skin 50% Xerostomia 50% Ascites 7.5% Cirrhosis 7.5% Encephalitis 7.5% Lichenification 7.5% Respiratory insufficiency 7.5% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Biliary cirrhosis - Calcinosis - Elevated alkaline phosphatase - Elevated hepatic transaminases - Gastrointestinal hemorrhage - Hyperbilirubinemia - Jaundice - Lip telangiectasia - Palmar telangiectasia - Sclerodactyly - Splenomegaly - Steatorrhea - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
