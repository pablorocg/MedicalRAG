			<Question qid="0003317-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Junctional epidermolysis bullosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is a type of Epidermolysis Bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily.  JEB is separated into two categories: the Herlitz type and the Non-Herlitz type. The Herlitz type of JEB is very severe, and individuals with this condition often do not survive infancy. The Non-Herlitz type includes several subtypes that cause mild to severe blistering of the skin present at birth or shortly thereafter.   JEB is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. It is caused by mutations in the LAMB3, COL17A1, or LAMC2, and LAMA3 genes.There is no cure for JEB. Treatment is focused on management of blistering and prevention of secondary infections.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003317-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Junctional epidermolysis bullosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Junctional epidermolysis bullosa? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Junctional epidermolysis bullosa. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal blistering of the skin 90% Abnormality of dental enamel 90% Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Abnormality of the toenails 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the skin 90% Abnormality of the stomach 50% Duodenal stenosis 50% Pruritus 50% Subcutaneous hemorrhage 50% Alopecia 7.5% Anemia 7.5% Corneal erosion 7.5% Dehydration 7.5% Finger syndactyly 7.5% Inflammatory abnormality of the eye 7.5% Irregular hyperpigmentation 7.5% Laryngeal cyst 7.5% Limitation of joint mobility 7.5% Nausea and vomiting 7.5% Onycholysis 7.5% Polyhydramnios 7.5% Recurrent urinary tract infections 7.5% Renal insufficiency 7.5% Respiratory insufficiency 7.5% Sepsis 7.5% Skin ulcer 7.5% Toe syndactyly 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
