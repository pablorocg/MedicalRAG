			<Question qid="0005131-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) is a type of non-cancerous breast lesion. It typically affects women in the reproductive age group. The size of the lesion varies, but small microscopic PASH is much more common than larger masses. Microscopic PASH is often an incidental finding in breast biopsies done for other non-cancerous or cancerous lesions. Tumorous PASH presents as a firm, painless breast mass or a dense region on a mammogram.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0005131-2" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Is treatment available for pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH)? Surgical removal of the PASH lesions has been performed in some individuals. A wide margin around the mass may be removed to prevent recurrence. Although PASH lesions often grow over time and may recur, they are neither associated with malignancy (cancer) nor considered to be premalignant (pre-cancerous). According to the medical text, CONN&apos;s Current Therapy 2007, approximately 7 percent of people experience a recurrence of PASH.</Answer>
