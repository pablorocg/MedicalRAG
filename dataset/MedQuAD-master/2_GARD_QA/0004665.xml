			<Question qid="0004665-2" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Ovarian small cell carcinoma ?</Question>
			<Answer>What treatments are available for ovarian small cell carcinoma? Ovarian small cell carcinoma is often treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Radiation therapy may also be used in some cases. Because this tumor is derived from the primitive germ cells (eggs) of the ovary, it is often treated with a chemotherapy regimen similar to what is used to treat ovarian germ cell tumors. Specifically, platinum and etoposide based chemotherapy is typically used to treat ovarian small cell carcinoma.</Answer>
