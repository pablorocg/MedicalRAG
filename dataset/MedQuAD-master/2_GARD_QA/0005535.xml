			<Question qid="0005535-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Selective IgM deficiency ?</Question>
			<Answer>Selective IgM deficiency or &quot;Selective Immunoglobulin M deficiency (SIgMD) is a rare immune disorder that has been reported in association with serious infections, such as bacteremia. The disorder can occur in babies, children, and adults. It is characterized by isolated absence or deficiency of IgM, normal levels of other immunoglobulins and recurrent infections (especially by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenza). The cause is still unclear. The diagnosis includes the isolated deficiency of IgM in the blood and no other immunodeficiency or secondary cause of low IgM. Patients with SIgMD and recurrent infections are managed like other antibody defects and deficiencies. It is suggested to have pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines, prophylactic antibiotics to patients who have recurrent infections and immune globulin replacement.</Answer>
