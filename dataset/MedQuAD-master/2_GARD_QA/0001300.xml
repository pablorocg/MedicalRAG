			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Chromosome 8p23.1 deletion? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Chromosome 8p23.1 deletion. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cognitive impairment 90% Intrauterine growth retardation 90% Abnormality of the nose 50% Abnormality of the palate 50% Abnormality of the pulmonary artery 50% Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 50% Complete atrioventricular canal defect 50% Cryptorchidism 50% Displacement of the external urethral meatus 50% Epicanthus 50% External ear malformation 50% High forehead 50% Microcephaly 50% Narrow forehead 50% Neurological speech impairment 50% Seizures 50% Short neck 50% Short stature 50% Weight loss 50% Abnormality of the aorta 7.5% Abnormality of thumb phalanx 7.5% Congenital diaphragmatic hernia 7.5% Deeply set eye 7.5% Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 7.5% Hypoplastic left heart 7.5% Obesity 7.5% Patent ductus arteriosus 7.5% Preaxial foot polydactyly 7.5% Proximal placement of thumb 7.5% Tetralogy of Fallot 7.5% Transposition of the great arteries 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
