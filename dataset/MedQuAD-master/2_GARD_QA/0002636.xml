			<Question qid="0002636-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Goldberg-Shprintzen megacolon syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Goldberg-Shprintzen megacolon syndrome is a very rare genetic condition characterized by Hirschsprung disease, megacolon, small head, widely spaced eyes, cleft palate, short stature, and learning disability. This condition has been described in about 15 individuals to date. Some of the reported cases also had iris coloboma, hypotonia, epilepsy, and ptosis. One of the described patients had sparse scalp hair, a sloping forehead, sparse eyebrows, broad nasal bridge, large ears, pointed chin, ventricular septal defect, hypospadias, syndactyly between the second and third fingers, and clubfeet. This condition appears to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and was found to be caused by mutations in the KIAA1279 gene.</Answer>

			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Goldberg-Shprintzen megacolon syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Goldberg-Shprintzen megacolon syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Aganglionic megacolon 90% Cleft palate 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Microcephaly 90% Short stature 90% Iris coloboma 50% Muscular hypotonia 50% Ptosis 50% Abnormal hair quantity 7.5% Abnormality of neuronal migration 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the eyebrow 7.5% Cerebral cortical atrophy 7.5% Displacement of the external urethral meatus 7.5% Finger syndactyly 7.5% Hypertelorism 7.5% Macrotia 7.5% Pointed chin 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Sloping forehead 7.5% Ventriculomegaly 7.5% Wide nasal bridge 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Blue sclerae - Bulbous nose - Clinodactyly - Corneal erosion - Corneal ulceration - Highly arched eyebrow - Hypoplasia of the brainstem - Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum - Hypoplasia of the maxilla - Intellectual disability - Low-set ears - Megalocornea - Pachygyria - Polymicrogyria - Prominent nasal bridge - Short neck - Short philtrum - Small hand - Sparse hair - Synophrys - Tapered finger - Telecanthus - Thick eyebrow - Thick vermilion border - Wide intermamillary distance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
