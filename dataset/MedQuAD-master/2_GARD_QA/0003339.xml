			<Question qid="0003339-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Kallmann syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Kallmann syndrome (KS) is a condition characterized primarily by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and absent or diminished sense of smell (anosmia or hyposmia, respectively). HH is present from birth and is due to deficiency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). KS is often diagnosed at puberty due to lack of sexual development, but may be suspected in male infants with undescended testicles or an unusually small penis. Untreated adult males may have decreased bone density and muscle mass; decreased testicular volume; erectile dysfunction; diminished libido; and infertility. Untreated adult females almost always have absent menstruation with normal, little, or no breast development. In rare cases, features may include failure of kidney development (renal agenesis); hearing impairment; cleft lip or palate; and/or dental abnormalities. Most cases of KS are sporadic but some types are familial. The inheritance pattern differs depending on the genetic cause. Treatment includes hormone replacement therapy for sexual development. Fertility can be achieved in most cases.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003339-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Kallmann syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Kallmann syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Kallmann syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the sense of smell 90% Anterior hypopituitarism 90% Decreased fertility 90% Erectile abnormalities 90% Hypoplasia of penis 90% Abnormality of the voice 50% Breast aplasia 50% Cryptorchidism 50% Primary amenorrhea 50% Reduced bone mineral density 50% Abnormality of color vision 7.5% Cleft palate 7.5% Delayed skeletal maturation 7.5% Gait disturbance 7.5% Gynecomastia 7.5% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 7.5% Ichthyosis 7.5% Incoordination 7.5% Muscle weakness 7.5% Muscular hypotonia 7.5% Neurological speech impairment 7.5% Nystagmus 7.5% Obesity 7.5% Pes cavus 7.5% Ptosis 7.5% Recurrent fractures 7.5% Reduced number of teeth 7.5% Renal hypoplasia/aplasia 7.5% Rocker bottom foot 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Sensorineural hearing impairment 7.5% Skeletal dysplasia 7.5% Tremor 7.5% Visual impairment 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003339-3" qtype="inheritance">Is Kallmann syndrome inherited ?</Question>
			<Answer>How is Kallmann syndrome inherited? Kallmann syndrome (KS) may be inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner depending on the gene(s) responsible. For example: KS due to mutations in the KAL1 gene (also called the ANOS1 gene), causing Kallmann syndrome 1, is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. KS due to mutations in the FGFR1, PROKR2, PROK2, CHD7 or FGF8 genes (causing KS types 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively) is predominantly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. KS due to mutations in PROKR2 and PROK2 can also be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In the majority of people with KS, the family history appears to be negative (the condition occurs sporadically). However, affected people are still at risk to pass the disease-causing mutation(s) on to their children, or to have an affected child. The risk for each child to be affected depends on the genetic cause in the affected person and may be up to 50%. People with personal questions about the genetic cause and inheritance of KS are encouraged to speak with a genetic counselor or other genetics professional. The genetic cause in many cases remains unknown, and a thorough family history should be obtained to understand the mode of inheritance in each family and to aid in genetic testing and counseling. Information about specific features present or absent in all family members can help determine the mode of inheritance present.</Answer>
