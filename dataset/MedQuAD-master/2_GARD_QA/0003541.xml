			<Question qid="0003541-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Lennox-Gastaut syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a form of severe epilepsy that begins in childhood. It is characterized by multiple types of seizures and intellectual disability. This condition can be caused by brain malformations, perinatal asphyxia (lack of oxygen), severe head injury, central nervous system infection and inherited degenerative or metabolic conditions. In about one-third of cases, no cause can be found. Treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome includes anti-epileptic medications such as valproate, lamotrigine, felbamate, or topiramate. There is usually no single antiepileptic medication that will control seizures. Children may improve initially, but many later show tolerance to a drug or develop uncontrollable seizures.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003541-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the periventricular white matter - Abnormality of the teeth - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Depressed nasal bridge - Dysphagia - Enlarged cisterna magna - Epileptic encephalopathy - Frontotemporal cerebral atrophy - Gastroesophageal reflux - Generalized myoclonic seizures - Gingival overgrowth - High forehead - Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum - Intellectual disability, progressive - Intellectual disability, severe - Low-set ears - Macrocephaly - Posteriorly rotated ears - Progressive - Ptosis - Recurrent respiratory infections - Tented upper lip vermilion - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
