			<Question qid="0001789-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Dentinogenesis imperfecta type 2 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dentinogenesis imperfecta type 2 is a rare and severe form of dentinogenesis imperfecta, a condition that affects tooth development. People affected by the condition may have weak and discolored teeth. These problems can affect both primary (baby) teeth and permanent teeth. People with this form of dentinogenesis imperfecta have no normal teeth. Sensorineural hearing loss has also been found in some affected people. Dentinogenesis imperfecta type 2 is caused by changes (mutations) in the DSPP gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment is usually focused on protecting primary (baby) and then permanent teeth with preformed pediatric crowns and other interventions. The replacement of teeth might be considered in the future with dentures and/or implants.</Answer>
