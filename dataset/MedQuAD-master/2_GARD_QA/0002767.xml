			<Question qid="0002767-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Hemochromatosis type 1 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hemochromatosis type 1 is a disease in which too much iron builds up in the body.  This extra iron is toxic to the body and can damage the organs. Hemochromatosis type 1 is the most common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis. Symptoms of this condition typically begin in adulthood. Early symptoms of hemochromatosis are nonspecific and may include fatigue, joint pain, abdominal pain, and loss of sex drive. Later signs and symptoms can include arthritis, liver disease, diabetes, heart abnormalities, and skin discoloration. Hemochromatosis type 1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations in the HFE gene. Hemochromatosis may be aquired or inherited. Hereditary hemochromatosis is classified by type depending on the age of onset and other factors such as genetic cause and mode of inheritance.

			<Question qid="0002767-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Hemochromatosis type 1 ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Hemochromatosis type 1? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hemochromatosis type 1. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal glucose tolerance - Alopecia - Amenorrhea - Arrhythmia - Arthropathy - Ascites - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Azoospermia - Cardiomegaly - Cardiomyopathy - Cirrhosis - Congestive heart failure - Diabetes mellitus - Elevated hepatic transaminases - Hepatocellular carcinoma - Hepatomegaly - Hyperpigmentation of the skin - Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism - Impotence - Increased serum ferritin - Increased serum iron - Osteoporosis - Pleural effusion - Splenomegaly - Telangiectasia - Testicular atrophy - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002767-3" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Hemochromatosis type 1 ?</Question>
			<Answer>How might hemochromatosis type 1 be treated?  Treatment for hemochromatosis might include phlebotomy, iron chelation therapy, dietary changes, and treatment for complications.The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of iron in the body to normal levels, prevent or delay organ damage from excess iron, treat complications of hemochromatosis, and maintain normal amounts of iron throughout the lifetime. Phlebotomy aids in ridding the body of excess iron and maintaining normal iron stores. Most people begin treatment with weekly therapeutic phlebotomy of 500 mL whole blood-although sometimes treatment is initially twice a week. Maintenance phlebotomy usually involves treatment every 2-3 weeks in which 1 unit of blood is removed.
