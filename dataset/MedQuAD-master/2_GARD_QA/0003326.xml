			<Answer>Juvenile ossifying fibroma (JOF) is rare, benign tumor of the craniofacial (skull and face) bones. It is considered a &quot;fibro-osseous neoplasm&quot; because it is characterized by an overgrowth of bone. Affected people generally experience a gradual or rapid, painless expansion of the affected bone or region. Other symptoms such as exophthalmos or nasal blockage can rarely be associated with the tumor depending on its exact location. In some cases, the condition can be particularly aggressive with rapid growth and significant facial disfigurement. Although the condition can affect people of all ages, it is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 5 and 15. The exact underlying cause is currently unknown; however, most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. JOF is usually treated with surgery. Because the recurrence rate of JOF ranges from 30% to 58%, continued follow-up is essential.</Answer>
