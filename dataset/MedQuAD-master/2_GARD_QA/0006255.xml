			<Question qid="0006255-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Type 1 plasminogen deficiency ?</Question>
			<Answer>Type 1 plasminogen deficiency is a genetic condition associated with chronic lesions in the pseudomembrane (tough, thick material) of the mucosa of the eye, mouth, nasopharynx, trachea, and female genital tract; decreased serum plasminogen activity; and decreased plasminogen antigen level. The lesions may be triggered by local injury and/or infection and often recur after removal of the lesion; they are caused by the deposition of fibrin (a protein involved in blood clotting) and by inflammation. The most common clinical finding is ligenous (&apos;wood-like&apos;) conjunctivitis, a condition marked by redness and subsequent formation of pseudomembranes of part of the eye that progresses to white, yellow-white or red thick masses with a wood-like consistency that replace the normal mucosa. Hydrocephalus may be present at birth in a small number of individuals.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0006255-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Type 1 plasminogen deficiency ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Type 1 plasminogen deficiency? Type 1 plasminogen deficiency causes reduced levels of functional plasminogen. The rare inflammatory disease mainly affects the mucous membrances in different body sites. Although the symptoms and their severity may vary from person to person, the most common clinical manifestation is ligneous conjunctivitis, characterized by development of fibrin-rich, woodlike (&apos;ligneous&apos;) pseudomembranous lesions. Involvement of the cornea may result in blindness. Other, less common manifestations are ligenous gingivitis, otitis media, ligneous bronchitis and pneumonia, involvement of the gastrointestinal or female genital tract, juvenile colloid milium of the skin (condition in which clear papules develop on sun-exposed areas of the skin), and congenital hydrocephalus. Although the condition is known to cause thrombotic events in mice, no reports of venous thrombosis in humans with the condition have been documented.[826] The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Type 1 plasminogen deficiency. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the eye 90% Abnormality of the oral cavity 50% Abnormality of the intestine 7.5% Abnormality of the middle ear 7.5% Abnormality of the respiratory system 7.5% Dandy-Walker malformation 7.5% Hydrocephalus 7.5% Nephrolithiasis 7.5% Polycystic ovaries 7.5% Nephritis 5% Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - Abnormality of the cardiovascular system - Abnormality of the ear - Abnormality of the larynx - Abnormality of the skin - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Blindness - Cerebellar hypoplasia - Conjunctivitis - Duodenal ulcer - Gingival overgrowth - Gingivitis - Infantile onset - Macrocephaly - Periodontitis - Recurrent upper respiratory tract infections - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0006255-3" qtype="causes">What causes Type 1 plasminogen deficiency ?</Question>
			<Answer>What causes plasminogen deficiency, type 1? Plasminogen deficiency, type 1 is caused by a mutation in a gene encoding plasminogen, an enzyme whose function is to dissolve fibrin clots. Fibrin clots form scabs at a wound site.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0006255-4" qtype="inheritance">Is Type 1 plasminogen deficiency inherited ?</Question>
			<Answer>Is plasminogen deficiency, type 1 inherited? If so, in what manner? Plasminogen deficiency, type 1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, which means that an individual must inherit two disease-causing mutated copies of the plasminogen gene in order to have the condition and exhibit symptoms.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0006255-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Type 1 plasminogen deficiency ?</Question>
			<Answer>How might type 1 plasminogen deficiency be treated? The treatment options available for type 1 plasminogen deficiency are few. However, some researchers have shown that the ligneous lesions can be reversed by plasminogen infusion, with changes occurring within 3 days and restored to normal after 2 weeks of treatment. Recurrence has been prevented by daily injections with plasminogen sufficient to achieve plasma concentrations to approximately 40% of the normal amount of plasminogen. Treatment with topical plasminogen has also been successful and resulted in dramatic improvement and complete resolution of the membranes. In some women, treatment with oral contraceptives have resulted in an increase in the levels of plasminogen and some resolution of the pseudomembrane.</Answer>
