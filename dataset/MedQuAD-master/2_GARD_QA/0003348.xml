			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Kaplan Plauchu Fitch syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Kaplan Plauchu Fitch syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 90% Abnormality of periauricular region 90% Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Abnormality of the metacarpal bones 90% Abnormality of the toenails 90% Anteverted nares 90% Cleft palate 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Prominent nasal bridge 90% Proptosis 90% Ptosis 90% Short distal phalanx of finger 90% Short philtrum 90% Short stature 90% Tapered finger 90% Telecanthus 90% Triphalangeal thumb 90% Abnormality of the hip bone 50% Advanced eruption of teeth 50% Choanal atresia 50% Conductive hearing impairment 50% Craniosynostosis 50% Genu valgum 50% Hypertelorism 50% Lacrimation abnormality 50% Microcephaly 50% Myopia 50% Pectus excavatum 50% Sensorineural hearing impairment 50% Sloping forehead 50% Spina bifida occulta 50% Ulnar deviation of finger 50% Abnormal auditory evoked potentials - Abnormality of the vertebral column - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Hypotelorism - Oxycephaly - Preauricular pit - Short 1st metacarpal - Short first metatarsal - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
