			<Question qid="0003549-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis is a skeletal dysplasia characterized by short stature and an abnormality of the wrist bones called Madelung deformity. Short stature is present from birth due to shortening of the long bones in the legs. Madelung deformity typically develops during mid-to-late childhood and may progress during puberty. People with this condition often experience pain in their wrists or arms. The severity of Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis varies among affected individuals, although the signs and symptoms of this condition are generally more severe in females. Other features of Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis can include increased muscle size, bowing of a bone in the leg called the tibia, elbow abnormalities, scoliosis, and high-arched palate. Intelligence is not affected by this condition. Most cases of Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis are caused by mutations in or near the SHOX gene. The cause of the disorder remains unknown in those cases not related to the SHOX gene. Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis follows a pseudoautosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003549-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the femur 90% Abnormality of the hip bone 90% Abnormality of the humeroulnar joint 90% Abnormality of the humerus 90% Abnormality of the metacarpal bones 90% Abnormality of the metaphyses 90% Abnormality of the tibia 90% Abnormality of the ulna 90% Anonychia 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the radius 90% Aplastic/hypoplastic toenail 90% Arthralgia 90% Bone pain 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 90% Cone-shaped epiphysis 90% Depressed nasal bridge 90% Exostoses 90% Genu varum 90% Limitation of joint mobility 90% Madelung deformity 90% Micromelia 90% Patellar aplasia 90% Short stature 90% Abnormality of calvarial morphology 50% Elbow dislocation 50% Genu valgum 50% Osteoarthritis 50% Scoliosis 50% Nephropathy 7.5% Abnormality of the carpal bones - Abnormality of the metatarsal bones - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Coxa valga - Disproportionate short-limb short stature - Dorsal subluxation of ulna - Fibular hypoplasia - High palate - Hypoplasia of the radius - Hypoplasia of the ulna - Increased carrying angle - Limited elbow movement - Limited wrist movement - Mesomelia - Multiple exostoses - Radial bowing - Short 4th metacarpal - Short tibia - Short toe - Skeletal muscle hypertrophy - Tibial bowing - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
