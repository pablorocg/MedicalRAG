			<Question qid="0002107-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that is characterized by both arthritis and inflammation of an enthesitis site (the point at which a ligament, tendon, or joint capsule attaches to the bone). Signs and symptoms generally develop in late childhood or early adolescence and include pain, tenderness, and swelling in joints and at the enthesis. The knee and the back of the ankle (at the Achilles tendon) are the most commonly affected parts of the body. The underlying cause of enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis is currently unknown (idiopathic). It is very rare for more than one member of a family to have juvenile arthritis; however, research suggests that having a family member with juvenile arthritis or any autoimmune disease may increase the risk of having juvenile arthritis, in general. Treatment usually involves different types of medications to help manage symptoms and/or physical therapy.</Answer>

			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Arthritis 90% Inflammatory abnormality of the eye 90% Joint swelling 90% Abnormality of the teeth 50% Cartilage destruction 50% Enthesitis 50% Abnormal tendon morphology 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
