			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Renal hamartomas nephroblastomatosis and fetal gigantism? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Renal hamartomas nephroblastomatosis and fetal gigantism. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the philtrum 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Deeply set eye 90% Hepatomegaly 90% High forehead 90% Macrocephaly 90% Muscular hypotonia 90% Open mouth 90% Round face 90% Short nose 90% Tall stature 90% Wide nasal bridge 90% Abnormality of the palate 50% Abnormality of the pancreas 50% Anteverted nares 50% Broad alveolar ridges 50% Cryptorchidism 50% Epicanthus 50% Hyperinsulinemia 50% Hypoplasia of penis 50% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 50% Nephroblastoma (Wilms tumor) 50% Polyhydramnios 50% Thickened helices 50% Dolichocephaly 7.5% Hernia of the abdominal wall 7.5% Ptosis 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Single transverse palmar crease 7.5% Abnormal facial shape - Agenesis of corpus callosum - Ascites - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Congenital diaphragmatic hernia - Depressed nasal bridge - Distal ileal atresia - Edema - Hypoplasia of the abdominal wall musculature - Interrupted aortic arch - Large for gestational age - Long upper lip - Low-set ears - Nephroblastomatosis - Nephrogenic rest - Pancreatic islet-cell hyperplasia - Renal hamartoma - Tented upper lip vermilion - Visceromegaly - Volvulus - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
