			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Fucosidosis type 1? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Fucosidosis type 1. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Coarse facial features 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Frontal bossing 90% Hearing impairment 90% Hepatomegaly 90% Hyperhidrosis 90% Hyperkeratosis 90% Hypothyroidism 90% Kyphosis 90% Lipoatrophy 90% Mucopolysacchariduria 90% Skeletal dysplasia 90% Abnormality of the gallbladder 50% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 50% Hypertonia 50% Muscular hypotonia 50% Opacification of the corneal stroma 50% Recurrent respiratory infections 50% Seizures 50% Skeletal muscle atrophy 50% Splenomegaly 50% Abnormal pyramidal signs 7.5% Abnormality of the nail 7.5% Abnormality of the teeth 7.5% Acrocyanosis 7.5% Cardiomegaly 7.5% Abnormality of the abdominal wall - Absent/hypoplastic coccyx - Absent/hypoplastic paranasal sinuses - Angiokeratoma - Anhidrosis - Anterior beaking of lumbar vertebrae - Anterior beaking of thoracic vertebrae - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Barrel-shaped chest - Cerebral atrophy - Cervical platyspondyly - Coxa valga - Dry skin - Dysostosis multiplex - Elevated sweat chloride - Flexion contracture - Hernia - Hypertelorism - Intellectual disability - Lumbar hyperlordosis - Macroglossia - Oligosacchariduria - Polyneuropathy - Prominent forehead - Scoliosis - Shield chest - Short stature - Spastic tetraplegia - Thick eyebrow - Thick lower lip vermilion - Tortuosity of conjunctival vessels - Vacuolated lymphocytes - Wide nose - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
