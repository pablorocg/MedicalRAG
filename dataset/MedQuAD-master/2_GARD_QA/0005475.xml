			<Question qid="0005475-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Satoyoshi syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Satoyoshi syndrome is a rare condition characterized by progressive, painful, intermittent muscle spasms, diarrhea or unusual malabsorption, amenorrhea, alopecia universalis, short stature, and skeletal abnormalities. Progressive painful intermittent muscle spasms usually start between 6 to 15 years of age. Alopecia universalis also appears around age 10. About half of affected individuals experience malabsorption, specifically of carbohydrates. The skeletal abnormalities may be secondary to muscle spasms. The main endocrine disorder is primary amenorrhea. All cases have apparently been sporadic, even when occurring in large families. The exact cause is unknown; but some researchers have speculated that Satoyoshi syndrome is an autoimmune disorder.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0005475-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Satoyoshi syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Satoyoshi syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Satoyoshi syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of epiphysis morphology 90% Abnormality of the eyelashes 90% Abnormality of the femur 90% Abnormality of the hip bone 90% Abnormality of the humerus 90% Abnormality of the metaphyses 90% Abnormality of the wrist 90% Genu varum 90% Hyperlordosis 90% Limb undergrowth 90% Microcephaly 90% Polycystic ovaries 90% Secondary amenorrhea 90% Short stature 90% Tapered finger 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 5% Short metacarpal 5% Short metatarsal 5% Alopecia universalis - Amenorrhea - Diarrhea - Genu valgum - Hypoplasia of the uterus - Malabsorption - Mildly elevated creatine phosphokinase - Osteolytic defects of the phalanges of the hand - Pes planus - Skeletal muscle hypertrophy - Sporadic - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
