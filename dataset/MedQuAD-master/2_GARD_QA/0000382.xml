			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Anonychia-onychodystrophy with hypoplasia or absence of distal phalanges? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Anonychia-onychodystrophy with hypoplasia or absence of distal phalanges. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Anonychia 90% Aplastic/hypoplastic toenail 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Split hand 90% Triphalangeal thumb 90% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Complete duplication of thumb phalanx - High palate - Nail dysplasia - Nail dystrophy - Prominent nasal bridge - Prominent nose - Short 5th finger - Short philtrum - Shortening of all distal phalanges of the fingers - Shortening of all distal phalanges of the toes - Underdeveloped nasal alae - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
