			<Question qid="0004972-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 (PCH2) is a rare condition that affects the development of the brain. Signs and symptoms vary but may include microcephaly, developmental delay with lack of voluntary motor development, intellectual disability and movement disorders (i.e. chorea, dystonia, and spasticity). Affected people may also experience dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), impaired vision, seizures and an inability to communicate. Children with this condition often pass away prior to age 10 years, although survival beyond age 20 years has been reported. PCH2 is caused by changes (mutations) in the TSEN54, TSEN2, TSEN34, or SEPSECS gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004972-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Death in childhood 7.5% Cerebral atrophy 5% Cerebral cortical atrophy 5% Cortical gyral simplification 5% Ventriculomegaly 5% Abnormality of the periventricular white matter - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Babinski sign - Cerebellar hemisphere hypoplasia - Cerebellar hypoplasia - Cerebellar vermis hypoplasia - Chorea - Clonus - Congenital onset - Dystonia - Extrapyramidal dyskinesia - Feeding difficulties - Gliosis - Hypoplasia of the brainstem - Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum - Hypoplasia of the pons - Impaired smooth pursuit - Limb hypertonia - Microcephaly - Muscular hypotonia of the trunk - Opisthotonus - Poor suck - Progressive microcephaly - Restlessness - Seizures - Severe global developmental delay - Sloping forehead - Visual impairment - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
