			<Question qid="0004163-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA ?</Question>
			<Answer>Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA, also called Morquio syndrome, type A) is a metabolic condition that primarily affects the skeleton. The severity, age of onset, and associated symptoms vary significantly from person to person and range from a severe and rapidly progressive, early-onset form to a slowly progressive, later-onset form. The severe form is usually diagnosed between ages 1 and 3, while the milder form may not become evident until late childhood or adolescence. Signs and symptoms include various skeletal abnormalities such as short stature, knock knees, pectus carinatum, and malformations of the spine, hips and wrists. Affected people may also experience involvement of other organ systems such as respiratory problems, valvular heart disease, hearing impairment, corneal clouding, dental abnormalities, hepatomegaly, and spinal cord compression. MPS IVA is caused by changes (mutations) in the GALNS gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004163-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of epiphysis morphology 90% Abnormality of the metaphyses 90% Abnormality of the ribs 90% Delayed skeletal maturation 90% Gait disturbance 90% Genu valgum 90% Hearing impairment 90% Joint hypermobility 90% Mucopolysacchariduria 90% Opacification of the corneal stroma 90% Pectus carinatum 90% Reduced bone mineral density 90% Short neck 90% Short stature 90% Short thorax 90% Abnormality of dental enamel 50% Abnormality of the heart valves 50% Abnormality of the hip bone 50% Anteverted nares 50% Carious teeth 50% Coarse facial features 50% Hernia 50% Hyperlordosis 50% Joint dislocation 50% Kyphosis 50% Platyspondyly 50% Scoliosis 50% Spinal canal stenosis 50% Wide mouth 50% Cognitive impairment 7.5% Macrocephaly 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cervical myelopathy - Cervical subluxation - Chondroitin sulfate excretion in urine - Constricted iliac wings - Coxa valga - Disproportionate short-trunk short stature - Epiphyseal deformities of tubular bones - Flaring of rib cage - Grayish enamel - Hepatomegaly - Hypoplasia of the odontoid process - Inguinal hernia - Joint laxity - Juvenile onset - Keratan sulfate excretion in urine - Mandibular prognathia - Metaphyseal widening - Osteoporosis - Ovoid vertebral bodies - Pointed proximal second through fifth metacarpals - Prominent sternum - Recurrent upper respiratory tract infections - Restrictive lung disease - Ulnar deviation of the wrist - Widely spaced teeth - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
