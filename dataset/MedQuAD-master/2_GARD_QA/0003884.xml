			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Megalocornea-intellectual disability syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Megalocornea-intellectual disability syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of immune system physiology 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Frontal bossing 90% Megalocornea 90% Muscular hypotonia 90% Neurological speech impairment 90% Abnormality of the anterior chamber 50% Abnormality of the palate 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the iris 50% Epicanthus 50% Genu varum 50% Hypertelorism 50% Joint hypermobility 50% Kyphosis 50% Myopia 50% Open mouth 50% Scoliosis 50% Seizures 50% Short stature 50% Stereotypic behavior 50% Talipes 50% Tapered finger 50% Wide nasal bridge 50% Abnormality of lipid metabolism 7.5% Abnormality of the pinna 7.5% Astigmatism 7.5% EEG abnormality 7.5% Hypothyroidism 7.5% Incoordination 7.5% Macrocephaly 7.5% Microcephaly 7.5% Nystagmus 7.5% Reduced bone mineral density 7.5% Sensorineural hearing impairment 7.5% Short philtrum 7.5% Underdeveloped supraorbital ridges 7.5% Hypercholesterolemia 5% Osteopenia 5% Arachnodactyly - Ataxia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cupped ear - Delayed CNS myelination - Depressed nasal bridge - Dysphagia - Genu recurvatum - Genu valgum - High palate - Hypoplasia of the iris - Intellectual disability - Iridodonesis - Large fleshy ears - Long philtrum - Low anterior hairline - Pes planus - Poor coordination - Primary hypothyroidism - Round face - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
