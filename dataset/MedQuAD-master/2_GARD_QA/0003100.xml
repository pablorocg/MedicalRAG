			<Question qid="0003100-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome (HLTS) is a rare condition that, as the name suggests, is associated with sparse hair (hypotrichosis), lymphedema, and telangiectasia, particularly on the palms of the hands. Symptoms usually begin at birth or in early childhood and become worse over time. HLTS is thought to be caused by changes (mutations) in the SOX18 gene. It can follow both an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, depending on the affected family. There is currently no cure for the condition. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003100-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Alopecia 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the eyebrow 90% Edema of the lower limbs 90% Lymphangioma 90% Abnormality of the eye 50% Cutis marmorata 50% Periorbital edema 50% Vaginal hernia 50% Venous insufficiency 50% Abnormality of the peritoneum 7.5% Abnormality of the pleura 7.5% Hydrops fetalis 7.5% Abnormality of the nail - Abnormality of the teeth - Absent eyebrow - Absent eyelashes - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Hydrocele testis - Hypotrichosis - Nonimmune hydrops fetalis - Palmar telangiectasia - Predominantly lower limb lymphedema - Thin skin - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
