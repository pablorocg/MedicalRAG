			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the oral cavity 90% Anorexia 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Feeding difficulties in infancy 90% Hydrocephalus 90% Megaloblastic anemia 90% Microcephaly 90% Muscular hypotonia 90% Pallor 90% Reduced consciousness/confusion 90% Retinopathy 90% Seizures 90% Behavioral abnormality 50% Gait disturbance 50% Infantile onset 50% Skin rash 7.5% Abnormality of extrapyramidal motor function - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cerebral cortical atrophy - Confusion - Cystathioninemia - Cystathioninuria - Decreased adenosylcobalamin - Decreased methionine synthase activity - Decreased methylcobalamin - Decreased methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity - Dementia - Failure to thrive - Hematuria - Hemolytic-uremic syndrome - High forehead - Homocystinuria - Hyperhomocystinemia - Hypomethioninemia - Intellectual disability - Lethargy - Long face - Low-set ears - Macrotia - Metabolic acidosis - Methylmalonic acidemia - Methylmalonic aciduria - Nephropathy - Neutropenia - Nystagmus - Pigmentary retinopathy - Proteinuria - Reduced visual acuity - Renal insufficiency - Smooth philtrum - Thrombocytopenia - Thromboembolism - Tremor - Visual impairment - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
