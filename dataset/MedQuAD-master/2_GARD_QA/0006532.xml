			<Question qid="0006532-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Yellow nail syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Yellow nail syndrome is characterized by yellow nails that lack a cuticle, grow slowly, and are loose or detached (onycholysis). Yellow nail syndrome is often associated with diseases of the lung or lymphedema.  Yellow nail syndrome often affects older adults, though it can occur at any age.  While the exact cause of this condition is unknown, it has been shown to run in some families, which suggests that there may be a genetic component in some cases.  Unfortunately, there is no cure for this condition, but there are therapies available to treat the related lung diseases and lymphedema.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0006532-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Yellow nail syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Yellow nail syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Yellow nail syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of nail color 90% Abnormality of the bronchi 90% Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Abnormality of the toenails 90% Lymphedema 90% Abnormality of the pleura 50% Recurrent respiratory infections 50% Respiratory insufficiency 50% Sinusitis 50% Neoplasm 7.5% Abnormality of the musculature - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Hypoplasia of lymphatic vessels - Predominantly lower limb lymphedema - Slow-growing nails - Yellow nails - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0006532-3" qtype="causes">What causes Yellow nail syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Has a genetic cause of familial yellow nail syndrome been discovered? The exact cause of yellow nail syndrome remains unclear.  There have been reports of several members in the same family being affected with this condition and also reports of children being affected at young ages.  These reports have been used to suggest the possibility a genetic component to yellow nail syndrome.  However, the possibility of a genetic cause for yellow nail syndrome remains a subject of debate, as most cases of this condition occur by chance in individuals who do not have a family history of this condition.  Unfortunately, because there are so few cases of familial yellow nail syndrome, there is limited information and currently no known research about possible genetic causes.</Answer>
