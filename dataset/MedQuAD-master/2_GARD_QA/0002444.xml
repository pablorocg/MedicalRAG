			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Frontofacionasal dysplasia? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Frontofacionasal dysplasia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Aplasia/Hypoplasia involving the nose 90% Blepharophimosis 90% Broad forehead 90% Cleft eyelid 90% Depressed nasal bridge 90% Depressed nasal ridge 90% Facial cleft 90% Hypertelorism 90% Malar flattening 90% Non-midline cleft lip 90% Ptosis 90% Short nose 90% Short stature 90% Telecanthus 90% Abnormality of calvarial morphology 50% Abnormality of the eyelashes 50% Abnormality of the sense of smell 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the eyebrow 50% Cleft palate 50% Encephalocele 50% Epibulbar dermoid 50% Facial asymmetry 50% Iris coloboma 50% Midline defect of the nose 50% Preauricular skin tag 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia affecting the eye 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum 7.5% Cataract 7.5% Choanal atresia 7.5% Microcornea 7.5% Sacrococcygeal pilonidal abnormality 7.5% Absent inner eyelashes - Ankyloblepharon - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bifid nose - Bifid uvula - Brachycephaly - Cranium bifidum occultum - Frontal cutaneous lipoma - Hypoplasia of midface - Hypoplasia of the frontal bone - Microphthalmia - Oral cleft - S-shaped palpebral fissures - Underdeveloped nasal alae - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
