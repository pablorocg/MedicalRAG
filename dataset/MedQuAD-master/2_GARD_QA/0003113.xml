			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Ichthyosis follicularis atrichia photophobia syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Ichthyosis follicularis atrichia photophobia syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Alopecia 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Cryptorchidism 90% Dry skin 90% Hydrocephalus 90% Ichthyosis 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Microcephaly 90% Optic atrophy 90% Photophobia 90% Renal hypoplasia/aplasia 90% Seizures 90% Abnormality of the fingernails 50% Aganglionic megacolon 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia affecting the eye 50% Cleft palate 50% Convex nasal ridge 50% Developmental regression 50% Eczema 50% Hearing impairment 50% Hypohidrosis 50% Intrauterine growth retardation 50% Iris coloboma 50% Multicystic kidney dysplasia 50% Plagiocephaly 50% Postaxial hand polydactyly 50% Recurrent respiratory infections 50% Scoliosis 50% Vertebral segmentation defect 50% Vesicoureteral reflux 50% Abnormality of dental enamel 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the cerebellum 7.5% Astigmatism 7.5% Camptodactyly of finger 7.5% Cataract 7.5% Cerebral cortical atrophy 7.5% Cheilitis 7.5% Choanal atresia 7.5% Delayed skeletal maturation 7.5% Frontal bossing 7.5% Inflammatory abnormality of the eye 7.5% Kyphosis 7.5% Macrotia 7.5% Muscular hypotonia 7.5% Myopia 7.5% Nystagmus 7.5% Omphalocele 7.5% Opacification of the corneal stroma 7.5% Platyspondyly 7.5% Short stature 7.5% Split hand 7.5% Urticaria 7.5% Hip dislocation 5% Abnormality of the ribs - Abnormality of the vertebrae - Absent eyebrow - Absent eyelashes - Brain atrophy - Congenital onset - Ectodermal dysplasia - Erythroderma - Follicular hyperkeratosis - Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum - Inguinal hernia - Intellectual disability - Nail dysplasia - Nail dystrophy - Oligohydramnios - Olivopontocerebellar atrophy - Recurrent corneal erosions - Renal dysplasia - Scaling skin - Umbilical hernia - Unilateral chest hypoplasia - Unilateral renal agenesis - Variable expressivity - Ventriculomegaly - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
