			<Question qid="0005683-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Snyder-Robinson syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Snyder-Robinson syndrome is an inherited condition that is characterized by intellectual disability, muscle and bone abnormalities, and other problems with development. It only occurs in males. Affected individuals have delayed development that begins in early childhood. Speech difficulties are common. Low muscle tone (hypotonia) and muscle mass leads to difficulty walking and an unsteady gait. Other features include thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), an abnormal curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis), and unusual facial features including a prominent lower lip, cleft palate, and facial asymmetry. Snyder-Robinson syndrome is caused by mutations in the SMS gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0005683-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Snyder-Robinson syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Snyder-Robinson syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Snyder-Robinson syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the pinna - Bifid uvula - Broad-based gait - Cleft palate - Cryptorchidism - Decreased muscle mass - Dental crowding - Dysarthria - Facial asymmetry - High, narrow palate - Hyperextensibility of the finger joints - Hypertelorism - Intellectual disability - Kyphoscoliosis - Long fingers - Long hallux - Long palm - Mandibular prognathia - Muscular hypotonia - Narrow palm - Nasal speech - Osteoporosis - Pectus carinatum - Pectus excavatum - Phenotypic variability - Recurrent fractures - Seizures - Severe Myopia - Short philtrum - Short stature - Talipes equinovarus - Tall stature - Thick lower lip vermilion - Webbed neck - Wide intermamillary distance - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
