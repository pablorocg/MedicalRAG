			<Question qid="0000623-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Barber Say syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Barber Say syndrome is a very rare condition characterized by the association of excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis), papery thin and fragile (atrophic) skin, outward turned eyelids (ectropion) and a large mouth (macrostomia). It has been described in less than 20 patients in the medical literature. Barber Say syndrome has a variable presentation, with reports of both mild and severe cases. Inheritance has been debated, with qualities suggestive of autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive. A recent study suggests that at least some cases of Barber Say syndrome are caused by dominant mutations in the TWIST2 gene. Treatment remains a challenge for both patients and doctors, and requires a multidisciplinary approach.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000623-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Barber Say syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Barber Say syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Barber Say syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the eyelashes 90% Anteverted nares 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the eyebrow 90% Cutis laxa 90% Delayed eruption of teeth 90% Hearing abnormality 90% Hypertelorism 90% Hypertrichosis 90% Telecanthus 90% Wide mouth 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the nipples 50% Breast aplasia 50% Hyperextensible skin 50% Atresia of the external auditory canal 7.5% External ear malformation 7.5% Shawl scrotum 7.5% High palate 5% Intellectual disability 5% Abnormality of female external genitalia - Abnormality of male external genitalia - Abnormality of the pinna - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Bulbous nose - Dermal atrophy - Dry skin - Ectropion - Hearing impairment - Hypoplastic nipples - Low-set ears - Mandibular prognathia - Redundant skin - Sparse eyebrow - Thin vermilion border - Underdeveloped nasal alae - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
