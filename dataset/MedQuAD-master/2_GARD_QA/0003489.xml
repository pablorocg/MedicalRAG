			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Lateral meningocele syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lateral meningocele syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Atresia of the external auditory canal 90% Conductive hearing impairment 90% Dolichocephaly 90% Dural ectasia 90% Hypoplasia of the zygomatic bone 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Meningocele 90% Narrow face 90% Ptosis 90% Wormian bones 90% Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 50% Abnormality of the teeth 50% Craniofacial hyperostosis 50% Joint hypermobility 50% Low posterior hairline 50% Pectus excavatum 50% Prominent metopic ridge 50% Scoliosis 50% Short neck 50% Short stature 50% Umbilical hernia 50% Arnold-Chiari malformation 7.5% Cleft palate 7.5% Cognitive impairment 7.5% Cryptorchidism 7.5% Epicanthus 7.5% Hyperlordosis 7.5% Hypertelorism 7.5% Iris coloboma 7.5% Kyphosis 7.5% Muscular hypotonia 7.5% Proptosis 7.5% Sensorineural hearing impairment 7.5% Syringomyelia 7.5% Ventricular septal defect 7.5% Abnormality of the middle ear ossicles - Abnormality of the rib cage - Abnormality of the skin - Arachnoid cyst - Arnold-Chiari type I malformation - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Biconcave vertebral bodies - Dental crowding - High palate - Inguinal hernia - Long philtrum - Low-set ears - Malar flattening - Patent ductus arteriosus - Platybasia - Posteriorly rotated ears - Sclerosis of skull base - Short nasal bridge - Smooth philtrum - Vertebral fusion - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
