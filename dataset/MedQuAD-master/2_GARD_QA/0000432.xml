			<Answer>Apocrine carcinoma is a cancer of a sweat gland.  Apocrine carcionoma most often develops under the arm (the axilla), but it can develop on the scalp or other parts of the body.  The cause of apocrine carcinoma is unknown.  Apocrine carcinoma usually appears as a single, small, painless bump (nodule) that can vary in color and slowly increases in size.  The average age at the time of diagnosis is 62 years of age, and twice as many men are affected than women.  Most apocrine carcinomas can be treated and are not fatal.  Treatment of apocrine carcinoma is surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible.  Additional treatments such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy have been used to treat this condition, but the usefulness of these treatments is unproven.</Answer>
