			<Question qid="0003182-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Inclusion body myositis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is an inflammatory myopathy that is characterized by chronic, progressive muscle inflammation and muscle weakness. Symptoms usually begin after the age of 50, although the condition can occur earlier. The onset of muscle weakness usually occurs over months or years. This condition affects both the proximal (close to the trunk of the body) and distal (further away from the trunk) muscles. There is currently no effective treatment for IBM. The cause is unclear in most cases, but it can sometimes be inherited.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003182-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Inclusion body myositis ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Inclusion body myositis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Inclusion body myositis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autoimmunity 90% EMG abnormality 90% Skeletal muscle atrophy 90% Feeding difficulties in infancy 50% Myalgia 7.5% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Dysphagia - Hyporeflexia - Inflammatory myopathy - Phenotypic variability - Proximal muscle weakness - Rimmed vacuoles - Slow progression - Sporadic - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
