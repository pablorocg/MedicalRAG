			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Hunter Rudd Hoffmann syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hunter Rudd Hoffmann syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal dermatoglyphics 90% Abnormality of the distal phalanx of finger 90% Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Abnormality of the toenails 90% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Convex nasal ridge 90% Craniosynostosis 90% Epicanthus 90% Hypotelorism 90% Intrauterine growth retardation 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Narrow forehead 90% Prominent metopic ridge 90% Ptosis 90% Short stature 90% Trigonocephaly 90% Underdeveloped supraorbital ridges 90% Wide mouth 90% Wide nasal bridge 90% Abnormality of the palate 7.5% EEG abnormality 7.5% Hernia of the abdominal wall 7.5% Proptosis 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Ventricular septal defect 7.5% Broad secondary alveolar ridge - High palate - Inguinal hernia - Intellectual disability - Lambdoidal craniosynostosis - Low-set ears - Posteriorly rotated ears - Premature posterior fontanelle closure - Sagittal craniosynostosis - Small anterior fontanelle - Small for gestational age - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
