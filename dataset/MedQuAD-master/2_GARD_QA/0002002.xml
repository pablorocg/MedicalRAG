			<Question qid="0002002-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is one of the major forms of epidermolysis bullosa. The signs and symptoms can vary widely among affected people. In mild cases, blistering may primarily affect the hands, feet, knees, and elbows. Severe cases often involve widespread blistering that can lead to vision loss, disfigurement, and other serious medical problems. DEB is caused by changes (mutations) in the COL7A1 gene and may be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner depending on the subtype. New blisters should be lanced, drained, and protected. Some patients need nutritional support, supplements, occupational therapy and/or surgery depending on the associated features of the disease.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002002-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal blistering of the skin 90% Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Abnormality of the toenails 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the skin 90% Cheilitis 90% Abnormality of dental enamel 50% Abnormality of the hand 50% Abnormality of the larynx 50% Anonychia 50% Camptodactyly of toe 50% Carious teeth 50% Constipation 50% Feeding difficulties in infancy 50% Finger syndactyly 50% Furrowed tongue 50% Gangrene 50% Hypopigmented skin patches 50% Skin ulcer 50% Toe syndactyly 50% Tracheoesophageal fistula 50% Abnormality of the preputium 7.5% Anemia 7.5% Atypical scarring of skin 7.5% Blepharitis 7.5% Cerebral ischemia 7.5% Congestive heart failure 7.5% Corneal erosion 7.5% Eczema 7.5% Glomerulopathy 7.5% Hearing impairment 7.5% Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 7.5% Immunologic hypersensitivity 7.5% Lacrimation abnormality 7.5% Malabsorption 7.5% Neoplasm of the skin 7.5% Nephrotic syndrome 7.5% Otitis media 7.5% Renal insufficiency 7.5% Restrictive lung disease 7.5% Ureteral stenosis 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
