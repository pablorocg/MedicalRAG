			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Abruzzo Erickson syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Abruzzo Erickson syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cleft palate 90% Displacement of the external urethral meatus 90% Hypoplasia of the zygomatic bone 90% Macrotia 90% Malar flattening 90% Chorioretinal coloboma 50% Iris coloboma 50% Radioulnar synostosis 50% Sensorineural hearing impairment 50% Short stature 50% Ulnar deviation of finger 50% Abnormal localization of kidney 7.5% Abnormality of dental morphology 7.5% Atria septal defect 7.5% Brachydactyly syndrome 7.5% Chin dimple 7.5% Conductive hearing impairment 7.5% Cryptorchidism 7.5% Epicanthus 7.5% Microcornea 7.5% Short toe 7.5% Toe syndactyly 7.5% Coloboma - Hearing impairment - Hypospadias - Protruding ear - X-linked inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
