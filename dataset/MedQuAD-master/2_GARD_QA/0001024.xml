			<Answer>A CDKL5-related disorder is a genetic, neuro-developmental condition due to changes (mutations) in the CDKL5 gene. Epileptic encephalopathy (epilepsy accompanied by cognitive and behavioral problems) is the core symptom of a CDKL5-related disorder. Seizures typically begin before 5 months of age. Affected people often have severe intellectual disability with absent speech, and features that resemble Rett syndrome such as hand stereotypies (repetitive movements) and slowed head growth. CDKL5-related disorders have more commonly been reported in females. The inheritance pattern is X-linked dominant. Almost all reported cases have been due to a new mutation in the affected person; one family with 3 affected members has been described. Treatment is symptomatic. In the past, mutations in the CDKL5 gene have been found in people diagnosed with infantile spasms and/or West syndrome; Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; Rett syndrome; a form of atypical Rett syndrome known as the early-onset seizure type; and autism. However, it has more recently been suggested that CDKL5 mutations cause a separate, specific disorder with features that may overlap with these conditions.</Answer>
