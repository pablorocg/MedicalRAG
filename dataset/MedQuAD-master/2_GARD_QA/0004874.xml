			<Question qid="0004874-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Pigmented purpuric eruption ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Pigmented purpuric eruption? Pigmented purpuric eruption is characterized by reddish-brown patches on the skin. These patches result from tiny red dots, sometimes referred to as cayenne pepper spots, which group together to form a flat red patch. Over time, these patches become brown and then slowly fade away, over weeks to months. There have been no systemic symptoms reported with pigmented purpuric eruption. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Pigmented purpuric eruption. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the skin - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Neonatal onset - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
