			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Bone dysplasia lethal Holmgren type? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Bone dysplasia lethal Holmgren type. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the femur 90% Abnormality of the ribs 90% Micromelia 90% Narrow chest 90% Short stature 90% Skeletal dysplasia 90% Weight loss 90% Abnormal diaphysis morphology 50% Abnormality of epiphysis morphology 50% Abnormality of the elbow 50% Abnormality of the metaphyses 50% Abnormality of the thumb 50% Anteverted nares 50% Depressed nasal ridge 50% Frontal bossing 50% Hearing abnormality 50% High forehead 50% Joint dislocation 50% Joint hypermobility 50% Malar flattening 50% Muscular hypotonia 50% Short neck 50% Abnormality of the skin 7.5% Anemia 7.5% Atria septal defect 7.5% Diarrhea 7.5% Hepatomegaly 7.5% Hernia 7.5% Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 7.5% Nausea and vomiting 7.5% Patent ductus arteriosus 7.5% Recurrent respiratory infections 7.5% Respiratory insufficiency 7.5% Talipes 7.5% Thickened nuchal skin fold 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bell-shaped thorax - Short ribs - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
