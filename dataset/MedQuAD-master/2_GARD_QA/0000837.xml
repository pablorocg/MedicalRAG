			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Branchial arch syndrome X-linked? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Branchial arch syndrome X-linked. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the palate 90% Abnormality of the pinna 90% Branchial anomaly 90% Conductive hearing impairment 90% Hypoplasia of the zygomatic bone 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Microcephaly 90% Prominent nasal bridge 90% Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Short stature 90% Triangular face 90% Webbed neck 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the eyebrow 50% Cryptorchidism 50% Epicanthus 50% Abnormality of the mitral valve 7.5% Abnormality of the pulmonary artery 7.5% Abnormality of the pulmonary valve 7.5% Asymmetric growth 7.5% Facial asymmetry 7.5% Pectus excavatum 7.5% Ptosis 7.5% Hearing impairment - High palate - Low-set ears - Protruding ear - Pulmonic stenosis - Specific learning disability - X-linked inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
