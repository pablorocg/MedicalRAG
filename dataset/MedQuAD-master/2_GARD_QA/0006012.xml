			<Question qid="0006012-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Tarsal tunnel syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tarsal tunnel syndrome is a nerve disorder that is characterized by pain in the ankle, foot, and toes. This condition is caused by compression of the posterior tibial nerve, which runs through a canal near the heel into the sole of the foot. When tissues around this nerve become inflamed, they can press on the nerve and cause the pain associated with tarsal tunnel syndrome.</Answer>
