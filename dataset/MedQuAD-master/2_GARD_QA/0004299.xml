			<Question qid="0004299-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Nablus mask-like facial syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nablus mask-like facial syndrome is a rare microdeletion syndrome that is characterized by a mask-like facial appearance. Facial features include narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis); tight appearing glistening facial skin; and flat and broad nose. Other features include malformed ears; unusual scalp hair pattern; permanently bent fingers and toes (camptodactyly); joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement in the hands and feet; unusual dentition; mild developmental delay; undescended testicles in males (cryptorchidism); and a happy disposition. This condition is caused by a deletion at chromosome 8q22.1.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004299-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Nablus mask-like facial syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Nablus mask-like facial syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Nablus mask-like facial syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the antihelix 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the eyebrow 90% Behavioral abnormality 90% Blepharophimosis 90% Cryptorchidism 90% Depressed nasal ridge 90% External ear malformation 90% Highly arched eyebrow 90% Lack of skin elasticity 90% Long philtrum 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Pointed helix 90% Sacrococcygeal pilonidal abnormality 90% Telecanthus 90% Abnormality of dental morphology 50% Abnormality of the nipple 50% Camptodactyly of finger 50% Cognitive impairment 50% Limitation of joint mobility 50% Microcephaly 50% Sandal gap 50% Short neck 50% Abnormal hair quantity 7.5% Abnormality of the eyelashes 7.5% Abnormality of the nares 7.5% Cleft palate 7.5% Craniosynostosis 7.5% Finger syndactyly 7.5% Abnormality of the teeth - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Broad neck - Camptodactyly - Clinodactyly - Depressed nasal bridge - Frontal bossing - Frontal upsweep of hair - Happy demeanor - High palate - Hypertelorism - Hypoplasia of the maxilla - Hypoplastic nipples - Joint contracture of the hand - Labial hypoplasia - Low anterior hairline - Low-set ears - Mask-like facies - Micropenis - Narrow forehead - Narrow mouth - Posteriorly rotated ears - Postnatal microcephaly - Prominent glabella - Retrognathia - Short nose - Short palpebral fissure - Smooth philtrum - Sparse eyebrow - Sparse eyelashes - Sporadic - Tapered finger - Wide nasal bridge - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
