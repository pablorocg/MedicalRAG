			<Answer>Acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR) is a rare condition that affects the eyes. People with this condition may experience a sudden onset of photopsia (the presence of perceived flashes of light) and an area of partial vision loss (a blindspot). Other symptoms may include &quot;whitening of vision&quot; or blurred vision. Although anyone can be affected, the condition is most commonly diagnosed in young women (average age 36.7 years). The underlying cause of AZOOR is currently unknown; however, some researchers have proposed that infectious agents (such as viruses) or autoimmunity may play a role in the development of the condition. No treatment has been proven to improve the visual outcome of AZOOR; however, systemic corticosteroids are the most commonly used therapy.</Answer>
