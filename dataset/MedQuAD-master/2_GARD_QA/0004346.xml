			<Question qid="0004346-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Nephropathic cystinosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cystinosis is an inherited condition in which the body accumulates the amino acid cystine (a building block of proteins) within the cells. Excess cystine forms crystals that can build up and damage cells. These crystals can negatively affect many systems in the body, especially the kidneys and eyes. There are three distinct types of cystinosis: nephropathic cystinosis, intermediate cystinosis, and non-nephropathic or ocular cystinosis. All three types of cystinosis are caused by mutations in the CTNS gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.[1]</Answer>

			<Question qid="0004346-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Nephropathic cystinosis ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Nephropathic cystinosis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Nephropathic cystinosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the voice - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cerebral atrophy - Corneal crystals - Decreased plasma carnitine - Dehydration - Delayed puberty - Delayed skeletal maturation - Diabetes mellitus - Dysphagia - Elevated intracellular cystine - Episodic metabolic acidosis - Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency - Failure to thrive in infancy - Frontal bossing - Generalized aminoaciduria - Genu valgum - Glycosuria - Hepatomegaly - Hypohidrosis - Hyponatremia - Hypophosphatemic rickets - Hypopigmentation of hair - Hypopigmentation of the skin - Male infertility - Metaphyseal widening - Microscopic hematuria - Myopathy - Nephrolithiasis - Photophobia - Pigmentary retinopathy - Polydipsia - Polyuria - Primary hypothyroidism - Progressive neurologic deterioration - Proteinuria - Rachitic rosary - Recurrent corneal erosions - Reduced visual acuity - Renal Fanconi syndrome - Renal insufficiency - Retinal pigment epithelial mottling - Short stature - Skeletal muscle atrophy - Splenomegaly - Visual impairment - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
