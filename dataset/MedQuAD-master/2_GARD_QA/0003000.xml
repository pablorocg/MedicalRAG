			<Question qid="0003000-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is a genetic condition that causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness, usually beginning in infancy or early childhood. Most often, these episodes involve a temporary inability to move muscles in the arms and legs. Episodes tend to increase in frequency until about age 25, after which they may occur less frequently. Factors that can trigger attacks include rest after exercise, potassium-rich foods, stress, fatigue, and long periods without food. Muscle strength improves between attacks, although many affected people continue to experience mild stiffness, particularly in muscles of the face and hands. This condition is caused by mutations in the SCN4A gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003000-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cerebral palsy 90% EMG abnormality 90% Gait disturbance 50% Hyperkalemia 50% Involuntary movements 50% Myalgia 50% Myotonia 50% Arrhythmia 7.5% Bowel incontinence 7.5% Chest pain 7.5% Congestive heart failure 7.5% Feeding difficulties in infancy 7.5% Flexion contracture 7.5% Hypertonia 7.5% Hypokalemia 7.5% Hyponatremia 7.5% Malignant hyperthermia 7.5% Myopathy 7.5% Ophthalmoparesis 7.5% Paresthesia 7.5% Respiratory insufficiency 7.5% Skeletal muscle atrophy 7.5% Skeletal muscle hypertrophy 7.5% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Episodic flaccid weakness - Infantile onset - Periodic hyperkalemic paralysis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
