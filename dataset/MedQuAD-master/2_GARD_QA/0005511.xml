			<Question qid="0005511-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Scleroderma ?</Question>
			<Answer>Scleroderma is an autoimmune disorder that involves changes in the skin, blood vessels, muscles, and internal organs. There are two main types: localized scleroderma, which affects only the skin; and systemic scleroderma, which affects the blood vessels and internal organs, as well as the skin. These two main types also have different sub-types. Localized scleroderma can be divided in: Linear scleroderma (en coup de sabre) Morphea (localized, generalized, guttata and deep). Systemic scleroderma is subdivided in: Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (which includes CREST syndrome) Limited Systemic Sclerosis (or systemic sclerosis sine scleroderm). There are also cases of environmentally-induced scleroderma and cases where scleroderma is part of other rheumatic disorders, like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or Sjogren syndrome. The underlying cause of scleroderma is currently unknown; however, some scientists suspect that it may be related to a buildup of collagen in the skin and other organs due to an abnormal immune system response. There is no cure, but various treatments can relieve symptoms.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0005511-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Scleroderma ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Scleroderma? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Scleroderma. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the stomach 90% Acrocyanosis 90% Arthralgia 90% Arthritis 90% Autoimmunity 90% Cheilitis 90% Chest pain 90% Dry skin 90% Gangrene 90% Gingivitis 90% Lack of skin elasticity 90% Muscle weakness 90% Myalgia 90% Nausea and vomiting 90% Restrictive lung disease 90% Skin ulcer 90% Xerostomia 90% Abdominal pain 50% Abnormal pattern of respiration 50% Abnormal tendon morphology 50% Abnormality of the pericardium 50% Arrhythmia 50% Bowel incontinence 50% Chondrocalcinosis 50% Coronary artery disease 50% Cranial nerve paralysis 50% Decreased nerve conduction velocity 50% Feeding difficulties in infancy 50% Hyperkeratosis 50% Hypopigmented skin patches 50% Malabsorption 50% Mucosal telangiectasiae 50% Myositis 50% Nephropathy 50% Pulmonary fibrosis 50% Recurrent urinary tract infections 50% Telangiectasia of the skin 50% Urticaria 50% Weight loss 50% Behavioral abnormality 7.5% Cirrhosis 7.5% Congestive heart failure 7.5% Erectile abnormalities 7.5% Gastrointestinal hemorrhage 7.5% Gingival bleeding 7.5% Hematuria 7.5% Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 7.5% Memory impairment 7.5% Narrow mouth 7.5% Neoplasm of the lung 7.5% Osteolysis 7.5% Osteomyelitis 7.5% Peripheral neuropathy 7.5% Pulmonary hypertension 7.5% Pulmonary infiltrates 7.5% Renal insufficiency 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Skeletal muscle atrophy 7.5% Tracheoesophageal fistula 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
