			<Question qid="0002391-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Floating-Harbor syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Floating-Harbor syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Floating-Harbor syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the eyelashes 90% Abnormality of the voice 90% Abnormality of thumb phalanx 90% Broad columella 90% Delayed skeletal maturation 90% Limitation of joint mobility 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Neurological speech impairment 90% Short neck 90% Short philtrum 90% Short stature 90% Thin vermilion border 90% Wide mouth 90% Wide nasal bridge 90% Abnormality of immune system physiology 50% Abnormality of the clavicle 50% Abnormality of the soft palate 50% Brachydactyly syndrome 50% Camptodactyly of finger 50% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 50% Cognitive impairment 50% Constipation 50% Deeply set eye 50% Hypertrichosis 50% Intrauterine growth retardation 50% Joint dislocation 50% Joint hypermobility 50% Malabsorption 50% Triangular face 50% Underdeveloped nasal alae 50% Abnormality of the fingernails 7.5% Abnormality of the urethra 7.5% Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 7.5% Hypoplasia of penis 7.5% Strabismus 7.5% Telecanthus 7.5% Trigonocephaly 7.5% Atria septal defect 5% Coarctation of aorta 5% Conductive hearing impairment 5% Congenital posterior urethral valve 5% Cryptorchidism 5% Hydronephrosis 5% Hypermetropia 5% Hypospadias 5% Inguinal hernia 5% Mesocardia 5% Nephrocalcinosis 5% Persistent left superior vena cava 5% Recurrent otitis media 5% Umbilical hernia 5% Varicocele 5% Autosomal dominant inheritance - Celiac disease - Cone-shaped epiphyses of the phalanges of the hand - Downturned corners of mouth - Expressive language delay - Hirsutism - Joint laxity - Long eyelashes - Low posterior hairline - Posteriorly rotated ears - Prominent nose - Smooth philtrum - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002391-4" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Floating-Harbor syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>How might Floating-Harbor syndrome be treated? Treatment for Floating-Harbor syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. For example, dental problems and cataracts may be surgically corrected and sign language and/or speech therapy may help with delays in expressive language.
