			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Lipodystrophy, familial partial, type 2? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lipodystrophy, familial partial, type 2. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of lipid metabolism 90% Diabetes mellitus 90% Hepatomegaly 90% Insulin resistance 90% Lipoatrophy 90% Multiple lipomas 90% Round face 90% Skeletal muscle hypertrophy 90% Acute pancreatitis 75% Abnormality of the nail 50% Advanced eruption of teeth 50% Secondary amenorrhea 50% Thin skin 50% Abnormality of complement system 7.5% Acanthosis nigricans 7.5% Cellulitis 7.5% Congestive heart failure 7.5% Coronary artery disease 7.5% Cranial nerve paralysis 7.5% Glomerulopathy 7.5% Hepatic steatosis 7.5% Hypertrichosis 7.5% Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 7.5% Myalgia 7.5% Myopathy 7.5% Polycystic ovaries 7.5% Splenomegaly 7.5% Toxemia of pregnancy 7.5% Adipose tissue loss - Atherosclerosis - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Decreased subcutaneous fat - Enlarged peripheral nerve - Hirsutism - Hyperglycemia - Hyperinsulinemia - Hypertension - Hypertriglyceridemia - Hypoalphalipoproteinemia - Increased adipose tissue around the neck - Increased facial adipose tissue - Increased intraabdominal fat - Increased intramuscular fat - Insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus - Labial pseudohypertrophy - Loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue in limbs - Loss of truncal subcutaneous adipose tissue - Prominent superficial veins - Xanthomatosis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
