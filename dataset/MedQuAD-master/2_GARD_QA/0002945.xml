			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Hurler syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hurler syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the tonsils 90% Anteverted nares 90% Cerebral palsy 90% Coarse facial features 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Depressed nasal bridge 90% Frontal bossing 90% Full cheeks 90% Hepatomegaly 90% Hernia 90% Hypertrichosis 90% Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 90% Large face 90% Mucopolysacchariduria 90% Muscular hypotonia 90% Short neck 90% Sinusitis 90% Skeletal dysplasia 90% Splenomegaly 90% Thick eyebrow 90% Wide nasal bridge 90% Abnormality of epiphysis morphology 50% Abnormality of finger 50% Abnormality of the elbow 50% Abnormality of the ribs 50% Abnormality of the tongue 50% Dolichocephaly 50% Glaucoma 50% Hearing impairment 50% Hydrocephalus 50% Hypertension 50% Malabsorption 50% Opacification of the corneal stroma 50% Recurrent respiratory infections 50% Retinopathy 50% Scoliosis 50% Short stature 50% Sleep disturbance 50% Thick lower lip vermilion 50% C1-C2 subluxation 38% Abnormal pyramidal signs 7.5% Abnormality of skin pigmentation 7.5% Coronary artery disease 7.5% Decreased nerve conduction velocity 7.5% Hemiplegia/hemiparesis 7.5% Spinal canal stenosis 7.5% Retinal degeneration 5% Mitral regurgitation 10/12 Aortic regurgitation 4/12 Recurrent respiratory infections 4/12 Endocardial fibroelastosis 11/58 Abnormal CNS myelination - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Biconcave vertebral bodies - Broad nasal tip - Calvarial hyperostosis - Cardiomyopathy - Coxa valga - Diaphyseal thickening - Dysostosis multiplex - Flared iliac wings - Flexion contracture - Gingival overgrowth - Hepatosplenomegaly - Hirsutism - Hypoplasia of the femoral head - Hypoplasia of the odontoid process - Inguinal hernia - Intellectual disability - Joint stiffness - J-shaped sella turcica - Kyphosis - Macrocephaly - Microdontia - Neurodegeneration - Progressive neurologic deterioration - Short clavicles - Thick vermilion border - Umbilical hernia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
