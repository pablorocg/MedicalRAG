			<Question qid="0003495-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Lattice corneal dystrophy type 3A ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lattice corneal dystrophy type 3A is rare condition that affects the cornea. It is characterized primarily by protein clumps in the clear, outer covering of the eye which cloud the cornea and impair vision. Affected people also experience recurrent corneal erosion (separation of certain layers of the cornea), which is associated with severe pain and sensitivity to bright light. Lattice corneal dystrophy type 3A is caused by changes (mutations) in the TGFBI gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The condition is usually treated surgically.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003495-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Lattice corneal dystrophy type 3A ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Lattice corneal dystrophy type 3A? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lattice corneal dystrophy type 3A. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Corneal erosion - Lattice corneal dystrophy - Reduced visual acuity - Visual impairment - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
