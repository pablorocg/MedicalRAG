			<Question qid="0005761-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Spinocerebellar ataxia 11 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11) is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia (difficulty walking and balance) and abnormal eye signs (jerky pursuit, horizontal and vertical movements (nystagmus), pyramidal features (increased muscular tonus, increased reflexes and an abnormal reflex known as Babinski sign and inability to make to perform fine movements), peripheral neuropathy with numbness, weakness or pain in the feet or hands or other places of the body and dystonia. It is a very rare disease and very few patients have been reported to date. In them, age of onset ranged from the early teens to the second decade of life and life span was normal. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms and with a genetic exam showing an alteration (mutation) in the TTBK2 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment may include speech and language therapy for talking and swallowing problems, occupational therapy, including home adaptations, physiotherapy and use of assistive walking devices and ankle-foot orthotics (AFOs) for those with neuropathy.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0005761-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Spinocerebellar ataxia 11 ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Spinocerebellar ataxia 11? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Spinocerebellar ataxia 11. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Adult onset - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cerebellar atrophy - Dysarthria - Hyperreflexia - Nystagmus - Progressive cerebellar ataxia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0005761-3" qtype="inheritance">Is Spinocerebellar ataxia 11 inherited ?</Question>
			<Answer>How is spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 inherited? SCA11 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The rate of de novo mutations is not known. Each child of an individual with SCA11 has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Prenatal diagnosis for at-risk pregnancies is possible if the diagnosis has been confirmed by molecular genetic testing in a parent. Each child of an individual with SCA11 has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. Genetic testing of adults who do not have any symptoms but are at-risk of having inherited the mutation is possible. However, testing is not useful in predicting age of onset, severity, type of symptoms, or rate of progression in individuals who do not have any symptom. The affected family member should be tested first to confirm the molecular diagnosis in the family. The best person who can answer questions and address any concerns about inheritance questions is a genetic professional. To find a genetics clinic, we recommend that you contact your primary healthcare provider for a referral. The following online resources can also help you find a genetics professional in your community:  GeneTests offers a searchable directory of U.S. and international genetics and prenatal diagnosis clinics. https://www.genetests.org/clinics  The National Society of Genetic Counselors provides a searchable directory of US and international genetic counseling services. http://nsgc.org/p/cm/ld/fid=164  The American College of Medical Genetics has a searchable database of US genetics clinics. https://www.acmg.net/ACMG/Find_Genetic_Services/ACMG/ISGweb/FindaGeneticService.aspx?hkey=720856ab-a827-42fb-a788-b618b15079f9  The University of Kansas Medical Center provides a list of US and international genetic centers, clinics, and departments. http://www.kumc.edu/GEC/prof/genecntr.html  The American Society of Human Genetics maintains a database of its members, which includes individuals who live outside of the United States. Visit the link to obtain a list of the geneticists in your country, some of whom may be researchers that do not provide medical care. http://www.ashg.org/pages/member_search.shtml The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) is a centralized online resource for information about genetic tests. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. Please see a list of laboratories offering the genetic test for spinocerebellar ataxia type 11. For detailed information on testing, inheritance and genetic counseling and a comprehensive review of spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 you can visit GeneReviews. GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1757/</Answer>
