			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Chitayat Meunier Hodgkinson syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Chitayat Meunier Hodgkinson syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Abnormality of the nose 90% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 90% Delayed skeletal maturation 90% Epicanthus 90% Frontal bossing 90% Glossoptosis 90% High forehead 90% Hypoplasia of the zygomatic bone 90% Long philtrum 90% Oral cleft 90% Proptosis 90% Proximal placement of thumb 90% Sandal gap 90% Short distal phalanx of finger 90% Triphalangeal thumb 90% Underdeveloped supraorbital ridges 90% Abnormal hair quantity 50% Abnormality of dental color 50% Carious teeth 50% Microdontia 50% Cleft palate - Easily subluxated first metacarpophalangeal joints - Hyperconvex nail - Pierre-Robin sequence - Tapered finger - X-linked inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
