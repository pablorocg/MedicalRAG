			<Answer>Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) is a rare condition in which cells called neuroendocrine cells spread and cluster in the small airways of the lungs. The majority of affected individuals are middled-aged women. Symptoms include shortness of breath and coughing. It is considered to be a precursor for pulmonary carcinoid tumors. Because so few cases have been reported in the medical literature, there is limited information on the prognosis and management of this condition.</Answer>
