			<Question qid="0006571-1" qtype="information">What is (are) 22q11.2 duplication syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>22q11.2 duplication syndrome is a condition caused by an extra copy of a small piece of chromosome 22 which contains about 30 to 40 genes. The features of this condition vary widely, even among members of the same family (intrafamilial variability). Affected individuals may have intellectual or learning disability, developmental delay, slow growth leading to short stature, and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Many people with the condition have no apparent physical or intellectual disabilities. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with about 70% genes of affected individuals inheriting the condition from a parent. In other cases it occurs as a de novo mutation (new genetic change) in an individual; however, individuals with a de novo mutation can can pass the duplication to their children. Researchers are working to determine which duplicated genes may contribute to the developmental delay and other problems that sometimes affect people with this condition. Duplication is not detectable by karyotype and most of the people with 22q11.2 duplication syndrome are identified by a special technique known as chromosomal microarray. Treatment depends on the symptoms and includes an individualized educational program. Read more out chromosome 22.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0006571-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of 22q11.2 duplication syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of 22q11.2 duplication syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for 22q11.2 duplication syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of chromosome segregation 90% Abnormal nasal morphology 50% Abnormality of the pharynx 50% Abnormality of the voice 50% Cleft palate 50% Cognitive impairment 50% Epicanthus 50% High forehead 50% Hypertelorism 50% Malar flattening 50% Muscular hypotonia 50% Narrow face 50% Neurological speech impairment 50% Abnormality of immune system physiology 7.5% Abnormality of the aorta 7.5% Abnormality of the philtrum 7.5% Abnormality of the upper urinary tract 7.5% Anterior creases of earlobe 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the thymus 7.5% Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 7.5% Autism 7.5% Displacement of the external urethral meatus 7.5% Hearing impairment 7.5% Hypoplastic left heart 7.5% Microcephaly 7.5% Obsessive-compulsive behavior 7.5% Ptosis 7.5% Scoliosis 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Stereotypic behavior 7.5% Tetralogy of Fallot 7.5% Transposition of the great arteries 7.5% Ventricular septal defect 7.5% Abnormality of cardiovascular system morphology - Abnormality of the pinna - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Delayed speech and language development - Depressed nasal ridge - Growth delay - High palate - Intellectual disability - Low-set ears - Nasal speech - Specific learning disability - Sporadic - Velopharyngeal insufficiency - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
