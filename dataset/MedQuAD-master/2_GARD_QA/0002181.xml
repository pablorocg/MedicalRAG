			<Question qid="0002181-1" qtype="causes">What causes Ewing's family of tumors ?</Question>
			<Answer>What causes Askins tumor? In 80% to 90% of Askins tumors, a part of chromosome 11 and chromosome 22 are translocated. &apos;Translocation&apos; means that the chromosomes have exchanged material. This exchange of material interrupts the cell&apos;s ability to grow and divide normally. In general, cancers are caused when the genes that regulate the cell&apos;s growth and division are changed. The cause of the changes is unknown, but may be due to a combination of genetic factors, environmental factors, and the process of aging. The development of cancer is not a quick or simple process. It is a progression involving a build-up of changes in a number of different genes in the cells of the body tissues over time.</Answer>
