			<Question qid="0002539-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Giant axonal neuropathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormally large and dysfunctional axons (the specialized extensions of nerve cells that are required for the transmission of nerve impulses). The condition typically appears in infancy or early childhood with severe peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy (affecting movement and sensation in the arms and legs). Early signs include difficulty walking, lack of coordination, and loss of strength. Over time, the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) becomes involved, causing a gradual decline in mental function, loss of control of body movements, and seizures. Giant axonal neuropathy is caused by mutations in the GAN gene. It follows and autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Management is directed by a multidisciplinary team with the goal of optimizing intellectual and physical development.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002539-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Giant axonal neuropathy ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Giant axonal neuropathy? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Giant axonal neuropathy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Intellectual disability 5% Abnormal pyramidal signs - Abnormality of the cerebellum - Abnormality of the hand - Areflexia of lower limbs - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Curly hair - Decreased number of peripheral myelinated nerve fibers - Distal amyotrophy - Distal muscle weakness - Distal sensory impairment - Dysarthria - Facial palsy - Hyperreflexia - Hyporeflexia of lower limbs - Juvenile onset - Morphological abnormality of the pyramidal tract - Motor axonal neuropathy - Nystagmus - Pes cavus - Pes planus - Phenotypic variability - Proximal muscle weakness - Scoliosis - Sensory axonal neuropathy - Slow progression - Spastic paraplegia - Steppage gait - Talipes equinovarus - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
