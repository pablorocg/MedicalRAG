			<Question qid="0000160-1" qtype="information">What is (are) ADNP syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>ADNP syndrome, also known as Helsmoortel-van der Aa syndrome, is a complex neuro-developmental disorder that affects the brain and many other areas and functions of the body. ADNP syndrome can affect muscle tone, feeding, growth, hearing, vision, sleep, fine and gross motor skills, as well as the immune system, heart, endocrine system, and gastrointestinal tract.[1] ADNP syndrome causes behavior disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ADNP is caused by a non-inherited (de novo) ADNP gene mutation. ADNP syndrome is thought to be one of the most common causes of non-inherited genetic autism.[1]</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000160-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of ADNP syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of ADNP syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for ADNP syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of cardiovascular system morphology 5% Seizures 5% Autistic behavior - Cleft eyelid - Feeding difficulties - Hyperactivity - Hypermetropia - Intellectual disability - Joint laxity - Language impairment - Muscular hypotonia - Obesity - Obsessive-compulsive behavior - Prominent forehead - Ptosis - Recurrent infections - Short nose - Short stature - Small hand - Smooth philtrum - Stereotypic behavior - Strabismus - Visual impairment - Wide nasal bridge - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
