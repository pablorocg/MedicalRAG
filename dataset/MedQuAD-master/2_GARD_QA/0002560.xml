			<Question qid="0002560-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Glanzmann thrombasthenia ?</Question>
			<Answer>Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare inherited blood clotting disorder that is present at birth. It is characterized by the impaired function of specialized blood cells, called platelets, that are essential for proper blood clotting. Signs and symptoms vary greatly from person to person. Symptoms usually include abnormal bleeding, which can be severe. Other symptoms may include easy bruising, nose bleeds, bleeding from the gums, and/or heavy menstrual bleeding. Rarely, internal bleeding and blood in the urine (hematuria) can occur. Prolonged untreated or unsuccessfully treated bleeding may be life threatening. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is caused by mutations in either the ITGA2B or ITGB3 genes.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002560-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Glanzmann thrombasthenia ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Glanzmann thrombasthenia? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Glanzmann thrombasthenia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bruising susceptibility - Decreased platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa - Epistaxis - Gastrointestinal hemorrhage - Gingival bleeding - Impaired platelet aggregation - Intracranial hemorrhage - Menorrhagia - Prolonged bleeding time - Purpura - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
