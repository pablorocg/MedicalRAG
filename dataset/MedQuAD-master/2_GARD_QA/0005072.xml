			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Progeroid syndrome Petty type? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Progeroid syndrome Petty type. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal dermatoglyphics 90% Abnormality of hair texture 90% Abnormality of the eyelashes 90% Abnormality of the fontanelles or cranial sutures 90% Anonychia 90% Broad forehead 90% Cutis laxa 90% Decreased skull ossification 90% Epicanthus 90% Hypertrichosis 90% Intrauterine growth retardation 90% Lipoatrophy 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Mandibular prognathia 90% Prematurely aged appearance 90% Reduced number of teeth 90% Sacrococcygeal pilonidal abnormality 90% Shagreen patch 90% Short distal phalanx of finger 90% Short stature 90% Strabismus 90% Thick eyebrow 90% Umbilical hernia 90% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
