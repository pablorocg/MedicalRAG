			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Orofaciodigital syndrome 8? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Orofaciodigital syndrome 8. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of calvarial morphology 90% Abnormality of the eyelashes 90% Abnormality of the palate 90% Abnormality of the voice 90% Anteverted nares 90% Bifid tongue 90% Blepharophimosis 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Camptodactyly of finger 90% Chorioretinal coloboma 90% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 90% Cognitive impairment 90% EEG abnormality 90% Finger syndactyly 90% Hearing abnormality 90% Increased number of teeth 90% Lip pit 90% Microcephaly 90% Non-midline cleft lip 90% Nystagmus 90% Polyhydramnios 90% Postaxial hand polydactyly 90% Prominent nasal bridge 90% Short philtrum 90% Short stature 90% Synophrys 90% Tapered finger 90% Telecanthus 90% Upslanted palpebral fissure 90% Ventriculomegaly 90% Wide nasal bridge 90% Bifid nasal tip - Broad nasal tip - Cleft palate - High palate - Hypertelorism - Hypoplasia of the epiglottis - Median cleft lip - Milia - Polydactyly - Recurrent aspiration pneumonia - Short tibia - Strabismus - Syndactyly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
