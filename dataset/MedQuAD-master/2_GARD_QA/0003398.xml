			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Kleefstra syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Kleefstra syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Anteverted nares 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Hypertelorism 90% Intellectual disability 90% Malar flattening 90% Muscular hypotonia 90% Neurological speech impairment 90% Short nose 90% Tented upper lip vermilion 90% Abnormality of the aorta 50% Abnormality of the aortic valve 50% Arrhythmia 50% Autism 50% Brachycephaly 50% Broad forehead 50% Coarse facial features 50% Constipation 50% Delayed speech and language development 50% Hearing impairment 50% Highly arched eyebrow 50% Macroglossia 50% Mandibular prognathia 50% Microcephaly 50% Obesity 50% Otitis media 50% Protruding tongue 50% Sleep disturbance 50% Synophrys 50% Thickened helices 50% Upslanted palpebral fissure 50% U-Shaped upper lip vermilion 50% Ventricular septal defect 50% Aggressive behavior 33% Cryptorchidism 33% Hypospadias 33% Micropenis 33% Recurrent respiratory infections 33% Stereotypic behavior 33% Seizures 30% Abnormality of the pulmonary artery 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum 7.5% Bowel incontinence 7.5% Cerebral cortical atrophy 7.5% Delayed eruption of teeth 7.5% Developmental regression 7.5% Downturned corners of mouth 7.5% Facial asymmetry 7.5% Hernia 7.5% Limitation of joint mobility 7.5% Natal tooth 7.5% Persistence of primary teeth 7.5% Pyloric stenosis 7.5% Renal cyst 7.5% Renal insufficiency 7.5% Respiratory insufficiency 7.5% Scoliosis 7.5% Self-injurious behavior 7.5% Short stature 7.5% Supernumerary nipple 7.5% Talipes equinovarus 7.5% Tetralogy of Fallot 7.5% Ventriculomegaly 7.5% Vesicoureteral reflux 7.5% Gastroesophageal reflux 5% Apathy 1% Tracheobronchomalacia 1% Microcephaly 8/22 Hearing impairment 3/22 Autosomal dominant inheritance - Brachydactyly syndrome - Flat face - Hypoplasia of midface - Intellectual disability, severe - Obsessive-compulsive behavior - Single transverse palmar crease - Sporadic - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
