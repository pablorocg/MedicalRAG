			<Question qid="0000193-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome type 1 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome is an inherited condition that mainly affects the brain, immune system, and skin. It is characterized by early-onset severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) that usually results in severe intellectual and physical disability. Additional symptoms may include epilepsy, painful, itchy skin lesion (chilblains), vision problems, and joint stiffness. Symptoms usually progress over several months before the disease course stabilizes. There are six different types of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, which are distinguished by the gene that causes the condition: TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, and ADAR genes. Most cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, although rare autosomal dominant cases have been reported. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000193-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome type 1 ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome type 1? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome type 1. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Hepatomegaly 5% Splenomegaly 5% Abnormality of extrapyramidal motor function - Acrocyanosis - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cerebral atrophy - Chilblain lesions - Chronic CSF lymphocytosis - Deep white matter hypodensities - Dystonia - Elevated hepatic transaminases - Feeding difficulties in infancy - Fever - Hepatosplenomegaly - Increased CSF interferon alpha - Intellectual disability, profound - Leukoencephalopathy - Morphological abnormality of the pyramidal tract - Multiple gastric polyps - Muscular hypotonia of the trunk - Nystagmus - Petechiae - Poor head control - Progressive encephalopathy - Progressive microcephaly - Prolonged neonatal jaundice - Purpura - Seizures - Spasticity - Strabismus - Thrombocytopenia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
