			<Question qid="0000393-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Antecubital pterygium ?</Question>
			<Answer>Antecubital pterygium is characterized by and antecubital webbing, posterior subluxation (dislocation) of radial head, maldevelopment of radioulnar joint, and limited elbow extension with unimpeded elbow flexion. Most reported cases come from the island of Mauritius or nearby islands. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. This condition is sometimes found as a symptom of nail-patella syndrome.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000393-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Antecubital pterygium ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Antecubital pterygium? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Antecubital pterygium. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Abnormality of the toenails 90% Abnormality of the ulna 90% Amniotic constriction ring 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the radius 90% Limitation of joint mobility 90% Abnormality of pelvic girdle bone morphology 50% Elbow dislocation 50% Camptodactyly of finger 7.5% Displacement of the external urethral meatus 7.5% Glaucoma 7.5% Hand polydactyly 7.5% Nephropathy 7.5% Patellar aplasia 7.5% Urogenital fistula 7.5% Antecubital pterygium - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Limited elbow extension - Maldevelopment of radioulnar joint - Posterior subluxation of radial head - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
