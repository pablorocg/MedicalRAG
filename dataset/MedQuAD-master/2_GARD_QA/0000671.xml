			<Question qid="0000671-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Bednar tumor ?</Question>
			<Answer>Bednar tumor is a rare variant of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), a soft tissue sarcoma that develops in the deep layers of the skin. It accounts for approximately 1% of all DFSP cases. Bednar tumor is also known as pigmented DFSP because it contains dark-colored cells that give may give the tumor a multi-colored (i.e red and brown) appearance. The tumor may begin as a painless, slow-growing papule or patch of skin; however, accelerated growth, bleeding and/or pain are often observed as it grows. The underlying cause of Bednar tumor is unknown. There is currently no evidence of an inherited risk for the condition and most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Treatment varies based on the severity of the condition, the location of the tumor and the overall health of the affected person. The tumor is generally treated with surgery. In advanced cases, radiation therapy and/or systemic therapy may be recommended, as well.</Answer>
