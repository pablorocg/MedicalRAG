			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Kniest like dysplasia lethal? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Kniest like dysplasia lethal. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal diaphysis morphology 90% Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 90% Abnormality of the clavicle 90% Hydrops fetalis 90% Limb undergrowth 90% Lymphedema 90% Macrocephaly 90% Malar flattening 90% Muscular hypotonia 90% Narrow chest 90% Osteoarthritis 90% Respiratory insufficiency 90% Short neck 90% Short stature 90% Short thorax 90% Spina bifida occulta 90% Abnormality of the helix 50% Arrhythmia 50% Atria septal defect 50% Brachydactyly syndrome 50% Cleft palate 50% Depressed nasal bridge 50% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 50% Proptosis 50% Abnormality of the pinna - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Breech presentation - Broad ribs - Coronal cleft vertebrae - Dumbbell-shaped long bone - Edema - Flared metaphysis - Flat face - Hypertelorism - Hypoplastic ilia - Hypoplastic vertebral bodies - Lethal short-limbed short stature - Low-set ears - Narrow mouth - Patent ductus arteriosus - Platyspondyly - Polyhydramnios - Premature birth - Protuberant abdomen - Relative macrocephaly - Rhizomelia - Short diaphyses - Short ribs - Skeletal dysplasia - Talipes equinovarus - Wide anterior fontanel - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
