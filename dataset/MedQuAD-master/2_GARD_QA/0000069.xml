			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Acrocapitofemoral dysplasia? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Acrocapitofemoral dysplasia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the femur 90% Abnormality of the hip bone 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Cone-shaped epiphysis 90% Delayed skeletal maturation 90% Micromelia 90% Short stature 90% Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 50% Abnormality of the metacarpal bones 50% Anonychia 50% Genu varum 50% Hyperlordosis 50% Macrocephaly 7.5% Narrow chest 7.5% Pectus carinatum 7.5% Pectus excavatum 7.5% Scoliosis 7.5% Short thorax 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Broad nail - Cone-shaped capital femoral epiphysis - Cone-shaped epiphysis of the 1st metacarpal - Coxa vara - Cupped ribs - Delayed ossification of carpal bones - Disproportionate short stature - Disproportionate short-limb short stature - Dysplasia of the femoral head - Enlargement of the distal femoral epiphysis - Fibular overgrowth - Flared iliac wings - Hypoplasia of the radius - Hypoplasia of the ulna - Hypoplastic iliac wing - Lumbar hyperlordosis - Ovoid vertebral bodies - Relative macrocephaly - Short distal phalanx of finger - Short femoral neck - Short femur - Short humerus - Short metacarpal - Short palm - Short proximal phalanx of finger - Short proximal phalanx of thumb - Short ribs - Short tibia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
