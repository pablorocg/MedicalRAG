			<Question qid="0001725-1" qtype="information">What is (are) De Barsy syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>De Barsy syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized mainly by a prematurely aged-looking face (progeria); cloudy corneas; short stature; and intellectual disability. Affected individuals can have a wide variety of other signs and symptoms, including loose skin folds due to reduced elasticity (cutis laxa); poor muscle tone (hypotonia); movement disorders; and other features that involve the eyes, face, skin and nervous system. The genetic cause of the condition is not known in most cases, but it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment generally focuses on the signs and symptoms present in each individual and may include early eye surgery and physiotherapy to avoid contractures.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001725-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of De Barsy syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of De Barsy syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for De Barsy syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the fontanelles or cranial sutures 90% Cataract 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Cutis laxa 90% Hyperextensible skin 90% Hyperreflexia 90% Joint hypermobility 90% Muscular hypotonia 90% Opacification of the corneal stroma 90% Prematurely aged appearance 90% Short stature 90% Wide nasal bridge 90% Abnormality of adipose tissue 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the skin 50% Broad forehead 50% Macrotia 50% Abnormality of female external genitalia 7.5% Abnormality of skin pigmentation 7.5% Abnormality of the hip bone 7.5% Adducted thumb 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the abdominal wall musculature 7.5% Blue sclerae 7.5% Chorea 7.5% Flexion contracture 7.5% Genu recurvatum 7.5% Joint dislocation 7.5% Pectus excavatum 7.5% Reduced bone mineral density 7.5% Scoliosis 7.5% Umbilical hernia 7.5% Cryptorchidism 5% Athetosis - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Brachycephaly - Congenital hip dislocation - Corneal arcus - Delayed skeletal maturation - Failure to thrive - Frontal bossing - Hypertelorism - Hypotelorism - Inguinal hernia - Intellectual disability - Intrauterine growth retardation - Large fontanelles - Low-set ears - Myopia - Narrow mouth - Narrow nasal ridge - Prominent forehead - Prominent superficial blood vessels - Seizures - Severe short stature - Sparse hair - Sporadic - Strabismus - Talipes equinovarus - Thin skin - Wide cranial sutures - Wormian bones - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
