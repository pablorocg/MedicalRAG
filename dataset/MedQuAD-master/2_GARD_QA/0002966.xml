			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Hydrocephalus, costovertebral dysplasia, and Sprengel anomaly? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hydrocephalus, costovertebral dysplasia, and Sprengel anomaly. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Hydrocephalus 90% Mandibular prognathia 90% Sprengel anomaly 90% Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 50% Abnormality of dental enamel 50% Abnormality of the palate 50% Abnormality of the ribs 50% Anteverted nares 50% Behavioral abnormality 50% Brachydactyly syndrome 50% Cognitive impairment 50% Depressed nasal bridge 50% High forehead 50% Hypertelorism 50% Hypoplasia of the zygomatic bone 50% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 50% Macrocephaly 50% Melanocytic nevus 50% Obesity 50% Sandal gap 50% Scoliosis 50% Vertebral segmentation defect 50% Abnormality of the nipple 7.5% Myopia 7.5% Strabismus 7.5% Arachnoid cyst 5% Bulbous nose 5% Delayed gross motor development 5% Epicanthus 5% Hypoplasia of dental enamel 5% Intellectual disability 5% Low-set ears 5% Malar flattening 5% Wide nasal bridge 5% High palate - Kyphoscoliosis - Psychosis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
