			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Camptodactyly syndrome Guadalajara type 1? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Camptodactyly syndrome Guadalajara type 1. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the earlobes 90% Camptodactyly of finger 90% Dental malocclusion 90% Malar flattening 90% Pectus carinatum 90% Pectus excavatum 90% Telecanthus 90% Abnormality of calvarial morphology 50% Abnormality of the palate 50% Anteverted nares 50% Brachydactyly syndrome 50% Cognitive impairment 50% Cubitus valgus 50% Delayed skeletal maturation 50% Depressed nasal bridge 50% Downturned corners of mouth 50% Epicanthus 50% Hallux valgus 50% Intrauterine growth retardation 50% Mandibular prognathia 50% Melanocytic nevus 50% Microcephaly 50% Microcornea 50% Narrow chest 50% Narrow face 50% Narrow mouth 50% Seizures 50% Short nose 50% Short stature 50% Short toe 50% Spina bifida 50% Sprengel anomaly 50% Toe syndactyly 50% Underdeveloped supraorbital ridges 50% Blepharophimosis 7.5% Highly arched eyebrow 7.5% Long face 7.5% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 7.5% Sacral dimple 7.5% Short distal phalanx of finger 7.5% Synophrys 7.5% Abnormality of dental eruption - Absent ethmoidal sinuses - Absent frontal sinuses - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bifid uvula - Brachycephaly - Camptodactyly of 2nd-5th fingers - Fibular hypoplasia - Flat face - High palate - Horizontal sacrum - Hypertelorism - Hypoplasia of midface - Hypoplastic 5th lumbar vertebrae - Hypoplastic iliac wing - Intellectual disability - Long neck - Low-set ears - Lumbar hyperlordosis - Microtia - Overfolding of the superior helices - Posteriorly rotated ears - Scapular winging - Short femoral neck - Short foot - Short metatarsal - Short palm - Short palpebral fissure - Small earlobe - Spina bifida occulta - Tubular metacarpal bones - Twelfth rib hypoplasia - Upslanted palpebral fissure - Wormian bones - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
