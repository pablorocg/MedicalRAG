			<Question qid="0000700-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Best vitelliform macular dystrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is a slowly progressive form of macular degeneration. It usually begins in childhood or adolescence, but age of onset and severity of vision loss can vary. Affected people first have normal vision, followed by decreased central visual acuity and distorted vision (metamorphopsia). Peripheral vision is not affected. BVMD is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported. The condition is typically caused by mutations in the BEST1 gene; in a few cases the cause is unknown. Treatment is symptomatic and involves the use of low vision aids.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000700-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Best vitelliform macular dystrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Best vitelliform macular dystrophy? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Best vitelliform macular dystrophy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the macula 90% Visual impairment 90% Abnormality of color vision 50% Choroideremia 7.5% Visual field defect 7.5% Abnormal electroretinogram - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Cystoid macular degeneration - Macular dystrophy - Reduced visual acuity - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000700-3" qtype="causes">What causes Best vitelliform macular dystrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>What causes Best vitelliform macular dystrophy? Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is caused by changes (mutations) in the BEST1 gene. This gene gives the body instructions for making a protein called bestrophin. Bestrophin acts as a channel that controls the movement of chloride ions within the retina. It is thought that mutations in the BEST1 gene affect the shape of the channel and its ability to properly regulate the flow of chloride. However, it is unclear how exactly this relates to the specific features of BVMD.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000700-4" qtype="inheritance">Is Best vitelliform macular dystrophy inherited ?</Question>
			<Answer>How is Best vitelliform macular dystrophy inherited? Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although a few cases with autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported. In autosomal dominant inheritance, having one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause symptoms of the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated gene. Most people with BVMD have an affected parent, but some people have the condition as the result of a new mutation that occurred for the first time. Autosomal recessive inheritance means that a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell to be affected. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000700-5" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Best vitelliform macular dystrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>How is Best vitelliform macular dystrophy diagnosed? Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) may be diagnosed based on the findings on an exam of the fundus (the interior surface of the eye opposite the lens); an electrooculogram (EOG); and the family history. An eye exam may include other tests as well. A fundus exam may show a typical yellow yolk-like macular lesion. An EOG is usually abnormal in affected people, but occasionally, people with signs of BVMD and a mutation in the BEST1 gene have a normal EOG. The family history in affected people is often consistent with either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance. Genetic testing may also be used to make a diagnosis of BVMD. A BEST1 mutation is detected in about 96% of affected people who have an affected family member. In people with no family history of BVMD, the mutation detection rate ranges between 50-70%. The exact type of genetic test ordered to confirm a diagnosis may depend on a person&apos;s ancestry, family history, and/or whether other eye disorders are also being considered.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000700-6" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Best vitelliform macular dystrophy ?</Question>
			<Answer>How might Best vitelliform macular dystrophy be treated? There is no specific treatment for Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) at this time. Low vision aids help affected people with significant loss of visual acuity. Laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, and anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents such as bevacizumab have shown limited success in treating some of the secondary features of BVMD such as choroidal neovascularization (when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula and retina).</Answer>
