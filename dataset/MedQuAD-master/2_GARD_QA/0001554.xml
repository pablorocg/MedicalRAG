			<Question qid="0001554-1" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Congenital rubella ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Congenital rubella? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Congenital rubella. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cataract 90% Intrauterine growth retardation 90% Neurological speech impairment 90% Sensorineural hearing impairment 90% Abnormality of retinal pigmentation 50% Abnormality of the fontanelles or cranial sutures 50% Abnormality of the pulmonary artery 50% Anemia 50% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the iris 50% Atria septal defect 50% Cognitive impairment 50% Glaucoma 50% Hepatomegaly 50% Hypertonia 50% Microcephaly 50% Muscular hypotonia 50% Nystagmus 50% Patent ductus arteriosus 50% Short stature 50% Skin rash 50% Splenomegaly 50% Strabismus 50% Thrombocytopenia 50% Ventricular septal defect 50% Visual impairment 50% Abnormality of the metaphyses 7.5% Opacification of the corneal stroma 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Type I diabetes mellitus 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
