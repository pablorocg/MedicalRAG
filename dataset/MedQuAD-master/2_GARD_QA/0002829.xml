			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 4? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 4. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Epistaxis 90% Telangiectasia of the skin 90% Cavernous hemangioma 50% Microcytic anemia 50% Migraine 50% Portal hypertension 50% Spontaneous hematomas 50% Visceral angiomatosis 50% Abnormality of coagulation 7.5% Abnormality of the retinal vasculature 7.5% Biliary tract abnormality 7.5% Cerebral ischemia 7.5% Cirrhosis 7.5% Congestive heart failure 7.5% Conjunctival telangiectasia 7.5% Esophageal varix 7.5% Gastrointestinal hemorrhage 7.5% Hematuria 7.5% Hemoptysis 7.5% Hepatic failure 7.5% Intestinal polyposis 7.5% Nephrolithiasis 7.5% Peripheral arteriovenous fistula 7.5% Pulmonary embolism 7.5% Pulmonary hypertension 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Thrombophlebitis 7.5% Visual impairment 7.5% Arteriovenous fistulas of celiac and mesenteric vessels - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Celiac artery aneurysm - Cerebral arteriovenous malformation - Cerebral hemorrhage - Cyanosis - Dyspnea - High-output congestive heart failure - Ischemic stroke - Lip telangiectasia - Mesenteric artery aneurysm - Nasal mucosa telangiectasia - Palate telangiectasia - Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation - Right-to-left shunt - Spinal arteriovenous malformation - Spontaneous, recurrent epistaxis - Subarachnoid hemorrhage - Tongue telangiectasia - Transient ischemic attack - Venous varicosities of celiac and mesenteric vessels - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
