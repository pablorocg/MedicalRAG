			<Question qid="0001638-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive type ?</Question>
			<Answer>Autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia is a genetic skeletal condition characterized by progressive thickening of bones in the skull (cranium) and abnormalities at the ends of long bones in the limbs (metaphyseal dysplasia). The overgrowth of bone in the head can lead to distinctive facial features and delayed tooth eruption, as well as compression of the cranial nerves. The condition is caused by mutations in the GJA1 gene. As the name suggests, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and may include surgery to relieve cranial pressure and correct facial deformities.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001638-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive type ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive type? Bone overgrowth in the head causes many of the signs and symptoms of craniometaphyseal dysplasia. Affected individuals typically have distinctive facial features such as a wide nasal bridge, a prominent forehead, wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), and a prominent jaw. Excessive new bone formation (hyperostosis) in the jaw can delay teething (dentition) or result in absent teeth. Infants with this condition may have breathing or feeding problems caused by narrow nasal passages. In severe cases, abnormal bone growth can compress the nerves that emerge from the brain and extend to various areas of the head and neck (cranial nerves). Compression of the cranial nerves can lead to paralyzed facial muscles (facial nerve palsy), blindness, or deafness. The x-rays of individuals with craniometaphyseal dysplasia show unusually shaped long bones, particularly the large bones in the legs. The ends of these bones (metaphyses) are wider and appear less dense in people with this condition. The symptoms seen in autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia are typically more severe than those seen in the autosomal dominant form. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive type. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the metaphyses 90% Craniofacial hyperostosis 90% Depressed nasal bridge 90% Hypertelorism 90% Increased bone mineral density 90% Wide nasal bridge 90% Skeletal dysplasia 50% Telecanthus 50% Conductive hearing impairment 7.5% Facial palsy 7.5% Sensorineural hearing impairment 7.5% Visual impairment 7.5% Abnormality of the nasopharynx - Abnormality of the thorax - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Bony paranasal bossing - Broad alveolar ridges - Club-shaped distal femur - Coarse facial features - Delayed eruption of permanent teeth - Facial hyperostosis - Flared metaphysis - Macrocephaly - Mandibular prognathia - Metaphyseal dysplasia - Mixed hearing impairment - Nasal obstruction - Optic atrophy - Patchy sclerosis of finger phalanx - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001638-3" qtype="causes">What causes Craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive type ?</Question>
			<Answer>What causes autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia? Autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia is caused by mutations in the GJA1 gene. The GJA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called connexin43, which is one of 21 connexin proteins in humans. Connexins lay a role in cell-to-cell communication by forming channels, or gap junctions, between cells. Gap junctions allow for the transport of nutrients, charged particles (ions), and other small molecules that carry necessary communication signals between cells. Connexin43 is found in many human tissues, including eyes, skin, bine, ears, heart, and brain. Mutations in the GJA1 gene that cause autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia appear to disrupt bone remodeling. The exact mechanism involved is yet to be determined.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001638-4" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal recessive type ?</Question>
			<Answer>How might craniometaphyseal dysplasia be treated? Treatment consists primarily of surgery to reduce compression of cranial nerves and the brain stem/spinal cord at the level of the foramen magnum. Severely overgrown facial bones can be contoured; however, surgical procedures can be technically difficult and bone regrowth is common. Individuals with craniometaphyseal dysplasia should have regular neurologic evaluations, hearing assessments, and ophthalmologic examinations. The frequency of these evaluations and assessments should be determined by the individual&apos;s history and severity of skeletal changes.</Answer>
