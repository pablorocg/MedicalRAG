			<Question qid="0005261-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Reactive arthritis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Reactive arthritis is a type of infectious arthritis that occurs as a reaction to an infection elsewhere in the body. This process may occur weeks or even months after the infection has resolved. In addition to joint inflammation, reactive arthritis is associated with two other symptoms: redness and inflammation of the eyes (conjunctivitis) and inflammation of the urinary tract (urethritis). These symptoms may occur alone, together, or not at all. The symptoms of reactive arthritis usually last 3 to 12 months, although symptoms can return or develop into a long-term disease in a small percentage of people. The exact cause of reactive arthritis is unknown. It may follow an infection with Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, Shigella sonnei, Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium, or Chlamydia trachomatis. Certain genes may make you more prone to the syndrome. For instance, the condition is observed more commonly in patients with human lymphocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) histocompatibility antigens. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and treat any underlying infection. Antibiotics may be prescribed. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), pain relievers, and corticosteroids may be recommended for those with joint pain.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0005261-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Reactive arthritis ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Reactive arthritis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Reactive arthritis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Abnormality of the oral cavity 90% Abnormality of the urethra 90% Arthralgia 90% Arthritis 90% Cartilage destruction 90% Enthesitis 90% Hyperkeratosis 90% Inflammatory abnormality of the eye 90% Joint swelling 90% Limitation of joint mobility 90% Malabsorption 90% Osteomyelitis 90% Pustule 90% Abdominal pain 50% Abnormality of the pleura 50% Inflammation of the large intestine 50% Abnormal tendon morphology 7.5% Abnormality of temperature regulation 7.5% Abnormality of the aortic valve 7.5% Abnormality of the pericardium 7.5% Photophobia 7.5% Pulmonary fibrosis 7.5% Recurrent urinary tract infections 7.5% Respiratory insufficiency 7.5% Weight loss 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
