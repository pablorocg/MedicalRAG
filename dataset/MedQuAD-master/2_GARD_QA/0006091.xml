			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Thymic-Renal-Anal-Lung dysplasia? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Thymic-Renal-Anal-Lung dysplasia. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal lung lobation 90% Abnormality of female internal genitalia 90% Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Abnormality of the nose 90% Abnormality of the parathyroid gland 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the lungs 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the thymus 90% Hypoplasia of the ear cartilage 90% Hypoplastic toenails 90% Intestinal malrotation 90% Intrauterine growth retardation 90% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 90% Malar flattening 90% Multicystic kidney dysplasia 90% Oligohydramnios 90% Urogenital fistula 90% Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - Abnormality of the endocrine system - Abnormality of the respiratory system - Anal atresia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Renal agenesis - Ureteral agenesis - Ureteral dysgenesis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
