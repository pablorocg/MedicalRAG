			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Ruvalcaba syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Ruvalcaba syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the metacarpal bones 90% Abnormality of the teeth 90% Brachydactyly syndrome 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Cone-shaped epiphysis 90% Convex nasal ridge 90% Kyphosis 90% Microcephaly 90% Micromelia 90% Narrow mouth 90% Proximal placement of thumb 90% Ptosis 90% Short nose 90% Short palm 90% Synostosis of carpal bones 90% Thin vermilion border 90% Abnormality of the elbow 50% Abnormality of vertebral epiphysis morphology 50% Cryptorchidism 50% High forehead 50% Intrauterine growth retardation 50% Narrow chest 50% Pectus carinatum 50% Scoliosis 50% Abnormal electroretinogram 7.5% Abnormal localization of kidney 7.5% Abnormality of visual evoked potentials 7.5% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 7.5% Hematuria 7.5% Hernia of the abdominal wall 7.5% Hypertrichosis 7.5% Hypopigmented skin patches 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Abnormality of the breast - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Delayed puberty - Dental crowding - Inguinal hernia - Intellectual disability - Limited elbow extension - Narrow nose - Retinal dystrophy - Short foot - Short metacarpal - Short metatarsal - Short phalanx of finger - Short stature - Small hand - Underdeveloped nasal alae - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
