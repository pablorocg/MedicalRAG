			<Question qid="0003384-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Keutel syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keutel syndrome is an inherited condition characterized by cartilage calcification in the ears, nose, larnyx, trachea (voice box), and ribs; pulmonary artery stenoses; brachytelephalangism (short fingers and nails that resemble drumsticks); and facial dysmorphism. Less than 30 cases have been reported in the literature. The majority of affected individuals have been diagnosed during childhood. Other associated features may include hearing loss, recurrent otitis and/or sinusitis, mild intellectual disability, frequent respiratory infections, nasal speech and rarely, seizures, and short stature. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is caused by mutations in the MGP gene.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0003384-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Keutel syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Keutel syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Keutel syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Calcification of cartilage 90% Depressed nasal bridge 90% Long face 90% Malar flattening 90% Short distal phalanx of finger 90% Tracheal stenosis 90% Abnormality of the voice 50% Chondrocalcinosis 50% Cognitive impairment 50% Hearing impairment 50% Otitis media 50% Pulmonary hypertension 50% Recurrent respiratory infections 50% Sinusitis 50% Sloping forehead 50% Underdeveloped nasal alae 50% Ventricular septal defect 50% Alopecia 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the skin 7.5% Cutis laxa 7.5% Optic atrophy 7.5% Seizures 7.5% Short stature 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Calcification of the auricular cartilage - Cartilaginous ossification of larynx - Cartilaginous ossification of nose - Cerebral calcification - Chronic sinusitis - Costal cartilage calcification - Deep philtrum - Epiphyseal stippling - Growth abnormality - Hypoplasia of midface - Intellectual disability, mild - Macrotia - Nasal speech - Peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis - Premature fusion of phalangeal epiphyses - Pulmonary artery hypoplasia - Pulmonic stenosis - Recurrent bronchitis - Recurrent otitis media - Short hallux - Short thumb - Spontaneous abortion - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
