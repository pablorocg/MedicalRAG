			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Woodhouse Sakati syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Woodhouse Sakati syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the genital system 90% Arrhythmia 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Hearing impairment 90% Type I diabetes mellitus 90% Anodontia 5% Hallucinations 5% Prominent nasal bridge 5% Protruding ear 5% Psychosis 5% Triangular face 5% Abnormality of extrapyramidal motor function - Alopecia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Choreoathetosis - Decreased serum testosterone level - Decreased testicular size - Diabetes mellitus - Dysarthria - Dystonia - EKG: T-wave abnormalities - Fine hair - Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism - Hyperlipidemia - Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism - Hypoplasia of the fallopian tube - Hypoplasia of the uterus - Intellectual disability - Micropenis - Phenotypic variability - Primary ovarian failure - Sensorineural hearing impairment - Sparse hair - Thyroid-stimulating hormone excess - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
