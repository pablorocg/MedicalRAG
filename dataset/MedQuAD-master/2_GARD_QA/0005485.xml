			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of SCARF syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for SCARF syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the palate 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the abdominal wall musculature 90% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the nipples 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Craniosynostosis 90% Displacement of the external urethral meatus 90% Hyperextensible skin 90% Hypoplasia of penis 90% Joint hypermobility 90% Long philtrum 90% Prominent nasal bridge 90% Short neck 90% Thickened nuchal skin fold 90% Umbilical hernia 90% Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 50% Abnormal hair quantity 50% Abnormality of dental enamel 50% Deep philtrum 50% Enlarged thorax 50% Epicanthus 50% Hepatomegaly 50% Low-set, posteriorly rotated ears 50% Pectus carinatum 50% Ptosis 50% Barrel-shaped chest - Bifid scrotum - Coronal craniosynostosis - Cryptorchidism - Cutis laxa - Diastasis recti - Hypoplasia of dental enamel - Hypoplastic nipples - Inguinal hernia - Intellectual disability - Lambdoidal craniosynostosis - Low anterior hairline - Low posterior hairline - Low-set ears - Micropenis - Perineal hypospadias - Posteriorly rotated ears - Short chin - Short sternum - Sparse hair - Strabismus - Webbed neck - Wide intermamillary distance - Wide nasal bridge - X-linked recessive inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
