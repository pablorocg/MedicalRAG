			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Familial partial lipodystrophy associated with PPARG mutations? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Familial partial lipodystrophy associated with PPARG mutations. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of lipid metabolism 90% Abnormality of the menstrual cycle 90% Diabetes mellitus 90% Hypertension 90% Insulin resistance 90% Acanthosis nigricans 50% Hepatic steatosis 50% Hyperuricemia 50% Cirrhosis 7.5% Coronary artery disease 7.5% Hypertrichosis 7.5% Polycystic ovaries 7.5% Toxemia of pregnancy 7.5% Abnormality of the face - Abnormality of the musculature - Abnormality of the neck - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Decreased subcutaneous fat - Hirsutism - Hyperglycemia - Hyperinsulinemia - Hypertriglyceridemia - Hypoalphalipoproteinemia - Insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus - Lipodystrophy - Loss of gluteal subcutaneous adipose tissue - Loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue in limbs - Maternal diabetes - Oligomenorrhea - Preeclampsia - Primary amenorrhea - Prominent superficial veins - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
