			<Question qid="0002971-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Hydrops fetalis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hydrops fetalis is a serious condition in which abnormal amounts of fluid build up in two or more body areas of a fetus or newborn. There are two types of hydrops fetalis: immune and nonimmune. Immune hydrops fetalis is a complication of a severe form of Rh incompatibility. Rh compatibility causes massive red blood cell destruction, which leads to several problems, including total body swelling. Severe swelling can interfere with how the body organs work. Nonimmune hydrops fetalis occurs when a disease or medical condition disrupts the body&apos;s ability to manage fluid. There are three main causes for this type: heart or lung problems, severe anemia (thalassemia), and genetic defects, including Turner syndrome. The exact cause depends on which form a baby has.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002971-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Hydrops fetalis ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Hydrops fetalis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hydrops fetalis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the heme biosynthetic pathway 90% Anemia 90% Congestive heart failure 90% Hydrops fetalis 90% Pallor 90% Hepatomegaly 50% Hydrocephalus 50% Oligohydramnios 50% Polyhydramnios 50% Splenomegaly 50% Toxemia of pregnancy 50% Abnormality of the pericardium 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
