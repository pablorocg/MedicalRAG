			<Question qid="0002659-1" qtype="information">What is (are) GRACILE syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>GRACILE syndrome is an inherited metabolic disease. GRACILE stands for growth retardation, aminoaciduria, cholestasis, iron overload, lactacidosis, and early death. Infants are very small at birth and quickly develop life-threatening complications. During the first days of life, infants will develop a buildup of lactic acid in the bloodstream (lactic acidosis) and amino acids in the urine (aminoaciduria). They will also have problems with the flow of bile from the liver (cholestasis) and too much iron in their blood. Affected individuals arent typically born with unique physical features. Although alkali therapy is used as treatment, about half of affected infants do not survive past the first days of life. Those that do survive this period generally do not live past 4 months despite receiving treatment. GRACILE syndrome is caused by a mutation in the BCS1L gene, and it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The BCS1L gene provides instructions needed by the mitochondria in cells to help produce energy.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0002659-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of GRACILE syndrome ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of GRACILE syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for GRACILE syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of iron homeostasis 90% Abnormality of the renal tubule 90% Aminoaciduria 90% Cirrhosis 90% Hearing impairment 90% Hepatic steatosis 90% Abnormality of hair texture 50% Aminoaciduria 20/20 Cholestasis 19/20 Neonatal hypotonia 3/20 Chronic lactic acidosis - Increased serum ferritin - Increased serum iron - Increased serum pyruvate - Intrauterine growth retardation - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
