			<Question qid="0001170-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Chondrodysplasia punctata 2 X-linked dominant ?</Question>
			<Answer>X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX2), also known as Conradi-Hnermann-Happle syndrome, is a rare form of skeletal dysplasia characterized by skeletal malformations, skin abnormalities, cataracts and short stature. The specific symptoms and severity of the disorder may vary greatly from one individual to another. CDPX2 is caused by mutations in the emopamil binding protein gene, EBP. In many cases, this mutation occurs randomly, for no apparent reason (i.e., new mutation). The condition  is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait and occurs almost exclusively in females. Treatment of CDPX2 is directed toward the specific symptoms that present in each individual. Such treatment may require the coordinated efforts of a team of medical professionals, including physicians who diagnose and treat disorders of the skeleton, joints, muscles, and related tissues (orthopedists); skin specialists (dermatologists); eye specialists; and/or other health care professionals.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001170-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Chondrodysplasia punctata 2 X-linked dominant ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Chondrodysplasia punctata 2 X-linked dominant? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Chondrodysplasia punctata 2 X-linked dominant. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal hair quantity 90% Abnormal joint morphology 90% Abnormality of the fingernails 90% Asymmetric growth 90% Epicanthus 90% Ichthyosis 90% Kyphosis 90% Ptosis 90% Short stature 90% Optic atrophy 50% Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 7.5% Abnormality of hair texture 7.5% Abnormality of the hip bone 7.5% Abnormality of the teeth 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia affecting the eye 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the skin 7.5% Cataract 7.5% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 7.5% Foot polydactyly 7.5% Frontal bossing 7.5% Hypoplasia of the zygomatic bone 7.5% Limb undergrowth 7.5% Malar flattening 7.5% Microcornea 7.5% Sensorineural hearing impairment 7.5% Talipes 7.5% Postaxial polydactyly 5% Abnormality of pelvic girdle bone morphology - Abnormality of the pinna - Abnormality of the thorax - Alopecia - Bilateral talipes equinovarus - Concave nasal ridge - Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma - Congenital onset - Dandy-Walker malformation - Edema - Elevated 8(9)-cholestenol - Elevated 8-dehydrocholesterol - Epiphyseal stippling - Erythroderma - Failure to thrive - Flat face - Glaucoma - Hearing impairment - Hemiatrophy - Hemivertebrae - Hydronephrosis - Intellectual disability, moderate - Microphthalmia - Nystagmus - Patellar dislocation - Polyhydramnios - Postnatal growth retardation - Punctate vertebral calcifications - Scoliosis - Short neck - Sparse eyebrow - Sparse eyelashes - Stippled calcification in carpal bones - Tarsal stippling - Tracheal calcification - Tracheal stenosis - Variable expressivity - X-linked dominant inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
