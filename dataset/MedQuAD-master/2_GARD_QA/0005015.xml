			<Question qid="0005015-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Prader-Willi habitus, osteopenia, and camptodactyly ?</Question>
			<Answer>Prader-Willi habitus, osteopenia, and camptodactyly syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, short stature, obesity, genital abnormalities, and hand and/or toe contractures. It has only been described in two brothers and in one isolated case in a different family. Other symptoms included unusual face, deformity of the spinal column, osteoporosis and a history of frequent fractures. It is similar to Prader-Willi syndrome, but the authors concluded that it is a different condition. The cause was unknown in the reported cases.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0005015-2" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Prader-Willi habitus, osteopenia, and camptodactyly ?</Question>
			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Prader-Willi habitus, osteopenia, and camptodactyly? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Prader-Willi habitus, osteopenia, and camptodactyly. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal form of the vertebral bodies 90% Camptodactyly of finger 90% Camptodactyly of toe 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Hypoplasia of penis 90% Obesity 90% Recurrent fractures 90% Abnormal diaphysis morphology 50% Brachydactyly syndrome 50% Clinodactyly of the 5th finger 50% Cryptorchidism 50% Epicanthus 50% Eunuchoid habitus 50% Kyphosis 50% Overfolded helix 50% Prominent nasal bridge 50% Short foot 50% Short neck 50% Short stature 50% Strabismus 50% Toe syndactyly 50% Upslanted palpebral fissure 50% Abnormality of the philtrum 7.5% Abnormality of the ureter 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the earlobes 7.5% Abnormality of the genital system - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Camptodactyly - Enlarged epiphyses - Intellectual disability - Joint contracture of the hand - Osteopenia - Osteoporosis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
