			<Question qid="0004384-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 10 ?</Question>
			<Answer>Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 10 (CLN10-NCL) is a rare condition that affects the nervous system. Signs and symptoms of the condition can develop any time from birth to adulthood and may include progressive dementia, seizures, lack of muscle coordination, and vision loss. CLN10-NCL is caused by changes (mutations) in the CTSD gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment options are limited to therapies that can help relieve some of the symptoms.</Answer>

			<Answer>What are the signs and symptoms of Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 10 ? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 10 . If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Microcephaly 90% Respiratory insufficiency 90% Seizures 90% Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - Apnea - Ataxia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cerebellar atrophy - Cerebral atrophy - Congenital onset - Increased neuronal autofluorescent lipopigment - Intellectual disability, progressive - Intellectual disability, severe - Low-set ears - Neuronal loss in central nervous system - Premature closure of fontanelles - Respiratory failure - Retinal atrophy - Rigidity - Rod-cone dystrophy - Sloping forehead - Spasticity - Status epilepticus - Visual loss - Wide nasal bridge - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.</Answer>
