			<Question qid="0000055-5" qtype="prevention">How to prevent Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>Many Reasons for Abuse Drug abuse, whether prescription or illicit drugs, can have serious consequences, particularly for older adults. That is why prevention is key. However, there are many different reasons why people abuse drugs and become addicted to them. These reasons need to be taken into account when considering how to best prevent drug abuse. Family members, friends, pharmacists, and health care providers can all be involved in preventing drug abuse among older adults. Preventing Medication Abuse There are steps that you as a patient can take to prevent abuse of prescription medications and its consequences. - When visiting the doctor or pharmacist, bring along all prescription and over-the-counter medicines that you take -- or a list of the medicines and their dosages (how much you take and how often). Your doctor can make sure your medicines are right for you and make changes if necessary.  -  Always follow medication directions carefully.   - Only use the medication for its prescribed purpose.  - Do not crush or break pills.   - If you are not sure how to take a medicine correctly, ask your doctor or pharmacist. He or she can tell you how to take a medication properly and about side effects to watch out for and interactions with other medications.  - Ask how the medication will affect driving and other daily activities.   - Do not use other people&apos;s prescription medications, and do not share yours.  - Talk with your doctor before increasing or decreasing the medication dosage.

Talk with your doctor before increasing or decreasing the medication dosage. - Do not stop taking a medicine on your own. Talk to your doctor if you are having side effects or other problems.  - Learn about the medicines possible interactions with alcohol and other prescription and over-the-counter medicines, and follow your doctors instructions to avoid these interactions.   - Answer honestly if a doctor or other health care professional asks you about other drug or alcohol use. Without that information, your doctor may not be able to provide you with the best care. Also, if you have a substance problem, he or she can help you find the right treatment to prevent more serious problems from developing, including addiction.

For tips on safe use of medicines for older adults, see  Taking Medicines Safely.&quot;  Preventing Illicit Drug Use Preventing illicit drug use in older adults requires first knowing what contributes to it. For people of all ages, an individuals biology (including their genetics) and the environment, as well as how the two act together, determine a persons vulnerability to drug abuse and addiction -- or can protect against it. For example, being exposed to drugs of abuse in youth, living in a community where drug use is prevalent, having untreated mental disorders, such as depression, or dealing with difficult transition periods such as retirement or loss of a spouse can all make an older adult more vulnerable to drug abuse. Prevention Requires Various Approaches Prevention efforts must focus on gaining a better understanding of the factors that promote illicit drug use in older adults. Prevention also includes finding ways to stop drug use before it worsens and leads to health problems, including addiction. Family members can play an important role by being aware of an older relatives well-being and possible drug abuse, and stepping in to help at an early stage, if necessary. Doctors should ask their older patients about potential drug abuse and make referrals as needed.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000055-9" qtype="information">What is (are) Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>Addiction is a chronic disease in which a person craves, seeks, and continues to abuse a legal (medication, alcohol, tobacco) or an illicit (illegal) drug, despite harmful consequences. People who are addicted continue to abuse the substance even though it can harm their physical or mental health, lead to accidents, or put others in danger.

			<Question qid="0000055-11" qtype="information">What is (are) Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>Physical dependence is a normal process that can happen to anyone taking a medication for a long time. It means that the body (including the brain) is adapting to the presence of the drug, and the person may require a higher dosage or a different medication to get relief; this condition is known as tolerance. They may also suffer from withdrawal or feel sick when they stop taking the medication abruptly. However, the symptoms of withdrawal can usually be prevented or managed by a physician, which is why it is so important to talk to a doctor before stopping a medication. Someone who is addicted to a drug may also be physically dependent on it, but rather than benefitting from the drugs effects, an addicted person will continue to get worse with continued or increasing drug abuse. An addicted person compulsively seeks and abuses drugs, despite their negative consequences.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000055-16" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>A persons behavior, especially changes in behavior, can signal a possible substance abuse problem. For example, you may notice that an older adult seems worried about whether a medicine is really working, or complains that a doctor refuses to write a prescription. He or she may have new problems doing everyday tasks or withdraw from family, friends, and normal activities. Other possible warning signs include - rapid increases in the amount of medication needed  - frequent requests for refills of certain medicines  - a person not seeming like themselves (showing a general lack of interest or being overly energetic)  - &quot;doctor shopping&quot; -- moving from provider to provider in an effort to get several prescriptions for the same medication  - use of more than one pharmacy  - false or forged prescriptions. rapid increases in the amount of medication needed frequent requests for refills of certain medicines a person not seeming like themselves (showing a general lack of interest or being overly energetic) &quot;doctor shopping&quot; -- moving from provider to provider in an effort to get several prescriptions for the same medication use of more than one pharmacy false or forged prescriptions.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000055-17" qtype="information">What is (are) Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>The prescription medications most commonly abused by people of any age are opioids (painkillers), depressants, and stimulants. Doctors prescribe opioids to relieve pain and, sometimes, to treat severe coughs and diarrhea. Common opioid prescription medications include the following: - morphine (MS Contin, Kadian, Avinza), which is used before and after surgical procedures to treat severe pain  - codeine (Tylenol with Codeine, Robitussin AC), which is prescribed for mild pain  - hydrocodone (Vicodin, Lortab, Zydone), which is prescribed to relieve moderate to severe pain  - oxycodone (OxyContin, Percodan, Percocet, Tylox, Roxicet), which is used to relieve moderate to severe pain   - fentanyl (Duragesic), which is a strong pain medication typically delivered through a pain patch and prescribed for severe ongoing pain  morphine (MS Contin, Kadian, Avinza), which is used before and after surgical procedures to treat severe pain codeine (Tylenol with Codeine, Robitussin AC), which is prescribed for mild pain hydrocodone (Vicodin, Lortab, Zydone), which is prescribed to relieve moderate to severe pain oxycodone (OxyContin, Percodan, Percocet, Tylox, Roxicet), which is used to relieve moderate to severe pain fentanyl (Duragesic), which is a strong pain medication typically delivered through a pain patch and prescribed for severe ongoing pain For more on opioids, see  What Are the Possible Consequences of Opioid Use and Abuse?&quot; Depressants are used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders. The types of depressants that are most commonly abused are barbiturates (Secobarbital ,Mebaral and Nembutal) and benzodiazepines (Valium, Librium, and Xanax). For more on depressants, see What Are the Possible Consequences of CNS Depressant Use and Abuse?&quot;  Stimulants are used to treat narcolepsy (a sleep disorder), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and depression that has not responded to other treatments. These medications increase alertness, attention, and energy. Stimulants include methylphenidate (Ritalin and Concerta), and amphetamines (Adderall).

			<Question qid="0000055-18" qtype="causes">What causes Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>Medications affect older people differently than younger people because aging changes how the body and brain handle these substances. As we age, our bodies change and cannot break down and get rid of substances as easily as before. This means that even a small amount of a medicine or a drug can have a strong effect. If you take medications the wrong way or abuse illicit drugs, this can have a serious effect on your health and make existing health problems worse. As people age, they may also become more sensitive to alcohols effects. For more information on the dangers of mixing alcohol and medicines, see Alcohol Use and Older Adults.&quot;</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000055-26" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>Although under federal law, marijuana is illegal to use under any circumstance, in some states doctors are allowed to prescribe it for medical use. However, solid data on marijuanas health benefits is lacking, and for smoked marijuana many health experts have concerns about the potential negative effects on the lungs and respiratory system. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved smoked marijuana to treat any disease. They have approved two medications that are chemically similar to marijuana to treat wasting disease (extreme weight loss) in people with AIDS and to treat nausea and vomiting associated with cancer treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000055-30" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>Not always. Some warning signs, such as sleep problems, falls, mood swings, anxiety, depression, and memory problems -- can also be signs of other health conditions. As a result, doctors and family members often do not realize that an older person has a drug problem, and people may not get the help they need.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000055-31" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>Depending on the substance(s) involved, treatment may include medications, behavioral treatments, or a combination. A doctor, substance abuse counselor, or other health professional can determine the right treatment for an individual. Treatment helps people reduce the powerful effects of drugs on the body and brain. In doing so, treatment helps people improve their physical health and everyday functioning and regain control of their lives. Once in treatment, older adults do just as well or better than younger adults.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000055-32" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>People can receive treatment as outpatients (they live at home and visit the doctor or other provider) or through inpatient services (they live temporarily at a special facility where they get treatment). The support of family and friends is important during the treatment process.</Answer>

	<QAPair pid="33">
			<Question qid="0000055-33" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>The first step in a substance treatment program is often detoxification (detox), the process of allowing the body to get rid of the substance. Detoxification under medical supervision allows the symptoms of withdrawal to be treated, but is not addiction treatment in and of itself. (Withdrawal is the sick, sometimes unbearable feeling that people have when trying to stop or cut down on a substance they have become addicted to or have been taking for a long time.)The type of withdrawal symptoms and how long they last vary with the substance abused. For example, withdrawal from certain stimulants may lead to fatigue, depression, and sleep problems. Unsupervised withdrawal from barbiturates and benzodiazepines can be dangerous.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000055-34" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>Different types of medications may be useful at different stages of treatment to help a person stop abusing a substance, stay in treatment, focus on learning new behavioral skills, and avoid relapse. Currently, medications are available to treat addiction to opiates, nicotine, and alcohol, but none are yet approved for treating addiction to stimulants, marijuana, or depressants. Medications for substance abuse treatment help the brain adjust to the absence of the abused substance. These medications act slowly to stave off drug cravings and prevent relapse. For example, buprenorphine, marketed as Subutex or Suboxone, is prescribed by approved physicians to treat people who are addicted to opiate drugs, such as painkillers or heroin. Buprenorphine is useful in the short-term detoxification process by helping ease withdrawal symptoms and in the long-term by staving off cravings and helping prevent relapse.

			<Question qid="0000055-35" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>Behavioral treatment helps people change the way they think about the abused substance and teaches them how to handle or avoid situations that trigger strong drug cravings. Behavioral therapies can make treatment medications more effective, help people stay in treatment longer, and prevent relapse. There are four main types of behavioral treatments. - Cognitive behavioral therapy seeks to help people recognize, avoid, and cope with situations in which they are most likely to abuse substances.

			<Question qid="0000055-37" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Prescription and Illicit Drug Abuse ?</Question>
			<Answer>Recovering from addiction is hard. Even with treatment, many people return to substance abuse, sometimes months or years after having stopped drug use. This is commonly referred to as relapse. As with most chronic diseases, relapse in addiction is not unusual, and signals a need to restart, adjust, or modify the treatment.</Answer>
