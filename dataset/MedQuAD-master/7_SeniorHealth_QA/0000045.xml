			<Answer>Medicare Part A is hospital insurance that helps cover inpatient care in hospitals. Part A also helps cover skilled nursing facility care for a limited period of time, hospice care, and home health care, if you meet certain conditions. Most people don&apos;t have to pay a monthly premium for Medicare Part A when they turn age 65 because they or a spouse paid Medicare taxes while they were working. If a person is hospitalized, Medicare helps pay for the following services. - Care - general nursing - Room - semiprivate room  - Hospital services - meals, most services and supplies Care - general nursing Room - semiprivate room Hospital services - meals, most services and supplies If a person is hospitalized, Medicare does NOT pay for the following services. - Care - private-duty nursing  - Room - private room (unless medically necessary) - Hospital services - television and telephone Care - private-duty nursing Room - private room (unless medically necessary) Hospital services - television and telephone For important information about Medicare Part A, visit http://www.medicare.gov to view or print copies of &quot;Your Medicare Benefits&quot; or &quot;Medicare &amp; You.&quot; (Under &quot;Search Tools,&quot; select &quot;Find a Medicare Publication.&quot;)</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000045-10" qtype="information">What is (are) Medicare and Continuing Care ?</Question>
			<Answer>Medicare Advantage Plans, sometimes known as Medicare Part C, are plans people can join to get their Medicare benefits. Medicare Advantage Plans are available in many areas of the country, and a person who joins one of these plans will get all Medicare-covered benefits. These plans cover hospital costs (Part A), medical costs (Part B), and sometimes prescription drug costs (Part D). Medicare Advantage Plans may also offer extra coverage, such as vision, hearing, dental, and/or health and wellness programs. Medicare Advantage Plans are managed by private insurance companies approved by Medicare. To join a Medicare Advantage Plan, a person must have Medicare Part A and Part B and must pay the monthly Medicare Part B premium to Medicare. In addition, it might be necessary to pay a monthly premium to the Medicare Advantage Plan for the extra benefits that they offer. In most of these plans, there are generally extra benefits and lower co-payments than in Original Medicare. (See Question #6 for information about Original Medicare.) However, a person may have to see doctors that belong to the plan or go to certain hospitals to get services. A person can switch plans each year in the fall if desired. To find out what Medicare Advantage Plans are available in your area, visit http://www.medicare.gov and choose the link Compare Health Plans and Medigap Policies in Your Area to use the Medicare Options Compare tool, or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000045-11" qtype="information">What is (are) Medicare and Continuing Care ?</Question>
			<Answer>Medicare Part D helps pay for medications that a doctor may prescribe. This coverage may help lower prescription drug costs. Medicare drug plans are run by insurance companies and other private companies approved by Medicare. A person who joins Original Medicare and who wants prescription drug coverage will need to choose and sign up for a Medicare Prescription Drug plan (PDP). A person who joins one of the Medicare Advantage Plans will automatically receive prescription drug coverage through that plan if it&apos;s offered, usually for an extra cost. For more information about Medicare Part D, visit http://www.medicare.gov to get free copies of &quot;Your Guide to Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage&quot; and &quot;Compare Medicare Prescription Drug Plans.&quot; (Under &quot;Search Tools,&quot; select &quot;Find a Medicare Publication.&quot;) You may also call 1-800-Medicare (1-800-633-4227).

			<Question qid="0000045-12" qtype="information">What is (are) Medicare and Continuing Care ?</Question>
			<Answer>Original Medicare is managed by the Federal government and lets people with Medicare go to any doctor, hospital or other health care provider who accepts Medicare. It is a fee-for-service plan, meaning that the person with Medicare usually pays a fee for each service. Medicare pays its share of an approved amount up to certain limits, and the person with Medicare pays the rest. People in Original Medicare must choose and join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan if they want to get Medicare prescription drug coverage.

			<Question qid="0000045-13" qtype="information">What is (are) Medicare and Continuing Care ?</Question>
			<Answer>People who choose Original Medicare may wish to consider Medigap, a type of Medicare supplement insurance. Medigap policies are sold by private insurance companies to fill gaps in Original Medicare Plan coverage, such as out-of-pocket costs for Medicare co-insurance and deductibles, or for services not covered by Medicare. A Medigap policy only works with Original Medicare. A person who joins a Medicare Advantage Plan generally doesn&apos;t need (and can&apos;t use) a Medigap policy. For more information about Medigap policies, visit  http://www.medicare.gov to view a copy of &quot;Choosing a Medigap Policy: A Guide to Health Insurance for People with Medicare.&quot; (Under &quot;Search Tools,&quot; select &quot;Find a Medicare Publication.&quot;) You can also call 1-800-Medicare (1-800-633-4227).

			<Question qid="0000045-14" qtype="information">What is (are) Medicare and Continuing Care ?</Question>
			<Answer>Some people think that Medicare and Medicaid are the same. Actually, they are two different programs. Medicaid is a state-run program that provides hospital and medical coverage for people with low income and little or no resources. Each state has its own rules about who is eligible and what is covered under Medicaid. Some people qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid. If you have questions about Medicaid, you can call your State Medical Assistance (Medicaid) office for more information. Visit  http://www.medicare.gov on the web.

			<Question qid="0000045-21" qtype="considerations">What to do for Medicare and Continuing Care ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nursing home care can be very expensive. Medicare generally doesn&apos;t cover nursing home care. There are many ways people can pay for nursing home care. For example, they can use their own money, they may be able to get help from their state, or they may use long-term care insurance. Nursing home care isn&apos;t covered by many types of health insurance. Most people who enter nursing homes begin by paying for their care out of their own pocket. As they use up their resources over a period of time, they may eventually become eligible for Medicaid. Medicaid is a state and Federal program that will pay most nursing home costs for people with limited income and resources. Eligibility varies by state. Medicaid pays for care for about 7 out of every 10 nursing home residents. Medicaid will pay for nursing home care only when provided in a Medicaid-certified facility. For information about Medicaid eligibility, call your state Medical Assistance (Medicaid) Office. If you have questions about Medicaid, you can call your State Medical Assistance (Medicaid) office for more information. Visit http://www.medicare.gov on the web. (Under &quot;Search Tools,&quot; select &quot;Find Helpful Phone Numbers and Websites.&quot;) Or, call 1-800-Medicare (1-800-633-4227) to get the telephone number.

			<Question qid="0000045-22" qtype="information">What is (are) Medicare and Continuing Care ?</Question>
			<Answer>Medicare does cover skilled nursing care after a 3-day qualifying hospital stay. Skilled care is health care given when the person needs skilled nursing or rehabilitation staff to manage, observe, and evaluate his or her care. Care that can be given by non-professional staff isn&apos;t considered skilled care. Medicare does not cover custodial care or adult day care. For more information on Medicare coverage of skilled nursing facility care, visit http://www.medicare.gov to look at or print a copy of the booklet &quot;Medicare Coverage of Skilled Nursing Facility Care.&quot; (Under &quot;Search Tools,&quot; select &quot;Find a Medicare Publication.&quot;) You can also call 1-800-Medicare (1-800-633-4227) to find out if a free copy can be mailed to you.

			<Question qid="0000045-24" qtype="information">What is (are) Medicare and Continuing Care ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hospice care is a special way of caring for people who are terminally ill (dying) and helping their families cope. Hospice care includes treatment to relieve symptoms and keep the individual comfortable. The goal is to provide end-of-life care, not to cure the illness. Medical care, nursing care, social services, drugs for the terminal and related conditions, durable medical equipment, and other types of items and services can be a part of hospice care.</Answer>
