			<Question qid="0000034-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Heart Failure ?</Question>
			<Answer>In heart failure, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body&apos;s needs. In some cases, the heart cannot fill with enough blood. In other cases, the heart can&apos;t pump blood to the rest of the body with enough force. Some people have both problems. Heart failure develops over time as the pumping action of the heart gets weaker. It can affect either the right, the left, or both sides of the heart. Heart failure does not mean that the heart has stopped working or is about to stop working. When heart failure affects the left side of the heart, the heart cannot pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. When heart failure affects the right side, the heart cannot pump enough blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. The Heart&apos;s Pumping Action In normal hearts, blood vessels called veins bring oxygen-poor blood from the body to the right side of the heart. It is then pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, picking up oxygen. From there, the blood returns to the left side of the heart. Then it is pumped through a large artery called the aorta that distributes blood throughout the body. When the heart is weakened by heart failure, blood and fluid can back up into the lungs, and fluid builds up in the feet, ankles, and legs. People with heart failure often experience tiredness and shortness of breath. Heart Failure is Serious Heart failure is a serious and common condition. Scientists estimate that 5 million people in the U.S. have heart failure and that number is growing. It contributes to 300,000 deaths each year. Heart failure is most common in those age 65 and older and it is the number one reason older people are hospitalized. Other Names for Heart Failure Heart failure can also be called congestive heart failure, systolic heart failure, diastolic heart failure, left-sided heart failure, or right-sided heart failure.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000034-2" qtype="causes">What causes Heart Failure ?</Question>
			<Answer>Heart failure is caused by other diseases or conditions that damage the heart muscle such as coronary artery disease (including heart attacks), diabetes, and high blood pressure. Treating these problems can prevent or improve heart failure. Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death in men and women. It happens when the arteries that supply blood to the heart become hardened and narrowed. High Blood Pressure High blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can weaken your heart and lead to plaque buildup, which can then lead to heart failure. Diabetes Diabetes is characterized by having too much glucose, or sugar, in the blood for a long time. This can cause heart problems because high blood glucose can damage parts of the body such as the heart and blood vessels. This damage weakens the heart, often leading to heart failure. Other Diseases Other diseases and conditions also can lead to heart failure, such as - Cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee), or heart muscle disease. Cardiomyopathy may be present at birth or caused by injury or infection.   - Heart valve disease. Problems with the heart valves may be present at birth or caused by infection, heart attack, or damage from heart disease.   - Arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), or irregular heartbeats. These heart problems may be present at birth or caused by heart disease or heart defects.   - Congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defects. These problems with the heart&apos;s structure are present at birth.  Cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee), or heart muscle disease. Cardiomyopathy may be present at birth or caused by injury or infection. Heart valve disease. Problems with the heart valves may be present at birth or caused by infection, heart attack, or damage from heart disease. Arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), or irregular heartbeats. These heart problems may be present at birth or caused by heart disease or heart defects. Congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defects. These problems with the heart&apos;s structure are present at birth. Other Factors Other factors also can injure the heart muscle and lead to heart failure. Examples include - treatments for cancer, such as radiation and chemotherapy   - thyroid disorders (having either too much or too little thyroid hormone in the body)  - alcohol abuse or cocaine and other illegal drug use   - HIV/AIDS   - too much vitamin E.  treatments for cancer, such as radiation and chemotherapy thyroid disorders (having either too much or too little thyroid hormone in the body) alcohol abuse or cocaine and other illegal drug use HIV/AIDS too much vitamin E. Sleep Apnea Heart damage from obstructive sleep apnea may worsen heart failure. Sleep apnea is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Sleep apnea can deprive your heart of oxygen and increase its workload. Treating this sleep disorder might improve heart failure. Who Is at Risk? Heart failure can happen to almost anyone. It is the number one reason for hospitalization for people over age 65. Heart failure is more common in - people who are 65 years old or older   - African-Americans  - people who are overweight  - people who have had a heart attack  - men.  people who are 65 years old or older African-Americans people who are overweight people who have had a heart attack men. Aging can weaken the heart muscle. Older people also may have had diseases for many years that led to heart failure. African Americans are more likely to have heart failure than people of other races. They&apos;re also more likely to have symptoms at a younger age, have more hospital visits due to heart failure, and die from heart failure.  Excess weight puts strain on the heart. Being overweight also increases your risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. These diseases can lead to heart failure. A history of a heart attack puts people at greater risk for heart failure. Men have a higher rate of heart failure than women.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000034-3" qtype="susceptibility">Who is at risk for Heart Failure? ?</Question>
			<Answer>Preventing Heart Failure There are a number of things you can do to reduce the risk for coronary artery disease and heart failure. These things include - keeping your cholesterol levels healthy  - keeping your blood pressure at a normal level  - managing diabetes   - maintaining a healthy weight   - quitting smoking  - limiting the amount of alcohol you drink  - following a heart healthy diet  - limiting the amount of sodium (salt) you consume  - getting regular exercise   - avoiding using illegal drugs. keeping your cholesterol levels healthy keeping your blood pressure at a normal level managing diabetes maintaining a healthy weight quitting smoking limiting the amount of alcohol you drink following a heart healthy diet limiting the amount of sodium (salt) you consume getting regular exercise avoiding using illegal drugs. Keep Your Cholesterol Levels Healthy Keeping your cholesterol levels healthy can help prevent coronary artery disease. Your goal for LDL, or &quot;bad,&quot; cholesterol, depends on how many other risk factors you have. Risk factors include - being a cigarette smoker  -  having high blood pressure   -  having low HDL cholesterol  -  being 45 or older if you are a man and 55 or older if you are a woman  -  having a close relative who had coronary artery disease at an earlier-than-usual age (before age 55 for male relatives and before age 65 for female relatives).  being a cigarette smoker having high blood pressure having low HDL cholesterol being 45 or older if you are a man and 55 or older if you are a woman having a close relative who had coronary artery disease at an earlier-than-usual age (before age 55 for male relatives and before age 65 for female relatives). Recommended LDL Cholesterol Goals -  If you don&apos;t have coronary heart disease or diabetes and have one or no risk factors, your LDL goal is less than 160 mg/dL.  - If you don&apos;t have coronary heart disease or diabetes and have two or more risk factors, your LDL goal is less than 130 mg/dL.  - If you do have coronary heart disease or diabetes, your LDL goal is less than 100 mg/dL.   - The goal for HDL, or &quot;good,&quot; cholesterol is above 40 in men and above 50 in women.  - The goal for triglycerides, another fat in the blood, is below 150.  If you don&apos;t have coronary heart disease or diabetes and have one or no risk factors, your LDL goal is less than 160 mg/dL. If you don&apos;t have coronary heart disease or diabetes and have two or more risk factors, your LDL goal is less than 130 mg/dL. If you do have coronary heart disease or diabetes, your LDL goal is less than 100 mg/dL. The goal for HDL, or &quot;good,&quot; cholesterol is above 40 in men and above 50 in women. The goal for triglycerides, another fat in the blood, is below 150. Learn how to control your cholesterol with TLC -- Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes.  Keep Blood Pressure at a Normal Level High blood pressure causes the heart to get larger and work harder, which can then lead to heart failure. You should aim for a blood pressure level of 130/80 or below. Talk to your doctor about ways to lower your blood pressure.  Get tips on how to control your blood pressure.  Manage Diabetes If you have diabetes, its important to manage it properly. Diabetes is characterized by having too much glucose, or sugar, in the blood for a long time. This can cause heart problems because high blood glucose can damage parts of the body such as the heart and blood vessels. This damage weakens the heart, often leading to heart failure. See ways to manage your diabetes every day.  Maintain a Healthy Weight Excess weight puts strain on the heart. Being overweight also increases your risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. These diseases can lead to heart failure.  See a sensible approach to weight loss.  Don&apos;t Smoke If you smoke, quit. For free help quitting, call a smoking quit line.  See medications to help you quit.  Follow a Heart Healthy Diet Heart-healthy foods include those high in fiber, such as oat bran, oatmeal, whole-grain breads and cereals, fruits, and vegetables. You can also maintain a heart-healthy diet by limiting foods that are high in saturated fat, trans-fat, and cholesterol, such as meats, butter, dairy products with fat, eggs, shortening, lard, and foods with palm oil or coconut oil. For more on healthy eating, see Eating Well As You Get Older. Limit the Amount of Alcohol You Drink In general, healthy men and women over age 65 should not drink more than three drinks a day or a total of seven drinks a week. Learn how alcohol affects you as get older.  Limit the Amount of Sodium Sodium contributes to high blood pressure and fluid retention. Older adults should limit their intake of sodium to1,500 milligrams daily (about 2/3 tsp. of salt).  See ways to cut back on your salt intake.  Get Regular Exericse Studies show that people with heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure benefit from regular exercise. In fact, inactive people are nearly twice as likely to develop heart disease as those who are more active. Aim for at least 30 minutes a day of exercise. Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program.

			<Question qid="0000034-4" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Heart Failure ?</Question>
			<Answer>Common Symptoms The most common symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, feeling tired, and swelling. Swelling usually occurs in the ankles, feet, legs, and sometimes in the abdomen. Swelling is caused by fluid buildup in the body. The fluid buildup can lead to weight gain as well as a cough. The cough can be worse at night and when lying down. When symptoms first begin, you might feel tired or short of breath after routine physical activities, such as climbing stairs. As heart failure progresses, the symptoms get worse. You may feel tired or short of breath after performing simple activities, like getting dressed.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000034-5" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Heart Failure ?</Question>
			<Answer>Diagnosing Heart Failure There is not one specific test to diagnose heart failure. Because the symptoms are common for other conditions, your doctor will determine if you have heart failure by doing a detailed medical history, an examination, and several tests. The tests will identify whether you have any diseases or conditions that can cause heart failure. They will also rule out any other causes of your symptoms and determine the amount of damage to your heart. During a physical examination, you can expect your doctor to listen to your heart for abnormal sounds and listen to your lungs for a buildup of fluid. Your doctor will also look for swelling in your ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and in the veins in your neck If your doctor determines that you have signs of heart failure, he or she may order several tests. Diagnostic Tests Tests that are given to determine heart failure include an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG), a chest x-ray, and a BNP blood test. An EKG or ECG  -- electrocardiogram -- measures the rate and regularity of your heartbeat. This test can also show if you have had a heart attack and whether the walls of your heart have thickened. A chest X-ray takes a picture of your heart and lungs. It will show whether your heart is enlarged or your lungs have fluid in them, both signs of heart failure. A BNP blood test measures the level of a hormone in your blood called BNP -- brain natriuretic peptide -- that increases in heart failure. Once these initial tests have been performed, your doctor may decide to send you to a cardiologist, a specialist in the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. A cardiologist will perform a physical exam and may order other tests. Other Tests Tests that can identify the cause of heart failure include an echocardiogram, a Holter monitor, and an exercise stress test. An echocardiogram is one of the most useful tests for diagnosing heart failure. This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart and shows how well the heart is filling with blood. Your doctor uses this test to determine whether any areas of your heart are damaged. A Holter monitor, which is a small box that is attached to patches placed on your chest. The monitor, which is worn for 24 hours, provides a continuous recording of heart rhythm during normal activity. An exercise stress test captures your EKG and blood pressure before, during, or after exercise to see how your heart responds to exercise. This test tells doctors how your heart responds to activity.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000034-6" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Heart Failure ?</Question>
			<Answer>There is no cure for heart failure, but it can be controlled by treating the underlying conditions that cause it. Treatment for heart failure will depend on the type and stage of heart failure (the severity of the condition). The goals for treatment of all stages of heart failure are to reduce symptoms, treat the cause (such as heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes), stop the disease from worsening, and prolong life. Treatments for Heart Failure Treatments for heart failure include - lifestyle changes  - medications  - specialized care for those who are in the advanced stages. lifestyle changes medications specialized care for those who are in the advanced stages. Treatment for heart failure will reduce the chances that you will have to go to the hospital and make it easier for you to do the things you like to do. It is very important that you follow your treatment plan by keeping doctor appointments, taking medications, and making lifestyle changes.</Answer>
