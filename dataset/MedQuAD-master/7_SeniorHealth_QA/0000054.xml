			<Question qid="0000054-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Peripheral Arterial Disease (P.A.D.) ?</Question>
			<Answer>Arteries Clogged With Plaque Peripheral arterial disease (P.A.D.) is a disease in which plaque (plak) builds up in the arteries that carry blood to your head, organs, and limbs. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, fibrous tissue, and other substances in the blood. When plaque builds up in the body&apos;s arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ATH-er-o-skler-O-sis). Over time, plaque can harden and narrow the arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body. P.A.D. usually affects the arteries in the legs, but it can also affect the arteries that carry blood from your heart to your head, arms, kidneys, and stomach. Blocked blood flow to your legs can cause pain and numbness. It also can raise your risk of getting an infection in the affected limbs. Your body may have a hard time fighting the infection. Why is P.A.D. Dangerous? Over time, the plaque may crack and cause blood clots to form. These blood clots can block arteries, causing pain, numbness, inflammation, and even permanent tissue damage in the affected part of the body. If severe enough, blocked blood flow can cause tissue death (also called gangrene.) In very serious cases, this can lead to leg amputation. P.A.D. currently affects 8 million to 12 million Americans. About 1 in every 20 Americans over the age of 50 has P.A.D. African Americans are more than twice as likely as Caucasians to have P.A.D. If you have P.A.D., your risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke, and transient ischemic attack (&quot;mini-stroke&quot;) is much higher than in people without P.A.D. If you have coronary artery disease, you have a 1 in 3 chance of having blocked leg arteries. Although P.A.D. is serious, it is treatable. If you have the disease, it&apos;s important to see your doctor regularly and treat the underlying atherosclerosis. Other Names for Peripheral Arterial Disease -  Atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease   -  Claudication (klaw-dih-KA-shen)   -  Hardening of the arteries   -  Leg cramps from poor circulation   -  Peripheral vascular disease   -  Poor circulation   -  Vascular disease  Atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease Claudication (klaw-dih-KA-shen) Hardening of the arteries Leg cramps from poor circulation Peripheral vascular disease Poor circulation Vascular disease</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000054-2" qtype="prevention">How to prevent Peripheral Arterial Disease (P.A.D.) ?</Question>
			<Answer>What Causes P.A.D.? The most common cause of P.A.D. is atherosclerosis, a buildup of plaque in the arteries. The exact cause of atherosclerosis isn&apos;t known. Certain people are at higher risk for developing atherosclerosis. The disease may start if certain factors damage the inner layers of the arteries. These factors include - smoking  - high amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood   - high blood pressure   - high amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes. smoking high amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood high blood pressure high amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes. The major risk factors for P.A.D. are smoking, older age, and having certain diseases or conditions. The Effects of Smoking Smoking is the main risk factor for P.A.D. Your risk of P.A.D. increases four times if you smoke or have a history of smoking. On average, people who smoke and develop P.A.D. have symptoms 10 years earlier than people who don&apos;t smoke and develop P.A.D. Quitting smoking slows the progress of P.A.D. Smoking even one or two cigarettes a day can interfere with P.A.D. treatments. People who smoke and people who have diabetes are at highest risk for P.A.D. complications such as gangrene (tissue death) in the leg from decreased blood flow. Older Age Older age also is a risk factor for P.A.D. Plaque builds up in your arteries as you age. About 1 in every 20 Americans over the age of 50 has P.A.D. The risk continues to rise as you get older. Older age combined with other factors, such as smoking or diabetes, also puts you at higher risk for P.A.D. Diseases That Put You at Risk Many diseases and conditions can raise your risk of P.A.D., including - diabetes. About 1 in 3 people older than 50 who has diabetes also has P.A.D.  - high blood pressure   - high blood cholesterol   - coronary heart disease (CHD)   - stroke   - metabolic syndrome (a group of risk factors that raise your risk of CHD and other health problems, such as P.A.D., stroke, and diabetes).  diabetes. About 1 in 3 people older than 50 who has diabetes also has P.A.D. high blood pressure high blood cholesterol coronary heart disease (CHD) stroke metabolic syndrome (a group of risk factors that raise your risk of CHD and other health problems, such as P.A.D., stroke, and diabetes). A family history of these conditions makes P.A.D. more likely. Reducing Your Risk for P.A.D. Taking action to control your risk factors can help prevent or delay P.A.D. There are several helpful lifestyle changes you can make. - Quit smoking. Smoking is the biggest risk factor for P.A.D.  - Eat a healthy diet. Look for foods that are low in total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium (salt).  - Get regular exercise and physical activity. Quit smoking. Smoking is the biggest risk factor for P.A.D. Eat a healthy diet. Look for foods that are low in total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium (salt). Get regular exercise and physical activity. These lifestyle changes can reduce your risk for P.A.D. and its complications. They can also help prevent and control conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure that can lead to P.A.D.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000054-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Peripheral Arterial Disease (P.A.D.) ?</Question>
			<Answer>Common Symptoms Some people with P.A.D. do not have any symptoms. Others may have a number of signs and symptoms. People who have P.A.D. may notice symptoms when walking or climbing stairs. These symptoms may include pain, aching, or heaviness in the leg muscles. Symptoms may also include - pain  - aching, or heaviness in the leg muscles  - cramping in the affected leg(s) and in the buttocks, thighs, calves, and feet. pain aching, or heaviness in the leg muscles cramping in the affected leg(s) and in the buttocks, thighs, calves, and feet. They may go away after resting. These symptoms are called intermittent claudication (klaw-dih-KA-shen). If You Have Leg Pain If you have leg pain when you walk or climb stairs, talk to your doctor. Sometimes older people think that leg pain is part of aging when it could be P.A.D. Tell your doctor if you&apos;re feeling pain in your legs, and discuss whether you should be tested for P.A.D. Other Possible Signs Possible signs of P.A.D. include - weak or absent pulses in the legs or feet  - sores or wounds on the toes, feet, or legs that heal slowly, poorly, or not at all  - a pale or bluish color to the skin  - a lower temperature in one leg compared to the other leg  - poor toenail growth and decreased leg hair growth  - erectile dysfunction, especially in men who have diabetes. weak or absent pulses in the legs or feet sores or wounds on the toes, feet, or legs that heal slowly, poorly, or not at all a pale or bluish color to the skin a lower temperature in one leg compared to the other leg poor toenail growth and decreased leg hair growth erectile dysfunction, especially in men who have diabetes. Should I be Checked for P.A.D.? Even if you don&apos;t have symptoms or signs of P.A.D., you could still have the disease. Ask your doctor whether you should get checked for P.A.D. if you are - age 70 or older  - age 50 or older and have a history of smoking or diabetes   - younger than 50 years old and have diabetes and one or more risk factors for atherosclerosis. These risk factors include high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, smoking, and being overweight. age 70 or older age 50 or older and have a history of smoking or diabetes younger than 50 years old and have diabetes and one or more risk factors for atherosclerosis.

			<Question qid="0000054-4" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Peripheral Arterial Disease (P.A.D.) ?</Question>
			<Answer>Your Family and Medical History P.A.D. is diagnosed based on a person&apos;s medical and family histories, a physical exam, and results from medical tests. To learn about your medical and family histories, your doctor may ask about - your risk factors for P.A.D. For example, he or she may ask whether you smoke or have diabetes.   - your symptoms, including any symptoms that occur when walking, exercising, sitting, standing, or climbing  - your diet  - any medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines   - family members with a history of heart or blood vessel diseases. your risk factors for P.A.D. For example, he or she may ask whether you smoke or have diabetes. your symptoms, including any symptoms that occur when walking, exercising, sitting, standing, or climbing your diet any medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines family members with a history of heart or blood vessel diseases. The Physical Exam During the physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of P.A.D. He or she may check the blood flow in your legs or feet to see whether you have weak or absent pulses. Your doctor also may check the pulses in your leg arteries for an abnormal whooshing sound called a bruit (broo-E). He or she can hear this sound with a stethoscope. A bruit may be a warning sign of a narrowed or blocked artery. Your doctor may compare blood pressure between your limbs to see whether the pressure is lower in the affected limb. He or she may also check for poor wound healing or any changes in your hair, skin, or nails that might be signs of P.A.D. Diagnostic Tests Tests are used to diagnose P.A.D. These tests include - an ankle-brachial index (ABI). This test compares blood pressure in your ankle to blood pressure in your arm and shows how well blood is flowing in your limbs. ABI can show whether P.A.D. is affecting your limbs, but it wont show which blood vessels are narrowed or blocked. A normal ABI result is 1.0 or greater (with a range of 0.90 to 1.30). The test takes about 10 to 15 minutes to measure both arms and both ankles. This test may be done yearly to see whether P.A.D. is getting worse. an ankle-brachial index (ABI). This test compares blood pressure in your ankle to blood pressure in your arm and shows how well blood is flowing in your limbs. ABI can show whether P.A.D. is affecting your limbs, but it wont show which blood vessels are narrowed or blocked. A normal ABI result is 1.0 or greater (with a range of 0.90 to 1.30). The test takes about 10 to 15 minutes to measure both arms and both ankles. This test may be done yearly to see whether P.A.D. is getting worse. - a Doppler ultrasound. This test looks at blood flow in the major arteries and veins in the limbs. During this test, a handheld device is placed on your body and passed back and forth over the affected area. A computer converts sound waves into a picture of blood flow in the arteries and veins. The results of this test can show whether a blood vessel is blocked. The results also can help show the severity of P.A.D.  a Doppler ultrasound. This test looks at blood flow in the major arteries and veins in the limbs.

The results of this test can show whether a blood vessel is blocked. The results also can help show the severity of P.A.D. - a treadmill test. This test shows if you have any problems during normal walking, how severe your symptoms are, and what level of exercise brings on your symptoms. You may have an ABI test before and after the treadmill test. This will help compare blood flow in your arms and legs before and after exercise. a treadmill test. This test shows if you have any problems during normal walking, how severe your symptoms are, and what level of exercise brings on your symptoms. You may have an ABI test before and after the treadmill test. This will help compare blood flow in your arms and legs before and after exercise. - a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA). This test uses magnetic and radio waves to take pictures of your blood vessels. This test is a type of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRA can show the location and severity of a blocked blood vessel. If you have a pacemaker, man-made joint, stent, surgical clips, mechanical heart valve, or other metallic devices in your body, you might not be able to have an MRA. Ask your doctor whether an MRA is an option for you. a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA). This test uses magnetic and radio waves to take pictures of your blood vessels.

			<Question qid="0000054-15" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Peripheral Arterial Disease (P.A.D.) ?</Question>
			<Answer>Yes. In some people, lifestyle changes are not enough to control P.A.D. Surgery and other procedures may be needed. These may include bypass grafting surgery, angioplasty, a stent, or a procedure called atherectomy (ath-eh-REK-to-mee). - Your doctor may recommend bypass grafting surgery if blood flow in your limb is blocked or nearly blocked. In this type of surgery, a blood vessel from another part of the body or a man-made tube is used to make a graft. This graft bypasses (goes around) the blocked part of the artery, which allows blood to flow around the blockage. This surgery doesn&apos;t cure P.A.D., but it may increase blood flow to the affected limb.  Your doctor may recommend bypass grafting surgery if blood flow in your limb is blocked or nearly blocked.
