			<Question qid="0000067-13" qtype="exams and tests">How to diagnose Surviving Cancer ?</Question>
			<Answer>Older adults are more likely to have chronic health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. Managing these conditions can complicate treatment and affect the time it takes to recover. Also, older people&apos;s bodies metabolize, or break down, drugs at a slower rate than younger people, and this can have an effect on the way medicines are tolerated. For instance, some older adults may not be able to tolerate high doses of chemotherapy (cancer-fighting drugs) and radiation that are used to treat cancer.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000067-30" qtype="information">What is (are) Surviving Cancer ?</Question>
			<Answer>Bladder and bowel problems are among the most upsetting issues people face after cancer treatment. People often feel ashamed or fearful to go out in public, because they worry about having an &quot;accident.&quot; This loss of control can happen after treatment for bladder, prostate, colon, rectal, ovarian, or other gynecologic or abdominal cancers. Some surgeries to treat cancer may leave a patient with little or no bladder or bowel control. The opposite problem can happen with some medicines that cause constipation. For some people the problems improve over time, but others may experience long-term issues. It is very important to tell your doctor about any changes in your bladder or bowel habits. Several things may help, such as medications, changes in diet or fluid intake, and exercises. Joining a support group also may be helpful, especially for survivors who have an ostomy (an opening in the body to pass waste material).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000067-31" qtype="information">What is (are) Surviving Cancer ?</Question>
			<Answer>For many older adults, intimacy remains an important need. Cancer and cancer treatment can have a major impact on intimacy and sexual functions for both men and women. Problems are often caused by physical changes, such as erectile dysfunction or incontinence which can occur after prostate surgery. Other problems are caused by emotional issues like changes in body image because of scarring or the loss of a breast. Loss of interest in or desire for intimacy can occur and be particularly troublesome. Often, sexual problems will not get better on their own, so it is important to talk with your doctor. He or she can suggest a treatment depending on the type of problem and its cause. A variety of interventions, such as medications, devices, surgery, exercises to strengthen genital muscles, or counseling can help.
