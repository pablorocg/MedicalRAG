			<Question qid="0000059-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Psoriasis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Psoriasis (sow RYE uh sis) is a chronic skin disease. Chronic means that it lasts a long time, often a lifetime. Psoriasis affects more than 5 million adults in the United States. It appears about equally in males and females. Psoriasis occurs when the skin cells grow too quickly. The body does not shed these excess cells and they build up on the surface of the skin, forming thick, scaly patches.   Types of Psoriasis Psoriasis occurs in five different forms that affect both men and women. Most people have only one type of psoriasis at a time. Sometimes, one type of psoriasis will disappear and another will appear. Here is a brief overview of the different forms of psoriasis. - Is the most common form  - appears as raised red patches covered in silvery white scales   - usually shows up on the scalp, knees, elbows and lower back   - patches may itch or be painful and can also crack and bleed.  Is the most common form appears as raised red patches covered in silvery white scales usually shows up on the scalp, knees, elbows and lower back patches may itch or be painful and can also crack and bleed. - is the second most common form of psoriasis  - usually begins in childhood or early adulthood   - appears as small red spots on the skin.  is the second most common form of psoriasis usually begins in childhood or early adulthood appears as small red spots on the skin. - appears as red sores in body folds, such as the groin and under the breasts  - is more common in people who are overweight   - often occurs along with another form of psoriasis.  appears as red sores in body folds, such as the groin and under the breasts is more common in people who are overweight often occurs along with another form of psoriasis. - features white blisters surrounded by red skin  - mainly affects adults  - may occur all over the body, but usually affects one area.  features white blisters surrounded by red skin mainly affects adults may occur all over the body, but usually affects one area. - is the rarest and most dangerous form of psoriasis   - is characterized by inflammation  - usually affects most of the body.  is the rarest and most dangerous form of psoriasis is characterized by inflammation usually affects most of the body.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000059-2" qtype="causes">What causes Psoriasis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Although the cause of psoriasis is not completely understood, scientists believe it is related to a problem with a type of blood cells called T cells. These cells normally travel through the bloodstream to help fight an infection, but in people with psoriasis, they attack the bodys skin cells by mistake. Genes Play a Role No one knows what causes T cells to go wrong, but certain genes have been linked to psoriasis. People who have these genes are more likely to develop psoriasis than people without the genes. However, genes alone do not cause psoriasis. Scientists believe psoriasis occurs when something in the environment triggers the disease in someone who has one or more of these genes.  Psoriasis Triggers These so-called triggers may be different for different people. Different triggers may start the disease or make it worse in different people. Factors that may trigger psoriasis or make it worse include - physical and emotional stress  - injury to the skin such as cuts or burns  - infections, particularly strep throat  - cold weather   - smoking or heavy alcohol use  - certain medications such as     - lithium, a psychiatric drug   - antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine    - inderal, a high blood pressure medicine   - quinidine, a heart medication   - indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used to treat arthritis.   physical and emotional stress injury to the skin such as cuts or burns infections, particularly strep throat cold weather smoking or heavy alcohol use certain medications such as - lithium, a psychiatric drug  - antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine   - inderal, a high blood pressure medicine  - quinidine, a heart medication  - indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used to treat arthritis. lithium, a psychiatric drug antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine inderal, a high blood pressure medicine quinidine, a heart medication indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used to treat arthritis.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000059-3" qtype="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Psoriasis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Different forms of psoriasis have different symptoms. In many cases your doctor can diagnose psoriasis based on the signs seen in the physical exam as well as the symptoms you describe. Symptoms The most common symptoms of psoriasis are - patches of thick, red skin   - skin inflammation  - silvery scales  - itching  - pain. patches of thick, red skin skin inflammation silvery scales itching pain. Psoriasis most commonly affects the elbows, knees, scalp, lower back, face, palms, soles of the feet, nails, and soft tissues. Making a Diagnosis In most cases, your primary care provider can diagnose psoriasis simply by examining your skin. Because the symptoms of psoriasis may be similar to those of other skin diseases, however, sometimes the diagnosis is more difficult. You may need to see a dermatologist, a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating skin diseases. If your doctor isn&apos;t sure if you have psoriasis, he or she may order a biopsy. This involves removing a small sample of skin and looking at it under a microscope.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000059-4" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Psoriasis ?</Question>
			<Answer>The goals of psoriasis treatment are to change the course of the disease by interfering with the increased production of skin cells, and to remove scales and smooth rough skin. There are many types of treatments. Many are medicines and other treatments your doctor will have to prescribe. But there are other types of treatments you can buy without a prescription or try on your own. Some treatments for psoriasis are applied directly to the skin. Some use light to treat skin lesions. Others are taken by mouth or injected. This chapter focuses on treatments that are applied directly to the skin -- also called topical treatments or light therapy.  Topical Treatments Here are some different types of topical treatments for psoriasis. - helps soften and loosen skin scales  - comes as a cream, lotion, liquid, gel, ointment or shampoo. helps soften and loosen skin scales comes as a cream, lotion, liquid, gel, ointment or shampoo. - reduce inflammation and slow the growth and build-up of skin cells   - are used in different strengths for different parts of the body.  reduce inflammation and slow the growth and build-up of skin cells are used in different strengths for different parts of the body. - works by slowing the production of skin cells   - is often combined with a steroid for added effects   - may be used with UVB light.  works by slowing the production of skin cells is often combined with a steroid for added effects may be used with UVB light. - is used to treat long-term psoriasis and hard-to-treat plaques  - reduces inflammation   - slows down the growth of skin cells. is used to treat long-term psoriasis and hard-to-treat plaques reduces inflammation slows down the growth of skin cells. - cause the skin to shed dead cells  - slow the growth of skin cells   - decrease itching.  cause the skin to shed dead cells slow the growth of skin cells decrease itching. - are believed to work by reducing skin cell overgrowth  - decrease inflammation  - are often used with other treatments.  are believed to work by reducing skin cell overgrowth decrease inflammation are often used with other treatments. - slow down the growth of skin cells   - may be used with steroid creams for added effects.  slow down the growth of skin cells may be used with steroid creams for added effects. Regardless of the topical medication your doctor prescribes, it is important to follow directions carefully. Some can be messy and stain your clothing and bedding. Others can have potentially dangerous side effects. Light Therapy Light therapy, also called phototherapy, uses ultraviolet light to treat skin lesions. Laser therapy delivers intense, focused doses of light to specific areas of the skin to clear lesions without harming surrounding tissues. Here are some different kinds of light therapy. UVB phototherapy - penetrates the skin to slow the growth of affected cells   - is given at home or at the doctors office   - may be combined with topical treatments or injected or oral medicines to increase effectiveness. penetrates the skin to slow the growth of affected cells is given at home or at the doctors office may be combined with topical treatments or injected or oral medicines to increase effectiveness.

			<Question qid="0000059-5" qtype="treatment">What are the treatments for Psoriasis ?</Question>
			<Answer>While many psoriasis treatments are applied directly to the skin, your doctor may prescribe others that must be taken by mouth or injected. There are also some natural treatments, taken by mouth or applied to the skin, that you can try on your own. Systemic Therapies These therapies, prescribed by your doctor, work in different ways to help control the underlying disease process. It is important to learn as much as you can about these medications and to take them exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Oral or injected medications for psoriasis include the following. - is used to treat severe psoriasis (meaning more than 20 percent of skin is affected)  - slows the rapid growth of skin cells  - is taken by mouth or injected.  is used to treat severe psoriasis (meaning more than 20 percent of skin is affected) slows the rapid growth of skin cells is taken by mouth or injected. - may be used for severe psoriasis not controlled by methotrexate  - suppresses overactive T cells that play a role in psoriasis  - is taken by mouth or injected. may be used for severe psoriasis not controlled by methotrexate suppresses overactive T cells that play a role in psoriasis is taken by mouth or injected. - are man-made drugs related to vitamin A   - help slow the production of skin cells  - reduce inflammation. are man-made drugs related to vitamin A help slow the production of skin cells reduce inflammation. - are made from living cells grown in a laboratory  - block the action of specific cells and proteins that play a role in psoriasis  - must be injected beneath the skin or given intravenously (by IV). are made from living cells grown in a laboratory block the action of specific cells and proteins that play a role in psoriasis must be injected beneath the skin or given intravenously (by IV). Natural Treatments For many people, natural treatments can help relieve the symptoms of psoriasis. There are many natural treatments you can try on your own, but you should never use them to replace the treatment your doctor prescribes. Here are some natural treatments you may want to try. Spending a few minutes in the summer sun can help your psoriasis, but be sure to use sun block and increase time spent in the sun gradually. Applying cream from the aloe vera plant improves symptoms for some people. You should avoid aloe vera tablets. Taking fish oil orally helps some people with psoriasis. If you want to try fish oil, first speak with your doctor, as it may interact with other medications you are taking. Soaking in a solution of Dead Sea salts may improve scaling and itching. Be sure to apply moisturizer when you get out of the tub. Capsaicin, the ingredient that makes cayenne peppers hot, is the active ingredient in some topical pain-relievers. Some people find they relieve pain and itching.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000059-7" qtype="research">what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Psoriasis ?</Question>
			<Answer>Scientists who are working to better understand and treat psoriasis are making headway in several different areas. The Role of T Cells Scientists believe that psoriasis occurs when white blood cells called T cells, which normally help fight infections, attack the bodys skin cells by mistake. Scientists are working to understand what causes these cells to go awry in people with psoriasis. Their hope is that by better understanding why T cells attack the bodys healthy skin tissue, they can develop better treatments to stop or prevent that damaging process. New Treatments Since discovering that T cells attack skin cells in psoriasis, researchers have been studying new treatments that quiet immune system reactions in the skin. Among these are treatments that block the activity of T cells or block cytokines (proteins that promote inflammation). If researchers find a way to target only the disease-causing immune reactions while leaving the rest of the immune system alone, resulting treatments could benefit psoriasis patients as well as those with other autoimmune diseases (when the immune system attacks the bodys own tissues). Currently there are a number of potential psoriasis treatments in clinical trials, including injections, pills, and topical ointments. Clinical trials are research studies with volunteers in which drugs are tested for the effectiveness and safety. All drugs must complete and pass this process before they can be approved by the FDA. Psoriasis Genes Because psoriasis is more common among people who have one or more family members with the disease, scientists have long suspected that genes are involved. A number of genetic loci  specific locations on the genes  have been associated with the development of psoriasis or the severity or progression of the disease. In 2012, scientists discovered the first gene to be directly linked to development of plaque psoriasis. Researchers continue to study the genetic aspects of psoriasis, and some studies are looking at the nervous system to determine the genes responsible for the circuitry that causes itching. Psoriasis-related Conditions Research in recent years has shown that people with psoriasis are more likely to develop other health problems, including problems with the heart and blood vessels. Research is continuing to examine links between psoriasis and other health problems. Scientists are working to understand how and why these diseases occur in people with psoriasis, with the hope that this understanding will lead to better treatments for both psoriasis and the related diseases. Stress Reduction Treatment For many people with psoriasis, life stresses cause the disease to worsen or become more active. Research suggests that stress is associated with the increased production of chemicals by the immune system that promote inflammation. The same chemicals may play a role in the anxiety and depression that is common in people with psoriasis. Researchers are studying the use of stress reduction techniques, along with medical treatment, in the hope that reducing stress will both lower anxiety and improve the skin lesions of psoriasis.
