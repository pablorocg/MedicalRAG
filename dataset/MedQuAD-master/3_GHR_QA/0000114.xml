			<Question qid="0000114-1" qtype="information">What is (are) Behet disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Behet disease is an inflammatory condition that affects many parts of the body. The health problems associated with Behet disease result from widespread inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis). This inflammation most commonly affects the mouth, genitals, skin, and eyes.  Painful mouth sores called aphthous ulcers are usually the first sign of Behet disease. These sores occur on the lips and tongue and inside the cheeks. The ulcers look like common canker sores, and they typically heal within one to two weeks. About 75 percent of all people with Behet disease develop similar ulcers on the genitals. These ulcers occur most frequently on the scrotum in men and on the labia in women.  Behet disease can also cause painful bumps and sores on the skin. Most affected individuals develop pus-filled bumps that resemble acne. These bumps can occur anywhere on the body. Some affected people also have red, tender nodules called erythema nodosum. These nodules usually develop on the legs but can also occur on the face, neck, and arms.  An inflammation of the eye called uveitis is found in more than half of people with Behet disease. Eye problems are more common in younger people with the disease and affect men more often than women. Uveitis can result in blurry vision and an extreme sensitivity to light (photophobia). Rarely, inflammation can also cause eye pain and redness. If untreated, the eye problems associated with Behet disease can lead to blindness.  Less commonly, Behet disease can affect the joints, gastrointestinal tract, large blood vessels, and brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Central nervous system abnormalities are among the most serious complications of Behet disease. Related symptoms can include headaches, confusion, personality changes, memory loss, impaired speech, and problems with balance and movement.  The signs and symptoms of Behet disease usually begin in a person&apos;s twenties or thirties, although they can appear at any age. Some affected people have relatively mild symptoms that are limited to sores in the mouth and on the genitals. Others have more severe symptoms affecting many parts of the body, including the central nervous system. The features of Behet disease typically come and go over a period of months or years. In most affected individuals, the health problems associated with this disorder improve with age.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000114-2" qtype="frequency">How many people are affected by Behet disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>Behet disease is most common in Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, Japan, and other parts of Asia. However, it has been found in populations worldwide.  The highest prevalence of Behet disease has been reported in Turkey, where the disorder affects up to 420 in 100,000 people. The disorder is much less common in northern European countries and the United States, where it generally affects fewer than 1 in 100,000 people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000114-3" qtype="genetic changes">What are the genetic changes related to Behet disease ?</Question>
			<Answer>The cause of Behet disease is unknown. The condition probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, most of which have not been identified. However, a particular variation in the HLA-B gene has been strongly associated with the risk of developing Behet disease.  The HLA-B gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the immune system. The HLA-B gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body&apos;s own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). The HLA-B gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person&apos;s immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. A variation of the HLA-B gene called HLA-B51 increases the risk of developing Behet disease. Although many people with Behet disease have the HLA-B51 variation, most people with this version of the HLA-B gene never develop the disorder. It is unknown how HLA-B51 increases the risk of developing Behet disease.  Researchers have considered many other genetic and environmental factors as possible contributors to Behet disease. Studies have examined several genes related to immune system function, although no gene except HLA-B has been definitively associated with an increased risk of Behet disease. It appears likely that environmental factors, such as certain bacterial or viral infections, play a role in triggering the disease in people who are at risk. However, the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the development of this complex disorder remains unclear.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000114-4" qtype="inheritance">Is Behet disease inherited ?</Question>
			<Answer>Most cases of Behet disease are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A small percentage of all cases have been reported to run in families; however, the condition does not have a clear pattern of inheritance.</Answer>
