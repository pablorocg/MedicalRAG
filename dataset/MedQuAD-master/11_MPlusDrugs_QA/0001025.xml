			<Question qid="0001025-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Progestin-Only Oral Contraceptives and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Progestin-only (norethindrone) oral contraceptives are used to prevent pregnancy. Progestin is a female hormone. It works by preventing the release of eggs from the ovaries (ovulation) and changing the cervical mucus and the lining of the uterus. Progestin-only (norethindrone) oral contraceptives are a very effective method of birth control, but they do not prevent the spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.</Answer>

Your doctor will tell you when you should start taking your progestin-only (norethindrone) oral contraceptive.  Tell your doctor if you are switching from another type of contraception (other birth control pills, vaginal ring, transdermal patch, implant, injection, intrauterine device [IUD]). If you vomit soon after taking a progestin-only (norethindrone) oral contraceptives, you may have to use a backup method of birth control for the next 48 hours. Talk to your doctor about this before you begin to take your oral contraceptive so that you can prepare a backup method of birth control in case it is needed.

			<Question qid="0001025-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Progestin-Only Oral Contraceptives ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001025-10" qtype="other information">What other information should I know about Progestin-Only Oral Contraceptives ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep all appointments with your doctor. Before you have any laboratory tests, tell the laboratory personnel that you take progestin-only (norethindrone)  oral contraceptives, as this medication may interfere with some laboratory tests. Rarely, women can become pregnant even if they are taking oral contraceptives. You should get a pregnancy test if it has been more than 45 days since your last period or if your period is late and you missed one or more doses or took them late and had sex without a backup method of birth control. If you want to become pregnant, stop taking progestin-only (norethindrone)  contraceptives. Progestin-only (norethindrone) contraceptives should not delay your ability to get pregnant. Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.</Answer>
