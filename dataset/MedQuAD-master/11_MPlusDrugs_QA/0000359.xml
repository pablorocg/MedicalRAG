			<Question qid="0000359-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Diclofenac Topical (actinic keratosis) and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Diclofenac topical gel (Solaraze) is used to treat actinic keratosis (flat, scaly growths on the skin caused by too much sun exposure). Diclofenac is in a class of medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The way diclofenac gel works to treat actinic keratosis is not known. Diclofenac is also available as a liquid (Pennsaid) and a gel (Voltaren) that are applied to the skin to treat arthritis pain. This monograph only gives information about diclofenac gel (Solaraze) for actinic keratosis. If you are using either of the products for osteoarthritis, read the monograph entitled diclofenac topical (osteoarthritis pain).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000359-2" qtype="usage">How should Diclofenac Topical (actinic keratosis) be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Topical diclofenac for actinic keratosis comes as a gel (Solaraze) to apply to the skin. It is applied to the affected area two times a day for 60 to 90 days. Apply diclofenac gel at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use diclofenac gel exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply diclofenac gel to open skin wounds, burns, infections, or red, scaly, or peeling skin. Diclofenac gel is only for use on the skin. Be careful not to get the medication in your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you do get the medication in your eyes, nose, or mouth, wash with plenty of water or saline. If your eye(s), nose, or mouth are still irritated after one hour, call your doctor. Wash your hands before applying diclofenac gel. Then use your fingers to gently smooth the gel onto each affected area. Use enough gel to cover the areas completely. When you are finished applying the gel, wash your hands again. Be careful not to touch your eyes or nose before you wash your hands. Your condition may begin to improve after 30 days of treatment, but it may take up to 30 days after the end of treatment before you see complete healing of the affected area or the full benefit of diclofenac gel. Continue to use diclofenac gel even if your condition has begun to improve. Do not stop using the medication without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000359-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Diclofenac Topical (actinic keratosis) ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat, and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not allow diclofenac gel to freeze. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
