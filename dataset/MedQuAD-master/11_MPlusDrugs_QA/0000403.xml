			<Question qid="0000403-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Doxylamine and Pyridoxine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine is used to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnant women whose symptoms have not improved after changing their diet or using other non-medicine treatments. Doxylamine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances in the body that may contribute to nausea and vomiting. Pyridoxine (vitamin B 6 ) is a vitamin. It is given because a lack of pyridoxine in the body may also be a factor in causing nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000403-2" qtype="usage">How should Doxylamine and Pyridoxine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine comes as a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to delay when the medication will start working) tablet and as an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) with a full glass of water. At first, your doctor will usually tell you to take it once a day at bedtime. If your symptoms of nausea and vomiting are not better, then your doctor may tell you to take the delayed-release tablet  two or three times a day, or the extended-release tablet two times a day.  . Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take doxylamine and pyridoxine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the extended-release and delayed-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000403-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Doxylamine and Pyridoxine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).  If your medication came with a desiccant canister (small canister that contains a substance that absorbs moisture to keep the medication dry), leave the canister in the bottle. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
