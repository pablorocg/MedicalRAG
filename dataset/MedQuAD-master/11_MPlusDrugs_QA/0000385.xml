			<Answer>Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease or have ever been treated with cisplatin (Platinol) or carboplatin (Paraplatin) for lung cancer. You may have a higher risk of developing certain serious side effects such as low levels of certain types of blood cells, severe mouth sores, severe skin reactions, and death. Docetaxel injection may cause low levels of white blood cells in the blood.

Your doctor may also recommend that you check your temperature frequently during your treatment. Follow these instructions carefully. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: fever, chills, sore throat, or other signs of infection. Docetaxel injection may cause severe allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you are allergic to docetaxel injection or drugs made with polysorbate 80, an ingredient found in some medications. Ask your doctor if you are unsure if a medication you are allergic to contains polysorbate 80. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: rash, hives, itching, warm sensation, chest tightness, fainting, dizziness, nausea or difficulty breathing or swallowing. Docetaxel injection may cause serious or life-threatening fluid retention (condition where the body keeps excess fluid). Fluid retention does not usually start immediately, and most commonly occurs around the fifth dosing cycle.

			<Question qid="0000385-3" qtype="usage">How should Docetaxel Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Docetaxel injection comes as a liquid to be given intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a hospital or clinic. It is usually given over 1 hour once every 3 weeks. Your doctor will probably prescribe a steroid medication such as dexamethasone for you to take during each dosing cycle to help prevent certain side effects. Be sure to follow the directions carefully and take this medication exactly as prescribed. If you forget to take your medication or do not take it on schedule, be sure to tell your doctor before receiving your docetaxel injection. Because certain docetaxel injection preparations contains alcohol, you may experience certain symptoms during or for 1&#8211;2 hours after your infusion. If you experience any of these symptoms, tell your doctor right away: confusion, stumbling, becoming very sleepy, or feeling like you are drunk. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>
