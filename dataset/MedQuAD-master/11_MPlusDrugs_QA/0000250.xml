			<Question qid="0000250-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Cilostazol and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cilostazol is used to reduce the symptoms of intermittent claudication (pain in the legs that worsens when walking and improves when resting that is caused by narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood to the legs).

			<Question qid="0000250-3" qtype="usage">How should Cilostazol be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cilostazol comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day, at least 30 minutes before or 2 hours after breakfast and dinner. Take cilostazol at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on the prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cilostazol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Cilostazol controls the symptoms of intermittent claudication but does not cure it. Although you may notice improvements in 2 to 4 weeks, it may take up to 12 weeks before you notice the full benefit (increased walking distance) of cilostazol. Continue taking cilostazol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking cilostazol without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000250-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Cilostazol ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
