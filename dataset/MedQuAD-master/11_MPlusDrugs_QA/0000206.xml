			<Question qid="0000206-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Cefadroxil and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cefadroxil is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria such as infections of the skin, throat, tonsils, and urinary tract. Cefadroxil is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as cefadroxil will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000206-2" qtype="usage">How should Cefadroxil be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cefadroxil comes as a capsule, tablet, and suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food every 12 or 24 hours . Take cefadroxil at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cefadroxil exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Take cefadroxil with food to reduce nausea and stomach upset. Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with cefadroxil. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Continue to take cefadroxil until you finish the prescription even if you feel better. If you stop taking cefadroxil too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000206-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Cefadroxil ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store the capsules and tablets at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Keep liquid medicine in the refrigerator, tightly closed, and dispose of any unused medication after 14 days. . . Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000206-9" qtype="other information">What other information should I know about Cefadroxil ?</Question>
