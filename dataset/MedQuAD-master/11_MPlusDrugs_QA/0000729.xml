			<Question qid="0000729-2" qtype="usage">How should Luliconazole Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Luliconazole comes as a cream to apply to the skin. To treat jock itch and ringworm, luliconazole is usually applied once a day for 1 week. To treat athlete's foot, luliconazole is usually applied once a day for 2 weeks. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use luliconazole exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. To use the cream, apply enough cream to cover the affected area and about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of the skin around it. You should wash your hands after applying the medication. Your symptoms should improve at the beginning of your treatment. Continue to use luliconazole cream even if you are feeling well. If you stop using luliconazole cream too soon, your infection may not be completely cured and your symptoms may return. Luliconazole cream is for external use only. Do not let luliconazole get into your eyes, nose, or mouth, and do not swallow it. Do not use luliconazole cream in the vaginal area. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000729-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Luliconazole Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
