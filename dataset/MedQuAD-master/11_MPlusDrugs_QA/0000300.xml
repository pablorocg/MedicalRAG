			<Question qid="0000300-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Cyclopentolate Ophthalmic and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cyclopentolate ophthalmic is used to cause mydriasis (pupil dilation) and cycloplegia (paralysis of the ciliary muscle of the eye) before an eye examination. Cyclopentolate is in a class of medications called mydriatics. Cyclopentolate works by blocking certain receptors found in the eye to temporarily relax or provide short-term paralysis of the eye muscles.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000300-2" qtype="usage">How should Cyclopentolate Ophthalmic be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cyclopentolate comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eye. Your healthcare provider will instill the solution into the eye(s) prior to an eye examination. Cyclopentolate ophthalmic may take about a half an hour or more to fully work after instillation. Effects generally may last for up to 24 hours, but may last several days in some people. People with dark eye colors may require increased cyclopentolate doses. If cyclopentolate is given to a child, watch them closely for at least 30 minutes after instillation. Infants should not be fed for 4 hours after cyclopentolate instillation. Cyclopentolate ophthalmic is for use only in the eye(s). Do not swallow cyclopentolate solution. Be careful not to let the tip of the bottle touch your eye, fingers, face, or any surface. If the tip does touch another surface, bacteria may get into the eye drops. To instill the eye drops, follow these steps:
 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water., While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket., Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it., Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face., While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that the drop(s) fall into the pocket made by the lower eyelid., Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid., Close your eye and tip your head down as though looking at the floor., Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure for 2 to 3 minutes., If you require a second dose in the same eye, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before instilling the next drop(s) and repeat steps 1 to 8., Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle., Wash your hands and if necessary your child's hands after instillation to remove any medication., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000300-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Cyclopentolate Ophthalmic ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
