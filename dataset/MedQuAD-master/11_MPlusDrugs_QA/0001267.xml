			<Question qid="0001267-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Ustekinumab Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ustekinumab injection is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (skin disease in which red, scaly patches form on some areas of the body) in adults and children 6 years or older who may benefit from medications or phototherapy (a treatment that involves exposing the skin to ultraviolet light). It is also used alone or in combination with methotrexate (Otrexup, Rasuvo, Trexall) to treat psoriatic arthritis (a condition that causes joint pain and swelling and scales on the skin) in adults. Ustekinumab injection is also used to treat Crohn's disease (a condition in which the body attacks the lining of the digestive tract, causing pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever) in adults. Ustekinumab injection is also used to treat ulcerative colitis (a condition which causes swelling and sores in the lining of the colon [large intestine] and rectum) in adults. Ustekinumab injection is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by stopping the action of certain cells in the body that cause the symptoms of plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001267-2" qtype="usage">How should Ustekinumab Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ustekinumab comes as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (under the skin) or intravenously (into a vein). For the treatment of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, it is usually injected subcutaneously every 4 weeks for the first two doses and then every 12 weeks for as long as treatment continues. For the treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, it is usually injected intravenously for the first dose and then given subcutaneously every 8 weeks for as long as treatment continues. You will receive your first subcutaneous dose of ustekinumab injection in your doctor's office. After that, your doctor may continue to give you injections or allow you to inject ustekinumab injection yourself or have a caregiver perform the injections. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you or the person who will be performing the injections how to inject ustekinumab. Before you use ustekinumab injection yourself the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. If your medication comes in a prefilled syringe or vial, use each syringe or vial only once and inject all the solution in the syringe. Even if there is still some solution left in the syringe or device, do not use it again. Dispose of used needles, syringes, and devices in a puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container. Do not shake a prefilled syringe or vial that contains ustekinumab. Always look at ustekinumab solution before injecting it. Check that the expiration date has not passed and that the liquid is clear or slightly yellow. The liquid may contain a few visible white particles. Do not use the vial or prefilled syringe if it is damaged, expired, frozen, or if the liquid is cloudy or contains large particles. You can inject ustekinumab injection subcutaneously anywhere on the front of your thighs (upper leg), upper outer arms, buttocks, or abdomen (stomach) except your navel and the area 2 inches (5 centimeters) around it. To reduce the chances of soreness or redness, use a different site for each injection. Do not inject into an area where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard or where you have scars or stretch marks. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with ustekinumab injection. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>
