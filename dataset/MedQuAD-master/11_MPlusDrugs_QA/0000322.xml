			<Question qid="0000322-2" qtype="usage">How should Daratumumab Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Daratumumab comes as a liquid (solution) that is given intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a healthcare setting. Your doctor will decide how often you are to receive daratumumab based on other medications that may be given and your body's response to this medication. A doctor or nurse will watch you closely while you are receiving the infusion and afterwards to be sure you are not having a serious reaction to the medication. You will be given other medications to help prevent and treat reactions to daratumumab prior to your infusion and for the first and second days after you receive your medication. Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms: cough, wheezing, throat tightness and irritation, itchy, runny, or stuffy nose, headache, itching, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, rash, hives, dizziness, lightheadedness, difficulty breathing, chest discomfort, or shortness of breath. Your doctor may decrease your dose of daratumumab or temporarily or permanently stop your treatment. This depends on how well the medication works for you and the side effects you experience. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with daratumumab. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>
