			<Question qid="0000190-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Canagliflozin and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Canagliflozin is used along with diet and exercise, and sometimes with other medications, to lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally). Canagliflozin is also used to reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack, or death in people who have type 2 diabetes along with heart and blood vessel disease. Canagliflozin is also used to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, worsening of kidney function, needing to be hospitalized for heart failure, and cardiovascular death in people who have type 2 diabetes along with severe kidney disease. Canagliflozin is in a class of medications called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. It lowers blood sugar by causing the kidneys to get rid of more glucose in the urine. Canagliflozin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000190-2" qtype="usage">How should Canagliflozin be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Canagliflozin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day before breakfast or the first main meal of the day. Take canagliflozin at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take canagliflozin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of canagliflozin and gradually increase your dose. Canagliflozin controls type 2 diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to take canagliflozin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking canagliflozin without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000190-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Canagliflozin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000190-10" qtype="other information">What other information should I know about Canagliflozin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order a lab test before and during your treatment with canagliflozin to check how well your kidneys are working. Your blood sugar levels should be checked regularly to determine your response to canagliflozin. Your doctor will order other lab tests, including glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), to check your response to canagliflozin. Your doctor will also tell you how to check your response to this medication by measuring your blood sugar levels at home. Follow these instructions carefully. Before having any laboratory test, tell your doctor and the laboratory personnel that you are taking canagliflozin. Because of the way this medication works, your urine may test positive for glucose. You should always wear a diabetic identification bracelet to be sure you get proper treatment in an emergency. Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.</Answer>
