			<Question qid="0001089-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Rotigotine Transdermal Patch and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rotigotine transdermal patches are used to treat the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD; a disorder of the nervous system that causes difficulties with movement, muscle control, and balance) including shaking of parts of the body, stiffness, slowed movements, and problems with balance. Rotigotine transdermal patches are also used to treat restless legs syndrome (RLS or Ekbom syndrome; a condition that causes discomfort in the legs and a strong urge to move the legs, especially at night and when sitting or lying down). Rotigotine is in a class of medications called dopamine agonists. It works by acting in place of dopamine, a natural substance produced in the brain that is needed to control movement.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001089-2" qtype="usage">How should Rotigotine Transdermal Patch be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Transdermal rotigotine comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is usually applied once a day. Apply the rotigotine patch at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use rotigotine exactly as directed. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of rotigotine and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once a week. Rotigotine controls the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome but does not cure them. It may take several weeks before you feel the full benefit of rotigotine. Continue to use rotigotine patches even if you feel well. Do not stop using rotigotine transdermal patches without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using rotigotine patches, you may experience fever, confusion, muscle stiffness, a lack of interest or concern for usual activities or things you usually care about, anxiety, depression, tiredness, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, sweating, or pain. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. Apply the patch to an area on the stomach, thigh, hip, flank (side of the body between the ribs and pelvis), shoulder, or upper arm. The area of skin should be clean, dry and healthy. Do not apply the patch to skin that is oily, red, irritated, or injured. Do not use creams, lotions, ointments, oils, or powders on the area of skin where the patch will be placed. Do not apply the patch to skin folds and areas of skin that could be under a waistband or rubbed by tight clothing. If the patch is to be applied to a hairy area, shave the area at least 3 days before applying the patch. Select a different area of skin each day such as changing from the right side to the left side or by moving from the upper body to the lower body. Do not apply the rotigotine patch to the same area of skin more often than once every 14 days. While you are wearing the patch, keep the area away from other sources of heat such as heating pads, electric blankets and heated waterbeds; or direct sunlight. Do not take a hot bath or use a sauna. Be careful to not dislodge the patch during bathing or physical activity. If the edges of the patch lift, use a bandage tape to re-secure it to the skin. If the patch falls off, apply a new patch to a different place on your skin for the rest of the day. The following day, remove that patch and apply a new patch at the usual time. If the area of skin that was covered by the patch becomes irritated or develops a rash, do not expose this area to direct sunlight until the skin heals. Exposure of this area to sun could cause changes in your skin color. Do not cut or damage a rotigotine patch. To apply the patch, follow these steps:
 Hold the two sides of the pouch and pull apart., Remove patch from the pouch. Apply the patch right away after removing it from the protective pouch., Hold the patch with both hands, with the protective liner on top., Bend the edges of the patch away from you so that the S-shaped cut in the liner opens., Peel off one half of the protective liner. Do not touch the sticky surface because the medicine could come off on your fingers., Apply the sticky half of the patch to a clean area of skin and remove the remaining liner., Press the patch firmly with the palm of your hand for 30 seconds. Go around the edges with your fingers to press them onto the skin. Make sure that the patch is flat against the skin (there should be no bumps or folds in the patch)., After applying the new patch, be sure to remove the patch from the previous day. Use your fingers to peel it off slowly. Fold the patch in half with and press firmly to seal it shut. Dispose of it safely, so that it is out of the reach of children and pets., If there is any adhesive left on the skin, gently wash the area with warm water and mild soap or gently rub the area with baby or mineral oil to remove it., Wash your hands with soap and water. Do not touch your eyes or any objects until you have washed your hands., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001089-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Rotigotine Transdermal Patch ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the original pouch it came in, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
