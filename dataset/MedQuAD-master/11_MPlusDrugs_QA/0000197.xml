			<Answer>Carboplatin injection must be given in a hospital or medical facility under the supervision of a doctor who is experienced in giving chemotherapy medications for cancer. Carboplatin can cause a severe decrease in the number of blood cells in your bone marrow. This increases the risk that you will develop a serious infection or bleeding. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: fever, sore throat, chills, ongoing cough and congestion, or other signs of infection; unusual bleeding or bruising; black and tarry stools; red blood in stools; bloody vomit; vomited material that looks like coffee grounds. Carboplatin may cause severe allergic reactions. If you experience an allergic reaction to carboplatin injection, it may begin within a few minutes after your infusion starts, and you may experience the following symptoms: hives; skin rash; itching; reddening of the skin; difficulty breathing or swallowing; dizziness; faintness; or fast heartbeat. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests before, during, and after your treatment to check your body's response to carboplatin. Your doctor may need to stop or delay your treatment if you experience certain side effects.</Answer>
