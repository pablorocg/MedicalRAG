			<Question qid="0000295-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Cromolyn Oral Inhalation and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cromolyn oral inhalation is used to prevent the wheezing, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, coughing, and chest tightness caused by asthma. It also is used to prevent breathing difficulties (bronchospasm) caused by exercise, cold and dry air, or by inhaling substances such as pet dander, pollen, dust mites, or chemicals, such as perfume. It works by preventing the release of substances that cause inflammation (swelling) in the air passages of the lungs.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000295-2" qtype="usage">How should Cromolyn Oral Inhalation be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cromolyn oral inhalation comes as a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a special nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). When the nebulizer is used to prevent symptoms of asthma, it is usually used 4 times a day. When the nebulizer is used to prevent breathing difficulty caused by exercise, cold and dry air, or by inhaling a substance (trigger), it is usually used 10 to 15 minutes before exercise or before you come into contact with the trigger. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use cromolyn exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Cromolyn controls asthma but does not cure it. Your symptoms may improve soon after you begin using cromolyn, but it may take up to 4 weeks for before you feel the full benefit of the medication. You should use it regularly for it to be effective. If your symptoms have not improved after 4 weeks, tell your doctor. Continue to use cromolyn even if you feel well. Do not stop using cromolyn without talking to your doctor. Cromolyn oral inhalation helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks. Before you use cromolyn inhalation for the first time, read the written instructions that come with the nebulizer. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it. Practice using the nebulizer while he or she watches. To inhale the solution using a nebulizer, follow these steps;

Sit in an upright, comfortable position and turn on the compressor., Breathe in calmly, deeply, and evenly for about 5 to 10 minutes until mist stops forming in the nebulizer chamber., Clean your nebulizer regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your nebulizer., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000295-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Cromolyn Oral Inhalation ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Keep unused vials of nebulizer solution in the foil pouch until you are ready to use them. Store nebulizer vials at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
