			<Question qid="0000929-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Palbociclib and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Palbociclib is used in combination with another medication as an initial treatment for a certain type of hormone receptor&#8211;positive, advanced breast cancer (breast cancer that depends on hormones such as estrogen to grow) that has spread to other parts of the body. Palbociclib is also used along with fulvestrant (Faslodex) to treat a certain type of hormone receptor&#8211;positive, advanced breast cancer (breast cancer that depends on hormones such as estrogen to grow) that has spread to other parts of the body in people who have been treated successfully with an antiestrogen medication such as tamoxifen (Soltamox). Palbociclib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop or slow the spread of cancer cells.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000929-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Palbociclib ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
