			<Question qid="0000331-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Deferiprone ?</Question>
			<Answer>Deferiprone may cause a decrease in the number of white blood cells made by your bone marrow. White blood cells help your body fight infection, so if you have a low number of white blood cells, there is a higher risk that you will develop a serious or life-threatening infection. Tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, because taking certain other medications along with deferiprone may increase the risk that your white blood cell count will decrease. If you experience any of the following symptoms of infection, stop taking deferiprone and call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical help: fever, sore throat, mouth sores, flu-like symptoms, chills, or severe shaking. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain laboratory tests, including tests to check your white blood cell count before your treatment and at least once weekly during your treatment. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with deferiprone and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide. Talk to your doctor about the risk(s) of taking deferiprone.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000331-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Deferiprone and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Deferiprone is used to remove excess iron in the body in adults and children 3 years of age and older who have thalassemia (an inherited condition that causes a low number of red blood cells). It is also used to remove excess iron in adults and children 3 years of age and older with sickle cell disease (an inherited blood disease) or other types of anemia (a lower than normal number of red blood cells). Deferiprone is in a class of medications called iron chelators. It works by attaching to iron in the body so that it can be excreted (removed from the body).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000331-3" qtype="usage">How should Deferiprone be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Deferiprone comes as a tablet and as an oral solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken two or three times daily. Deferiprone may be taken with or without food, but taking it with meals may help to prevent nausea and vomiting that may be caused by the medication. Take deferiprone at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take deferiprone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If your dose includes half of a tablet, split a tablet carefully on the score mark. Use the measuring cup provided with the solution to measure your dose. Add your dose to the provided measuring cup and drink it. Then, add 2 to 3 teaspoons (10 to 15 mL) of water to the measuring cup, gently swirl it around to mix the water with any remaining medication in the cup, and drink the mixture. Hand wash the measuring cup with water after use. Your doctor may adjust your dose of deferiprone every 2 to 3 months depending on your laboratory test results.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000331-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Deferiprone ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). After first opening the oral solution bottle, discard it and any unused oral solution after 35 days. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
