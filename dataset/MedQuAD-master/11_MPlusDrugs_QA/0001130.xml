			<Question qid="0001130-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Sorafenib and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Sorafenib is used to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC; a type of cancer that begins in the kidneys). Sorafenib is also used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (a type of liver cancer) that cannot be treated with surgery and a certain type of thyroid cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and cannot be treated with radioactive iodine. Sorafenib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop the spread of cancer cells.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001130-2" qtype="usage">How should Sorafenib be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Sorafenib comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day. Sorafenib is taken without food, 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.

Take sorafenib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole with water. Do not split, chew, or crush them. Your doctor may decrease your dose of sorafenib during your treatment, or may tell you to temporarily or permanently stop taking sorafenib for a period of time if you experience side effects. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with sorafenib. Continue to take sorafenib even if you feel well. Do not stop taking sorafenib without talking to your doctor. Sorafenib is not available in pharmacies. You can only get sorafenib through the mail from a specialty pharmacy. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about receiving your medication.

			<Question qid="0001130-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Sorafenib ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
