			<Question qid="0001023-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Prochlorperazine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Studies have shown that older adults with dementia (a brain disorder that affects the ability to remember, think clearly, communicate, and perform daily activities and that may cause changes in mood and personality) who take antipsychotics (medications for mental illness) such as prochlorperazine have an increased chance of death during treatment. Prochlorperazine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of behavior problems in older adults with dementia. Talk to the doctor who prescribed this medication if you, a family member, or someone you care for has dementia and is taking prochlorperazine.

			<Question qid="0001023-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Prochlorperazine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Prochlorperazine suppositories and tablets are used to control severe nausea and vomiting. Prochlorperazine tablets are also used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia (a mental illness that causes disturbed or unusual thinking, loss of interest in life, and strong or inappropriate emotions). Prochlorperazine tablets are also used on a short-term basis to treat anxiety that could not be controlled by other medications. Prochlorperazine should not be used to treat any condition in children who are younger than 2 years old or who weigh less than 20 pounds (about 9 kilograms). Prochlorperazine is in a class of medications called conventional antipsychotics. It works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001023-3" qtype="usage">How should Prochlorperazine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Prochlorperazine comes as a tablet to take by mouth and as a suppository to place in the rectum. Prochlorperazine tablets are usually taken three to four times a day by adults and are usually given to children one to three times a day. Prochlorperazine suppositories are usually inserted twice a day. Use prochlorperazine at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use prochlorperazine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of prochlorperazine and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 2-3 days. If you are using prochlorperazine to treat schizophrenia, prochlorperazine may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to use prochlorperazine even if you feel well. Do not stop using prochlorperazine without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using prochlorperazine, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and shakiness. To insert a prochlorperazine suppository, follow these steps:
 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water., If the suppository is soft, hold it under cool water or place it in the refrigerator for a few minutes to harden it before removing the wrapper., Remove the wrapper, if present., If you were told to use half of the suppository, cut it lengthwise with a clean, sharp blade., Put on a finger cot or disposable glove, if desired (available at a pharmacy)., Lubricate the suppository tip with a water-soluble lubricant such as K-Y Jelly, not petroleum jelly (Vaseline). If you do not have this lubricant, moisten your rectal area with cool tap water., Lie on your side with your lower leg straightened out and your upper leg bent forward toward your stomach., Lift upper buttock to expose the rectal area., Insert the suppository, pointed end first, with your finger until it passes the muscular sphincter of the rectum, about 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 centimeters) in infants and 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in adults. If not inserted past this sphincter, the suppository may pop out., Hold buttocks together for a few seconds., Remain lying down for about 15 minutes to avoid having the suppository come out., Try to avoid having a bowel movement for about an hour so that the medication in the suppository can be absorbed into the body., Discard used materials and wash your hands thoroughly., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001023-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Prochlorperazine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store prochlorperazine suppositories in their wrappers; do not unwrap a suppository until just before you insert it. Store the medication at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
