			<Question qid="0001203-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Thyroid ?</Question>
			<Answer>Thyroid hormone should not be used to speed weight loss in people who are overweight but do not have a thyroid condition. Thyroid hormone will not help speed weight loss in people with normal thyroid glands, and it may cause serious or life-threatening side effects in these people. The risk of serious side effects is even higher if thyroid is also taken with amphetamines such as benzphetamine(Didrex), dextroamphetamine([Dexedrine, in Adderall), and methamphetamine (Desoxyn). Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking this medication.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001203-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Thyroid and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Thyroid is used to treat the symptoms of hypothyroidism (a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone). Symptoms of hypothyroidism include lack of energy, depression, constipation, weight gain, hair loss, dry skin, dry coarse hair, muscle cramps, decreased concentration, aches and pains, swelling of the legs, and increased sensitivity to cold. Thyroid is also used to treat goiter (enlarged thyroid gland). Thyroid is in a class of medications called thyroid agents. It works by supplying the thyroid hormone normally produced by the body.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001203-3" qtype="usage">How should Thyroid be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Thyroid comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day before breakfast. Take thyroid at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take thyroid exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of thyroid and gradually increase your dose. Thyroid helps control the symptoms of hypothyroidism, but does not cure this condition. It may take up to several weeks before you notice any change in your symptoms. To control the symptoms of hypothyroidism, you probably will need to take thyroid for the rest of your life. Continue to take thyroid even if you feel well. Do not stop taking thyroid without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001203-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Thyroid ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001203-11" qtype="other information">What other information should I know about Thyroid ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your response to thyroid. Before having any laboratory test, tell your doctor and the laboratory personnel that you are taking thyroid. Thyroid tablets may have a strong odor. This does not mean that the medication is spoiled or that it cannot be used. Learn the brand name and generic name of your medication. Check your medication each time you have your prescription refilled or receive a new prescription. Do not switch brands without talking to your doctor or pharmacist, as each brand of thyroid contains a slightly different amount of medication. Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.</Answer>
