When bendamustine injection is used to treat NHL, it is usually injected once a day for 2 days, followed by 19 days when the medication is not given. This treatment cycle may be repeated every 21 days for up to 8 cycles. Your doctor may need to delay your treatment and adjust your dose if you experience certain side effects. Your doctor may also give you other medication(s) to prevent or treat certain side effects. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with bendamustine injection.</Answer>
