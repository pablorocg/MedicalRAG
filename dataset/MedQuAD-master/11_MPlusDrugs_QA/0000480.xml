			<Question qid="0000480-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Famotidine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Prescription famotidine is used to treat ulcers (sores on the lining of the stomach or small intestine); gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD, a condition in which backward flow of acid from the stomach causes heartburn and injury of the esophagus [tube that connects the mouth and stomach]); and conditions where the stomach produces too much acid, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (tumors in the pancreas or small intestine that cause increased production of stomach acid). Over-the-counter famotidine is used to prevent and treat heartburn due to acid indigestion and sour stomach caused by eating or drinking certain foods or drinks. Famotidine is in a class of medications called H 2  blockers. It works by decreasing the amount of acid made in the stomach.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000480-2" qtype="usage">How should Famotidine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Prescription famotidine comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once daily at bedtime or two to four times a day. Over-the-counter famotidine comes as a tablet, a chewable tablet, and a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day. To prevent symptoms, it is taken 15 to 60 minutes before eating foods or drinking drinks that may cause heartburn. Follow the directions on your prescription or the package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take famotidine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often or for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor. Shake the liquid well for 5 to 10 seconds before each use to mix the medicine evenly. Swallow the tablets and capsules with a full glass of water. Thoroughly chew the chewable tablets before swallowing them. Swallow the chewed tablet with a full glass of water. Do not take more than two tablets, capsules, or chewable tablets of over-the-counter famotidine in 24 hours and do not take over-the-counter famotidine for longer than 2 weeks unless your doctor tells you that you should. If symptoms of heartburn, acid indigestion, or sour stomach last longer than 2 weeks, stop taking over-the-counter famotidine and call your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000480-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Famotidine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not allow the liquid to freeze. Dispose of unused famotidine liquid after 30 days. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
