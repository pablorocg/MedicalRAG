			<Question qid="0000405-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Dronedarone ?</Question>
			<Answer>You should not take dronedarone if you have severe heart failure. Dronedarone may increase the risk of death in people who have severe heart failure. Tell your doctor if you have heart failure that is severe enough to cause shortness of breath while you are at rest, after a small amount of exercise, or after any physical activity. Also tell your doctor if you have been hospitalized for heart failure during the past month even if you are feeling better. Your doctor will not prescribe dronedarone for you. You should not take dronedarone if you have atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm disorder that may cause the heartbeat to be fast and irregular) that will not or cannot be converted back to a normal heart rhythm. Dronedarone may increase the risk of death, stroke, and the need to be hospitalized in people with permanent atrial fibrillation. Your doctor will check your heart rhythm at least every 3 months while you are taking dronedarone. Call your doctor immediately if your heartbeat becomes fast or irregular while you are taking dronedarone. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with dronedarone and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000405-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Dronedarone and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dronedarone is used to treat people who currently have normal heart rhythm, but have had atrial fibrillation in the past. Dronedarone decreases the risk that people who have this condition will need to be hospitalized to treat atrial fibrillation. Dronedarone is in a class of medications called antiarrhythmics. It works by helping the heart to beat normally.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000405-3" qtype="usage">How should Dronedarone be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dronedarone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day, with the morning meal and the evening meal. Take dronedarone at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take dronedarone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may prescribe certain medications to decrease the risk of stroke while you are taking dronedarone. Take this medication exactly as directed during your treatment. Dronedarone will help control your heartbeat only as long as you continue to take it. Continue to take dronedarone even if you feel well and have felt well for a long time. Do not stop taking dronedarone without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000405-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Dronedarone ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
