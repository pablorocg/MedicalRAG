			<Question qid="0000559-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Glycopyrrolate and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Glycopyrrolate is used in combination with other medications to treat ulcers in adults and children 12 years of age and older. Glycopyrrolate (Cuvposa) is used to reduce saliva and drooling in children between 3 and16 years of age that have certain medical conditions that cause drooling. Glycopyrrolate is in a class of medications called anticholinergics. It decreases stomach acid and saliva production by blocking the activity of a certain natural substance in the body.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000559-2" qtype="usage">How should Glycopyrrolate be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Glycopyrrolate comes as a tablet and solution (liquid) to take by mouth. For the treatment of ulcers, the tablet is usually taken 2 or 3 times a day. To reduce saliva and drooling in children with certain medical conditions, the solution is usually taken 3 times a day. Take the solution on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take glycopyrrolate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will probably start your child on a low dose of the solution and gradually increase the dose over a 4-week period. If you are giving the solution to a child, do not use a household spoon to measure the dose. Use an oral syringe that is made especially for measuring liquid medication.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000559-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Glycopyrrolate ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
