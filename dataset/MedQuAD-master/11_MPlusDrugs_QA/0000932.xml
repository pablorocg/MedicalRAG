			<Question qid="0000932-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Paliperidone Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Studies have shown that older adults with dementia (a brain disorder that affects the ability to remember, think clearly, communicate, and perform daily activities and that may cause changes in mood and personality) who take antipsychotics (medications for mental illness) such as paliperidone have an increased chance of death during treatment. Older adults with dementia may also have a greater chance of having a stroke or ministroke during treatment. Paliperidone extended-release (long-acting) injection is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of behavior disorders in older adults with dementia. Talk to the doctor who prescribed this medication if you, a family member, or someone you care for has dementia and is being treated with paliperidone extended-release injection. For more information visit the FDA website:  https://www.fda.gov/Drugs . Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving paliperidone extended-release injection.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000932-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Paliperidone Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Paliperidone extended-release injections (Invega Hafyera, Invega Sustenna, Invega Trinza) are used to treat schizophrenia (a mental illness that causes disturbed or unusual thinking, loss of interest in life, and strong or inappropriate emotions). Paliperidone extended-release injection (Invega Sustenna) is also used alone or with other medications to treat schizoaffective disorder (a mental illness that causes both a loss of contact with reality and mood problems [depression or mania]). Paliperidone extended-release injection is in a class of medications called atypical antipsychotics. It works by changing the activity of certain natural substances in the brain.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000932-3" qtype="usage">How should Paliperidone Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Paliperidone extended-release injections come as a suspension (liquid) to be injected into a muscle by a healthcare provider. There are three different types of paliperidone extended release injection products: Invega Sustenna, Invega Trinza, and Invega Hafyera. Your doctor will start you with a single dose of paliperidone extended-release injection (Invega Sustenna). After you receive your first dose, you will receive a second dose usually 1 week after the first and then once every month after that. After at least 4 months of treatment with paliperidone extended-release injection (Invega Sustenna) and you have responded to your treatment, your doctor may switch you to paliperidone extended-release injection (Invega Trinza). Paliperidone extended-release injection (Invega Trinza) is usually injected into a muscle by a healthcare provider once every 3 months. After at least 4 months of treatment with paliperidone extended-release injection (Invega Sustenna)  or  after at least one 3-month injection of paliperidone extended-release injection (Invega Trinza) and you have responded to either treatment, your doctor may switch you to paliperidone extended-release injection (Invega Hafyera). Paliperidone extended-release injection (Invega Hafyera) is usually injected into a muscle by a healthcare provider once every 6 months. Paliperidone extended-release injection may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to keep appointments to receive paliperidone extended-release injection even if you feel well. Talk to your doctor if you do not feel like you are getting better during your treatment with paliperidone extended-release injection. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>
