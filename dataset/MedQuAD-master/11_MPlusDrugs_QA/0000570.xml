			<Question qid="0000570-2" qtype="usage">How should Halcinonide Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Halcinonide comes in an ointment and cream  to apply to the skin. It is usually applied two or three times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use halcinonide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply it to other areas of your body or use it to treat other skin conditions unless directed to do so by your doctor. To use halcinonide topical, apply a small amount of ointment or cream  to cover the affected area of skin with a thin film and rub it in gently. This medication is only for use on the skin. Do not let halcinonide topical get into your eyes or mouth and do not swallow it. Avoid use in the genital or rectal areas, and in skin creases and armpits unless directed by your doctor. If you are using halcinonide on a child's diaper area, do not use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants. Such use may increase side effects. Do not wrap or bandage the treated area unless your doctor tells you that you should. Such use may increase side effects.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000570-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Halcinonide Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
