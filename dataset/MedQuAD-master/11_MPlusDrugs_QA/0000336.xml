			<Question qid="0000336-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Denosumab Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Denosumab injection (Prolia) is used
 to treat osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) in women who have undergone menopause (''change of life;'' end of menstrual periods) who have an increased risk for fractures (broken bones) or who cannot take or did not respond to other medication treatments for osteoporosis., to treat men who have an increased risk for fractures (broken bones) or who cannot take or did not respond to other medication treatments for osteoporosis., treat osteoporosis that is caused by corticosteroid medications in men and women who will be taking corticosteroid medications for at least 6 months and have an increased risk for fractures or who cannot take or did not respond to other medication treatments for osteoporosis., to treat bone loss in men who are being treated for prostate cancer with certain medications that cause bone loss,, to treat bone loss in women with breast cancer who are receiving certain medications that increase their risk for fractures.,  Denosumab injection (Xgeva) is used
Denosumab injection is in a class of medications called RANK ligand inhibitors. It works to prevent bone loss by blocking a certain receptor in the body to decrease bone breakdown. It works to treat GCTB by blocking a certain receptor in the tumor cells which slows the tumor growth. It works to treat high calcium levels by decreasing bone breakdown as the breakdown of bones releases calcium. to reduce the risk of fractures in people who have multiple myeloma (cancer that begins in the plasma cells and causes bone damage), and in people who have certain types of cancer that began in another part of the body but has spread to the bones., in adults and some adolescents to treat giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB; a type of bone tumor) that cannot be treated with surgery., to treat high calcium levels that are caused by cancer in people who did not respond to other medications., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000336-2" qtype="usage">How should Denosumab Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Denosumab injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in your upper arm, upper thigh, or stomach area. It is usually injected by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or clinic. Denosumab injection (Prolia) is usually given once every 6 months. When denosumab injection (Xgeva) is used to reduce the risk of fractures from multiple myeloma, or cancer that has spread to the bones, it is usually given once every 4 weeks. When denosumab injection (Xgeva) is used to treat giant cell tumor of bone, or high calcium levels caused by cancer, it is usually given every 7 days for the first three doses (on day 1, day 8, and day 15) and then once every 4 weeks starting 2 weeks after the first three doses. Your doctor will tell you to take supplements of calcium and vitamin D while you are being treated with denosumab injection. Take these supplements exactly as directed. When denosumab injection (Prolia) is used to treat osteoporosis or bone loss, your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with denosumab injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000336-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Denosumab Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Do not shake denosumab injection. Store it in the refrigerator and protect it from light. Do not freeze. Denosumab injection can be kept at room temperature for up to 14 days. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
