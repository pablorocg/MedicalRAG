			<Question qid="0000573-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Haloperidol Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Studies have shown that older adults with dementia (a brain disorder that affects the ability to remember, think clearly, communicate, and perform daily activities and that may cause changes in mood and personality) who take antipsychotics (medications for mental illness) such as haloperidol have an increased chance of death during treatment. Haloperidol injection and haloperidol extended-release injection are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of behavior disorders in older adults with dementia. Talk to the doctor who prescribed this medication if you, a family member, or someone you care for has dementia and is being treated with haloperidol injection or haloperidol extended-release injection.

			<Question qid="0000573-3" qtype="usage">How should Haloperidol Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Haloperidol injection comes as a solution to be injected into a muscle by a healthcare provider. Haloperidol injection is usually given as needed for agitation, motor tics, or verbal tics. If you still have symptoms after you receive your first dose, you may be given one or more additional doses. Haloperidol extended-release injection comes as a solution to be injected into a muscle by a healthcare provider. Haloperidol extended-release injection is usually given once every 4 weeks. Haloperidol injection and haloperidol extended-release injection may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to keep appointments to receive haloperidol even if you feel well. Talk to your doctor if you do not feel like you are getting better during your treatment with haloperidol injection. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>
