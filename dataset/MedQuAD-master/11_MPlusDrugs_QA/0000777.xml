			<Question qid="0000777-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Methsuximide and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Methsuximide is used to control absence seizures (petit mal; a type of seizure in which there is a very short loss of awareness during which the person may stare straight ahead or blink his eyes and does not respond to others) that cannot be treated with other medications. Methsuximide is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000777-2" qtype="usage">How should Methsuximide be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Methsuximide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken one or more times a day. Take methsuximide at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take methsuximide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of methsuximide and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once a week. Methsuximide may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take methsuximide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking methsuximide without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking methsuximide, your seizures may worsen. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000777-4" qtype="precautions">Are there safety concerns or special precautions about Methsuximide ?</Question>
			<Answer>Before taking methsuximide, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to methsuximide, ethosuximide (Zarontin), or any other medications., tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention antidepressants; other medications for seizures such as phenobarbital and phenytoin (Dilantin); medications for pain; sedatives; sleeping pills; and tranquilizers. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects., tell your doctor if you have or have ever had mental illness or kidney or liver disease., tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking methsuximide, call your doctor., if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking methsuximide., you should know that this medication may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you., talk to your doctor about the safe use of alcohol while you are taking this medication., you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking methsuximide. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants such as methsuximide to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as one week after they started taking the medication. There is a risk that you may experience changes in your mental health if you take an anticonvulsant medication such as methsuximide, but there may also be a risk that you will experience changes in your mental health if your condition is not treated.  You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood); talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or to end your life; withdrawing from friends and family; preoccupation with death and dying; giving away prized possessions; or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000777-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Methsuximide ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature, away from light, excess heat, and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
