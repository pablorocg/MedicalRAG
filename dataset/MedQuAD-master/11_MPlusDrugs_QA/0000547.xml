			<Question qid="0000547-2" qtype="usage">How should Gemcitabine Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Gemcitabine comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid to be injected over 30 minutes intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a medical facility. When gemcitabine is used to treat ovarian or breast cancer, it is usually given on certain days every 3 weeks. When gemcitabine is used to treat lung cancer, it is usually given on certain days every 3 or 4 weeks. When gemcitabine is used to treat pancreatic cancer, it may be injected once every week. The length of treatment depends on the types of drugs you are taking, how well your body responds to them, and the type of cancer or condition you have. Your doctor may need to stop or delay your treatment if you experience certain side effects. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>
