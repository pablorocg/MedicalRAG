			<Question qid="0001048-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Raltegravir and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Raltegravir is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults and children who weigh at least 4.5 lbs (2 kg). Raltegravir is in a class of medications called HIV integrase inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although raltegravir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001048-2" qtype="usage">How should Raltegravir be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Raltegravir comes as a tablet, a chewable tablet, and as granules for oral suspension to take by mouth. Raltegravir (Isentress &#174; ) tablets, chewable tablets, and oral suspension are usually taken with or without food twice a day. Raltegravir (Isentress &#174;  HD) tablets are usually taken with or without food once a day. Take raltegravir at the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take raltegravir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If you are taking the chewable tablets, you may chew or swallow them whole. For children who have trouble chewing, the chewable tablets may be crushed and mixed with 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of liquid such as water, juice, or breast milk in a clean cup. The tablets will absorb the liquid and fall apart within 2 minutes. Using a spoon, crush any remaining pieces of the tablets. Drink the mixture right away. If any of the medication is left in the cup, add another teaspoonful (5 mL) of liquid, swirl and take it right away. Before you take raltegravir oral suspension for the first time, read the written instructions that come with it that describe how to prepare the medication. Empty the contents of one granule packet into the mixing cup and add 2 teaspoons (10 mL) of water. Gently swirl the contents in the mixing cup for 45 seconds; do not shake. Use the dosing syringe provided to measure the amount of medication that your doctor has prescribed. Use the mixture within 30 minutes of preparation and discard any remaining suspension. Continue to take raltegravir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking raltegravir or your other anti-HIV medications without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking raltegravir or skip doses, your condition may become worse and the virus may become resistant to treatment. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001048-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Raltegravir ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not remove the desiccant (small packet included with the tablets to absorb moisture) from your bottle. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
