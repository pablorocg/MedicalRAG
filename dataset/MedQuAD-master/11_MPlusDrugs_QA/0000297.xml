			<Question qid="0000297-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Cyanocobalamin Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cyanocobalamin injection is used to treat and prevent a lack of vitamin B 12  that may be caused by any of the following: pernicious anemia (lack of a natural substance needed to absorb vitamin B 12  from the intestine); certain diseases, infections, or medications that decrease the amount of vitamin B 12  absorbed from food; or a vegan diet (strict vegetarian diet that does not allow any animal products, including dairy products and eggs). Lack of vitamin B 12  may cause anemia (condition in which the red blood cells do not bring enough oxygen to the organs) and permanent damage to the nerves. Cyanocobalamin injection also may be given as a test to see how well the body can absorb vitamin B 12 . Cyanocobalamin injection is in a class of medications called vitamins. Because it is injected straight into the bloodstream, it can be used to supply vitamin B 12  to people who cannot absorb this vitamin through the intestine.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000297-2" qtype="usage">How should Cyanocobalamin Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cyanocobalamin comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected into a muscle or just under the skin. It is usually injected by a healthcare provider in an office or clinic. You will probably receive cyanocobalamin injection once a day for the first 6-7 days of your treatment. As your red blood cells return to normal, you will probably receive the medication every other day for 2 weeks, and then every 3-4 days for 2-3 weeks. After your anemia has been treated, you will probably receive the medication once a month to prevent your symptoms from coming back. Cyanocobalamin injection will supply you with enough vitamin B 12  only as long as you receive injections regularly. You may receive cyanocobalamin injections every month for the rest of your life. Keep all appointments to receive cyanocobalamin injections even if you feel well. If you stop receiving cyanocobalamin injections, your anemia may return and your nerves may be damaged.</Answer>
