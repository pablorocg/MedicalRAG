			<Question qid="0000169-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Budesonide Oral Inhalation and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Budesonide is used to prevent difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, and coughing caused by asthma. Budesonide powder for oral inhalation (Pulmicort Flexhaler) is used in adults and children 6 years of age and older. Budesonide suspension (liquid) for oral inhalation (Pulmicort Respules) is used in children 12 months to 8 years of age. Budesonide belongs to a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by decreasing swelling and irritation in the airways to allow for easier breathing.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000169-2" qtype="usage">How should Budesonide Oral Inhalation be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Budesonide comes as a powder to inhale by mouth using an inhaler and as a suspension to inhale by mouth using a special jet nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). Budesonide powder for oral inhalation is usually inhaled twice a day. Budesonide suspension for oral inhalation is usually inhaled once or twice a day. Try to use budesonide at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use budesonide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Talk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with budesonide inhalation. If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting after you begin to use budesonide. Budesonide controls symptoms of asthma but does not cure it. Improvement in your asthma may occur as soon after using the medication, but full effects of may not be seen for 1 to 2 weeks after using the powder and 4 to 6 weeks after using the suspension on a regular basis. Continue to use budesonide even if you feel well. Do not stop using budesonide without talking to your doctor. Call your doctor if your symptoms or your child's symptoms do not improve during the first 2 weeks (powder) or first 6 weeks (suspension) or if they get worse. Budesonide helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks. Tell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment. Each budesonide inhaler is designed to provide 60 or 120 inhalations, depending on its size. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last. Dispose of the inhaler after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. Do not swallow budesonide nebulizer suspension. Before you use budesonide inhaler or jet nebulizer the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler or nebulizer. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you the right way to use the inhaler or nebulizer. Practice using the inhaler or nebulizer in front of him or her, so you are sure you are doing it the right way. To inhale the powder using the inhaler, follow these steps:
 Turn the protective cover and lift it off., The first time you use a new budesonide inhaler you must prime it. To do this, hold the inhaler upright (with mouthpiece up), then twist the brown grip fully to the right as far as it will go, then back again fully to the left. You will hear a click. Repeat. The unit is now primed and ready to load the first dose. You do not have to prime the inhaler again after this, even if you do not use it for a long time., Holding the inhaler upright, load the first dose by turning the grip fully to the right and fully to the left until it clicks., Turn your head away from the inhaler and breathe out. Do not blow or exhale into the inhaler. Do not shake the inhaler after loading it., Hold the inhaler in the upright (mouthpiece up) or horizontal position. Place the mouthpiece between your lips well into your mouth. Tilt your head slightly back. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece, but do not bite or chew the mouthpiece. Inhale deeply and forcefully. Be sure that the mist goes into your throat and is not blocked by your teeth or tongue., Remove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for about 10 seconds. Do not blow or exhale through the inhaler., If you are to inhale two puffs, repeat steps 4-6. For the next puff the inhaler must be loaded in the upright position right before its use. Turn the grip fully to the right and then fully to the left until it clicks., Replace the protective cap on the inhaler and twist it shut., After each treatment, rinse your mouth with water and spit. Do not swallow the water., Keep the inhaler clean and dry with the cover tightly in place at all times.,  To inhale the suspension using the jet nebulizer, follow these steps:
 Remove one ampule of inhalation suspension from the foil pouch., Gently shake the ampule in a circular motion., Hold the ampule upright and twist off the top of the ampule. Pour all of the liquid into the nebulizer reservoir. Do not mix other medications with budesonide in the reservoir., Connect the nebulizer reservoir to the mouthpiece or face mask., Connect the nebulizer to the compressor., Place the mouthpiece in your child's mouth or use the face mask. Have your child sit in an upright, comfortable position and turn on the compressor., Tell your child to breathe in calmly, deeply, and evenly until mist stops forming in the chamber., After each treatment, have your child rinse their mouth with water and spit; do not swallow the water., Dispose of the empty ampule and its top in a trash can that is out of the reach of children and pets., Clean your nebulizer regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your nebulizer., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000169-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Budesonide Oral Inhalation ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Keep the nebulizer ampules sealed in their foil pouches until you are ready to use them. Store the inhaler and nebulizer solution at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not refrigerate or freeze the nebulizer solution. If you are using the inhalation powder, replace your old inhaler each time you refill your prescription. If you are using the nebulizer solution, you must dispose of the ampules if unused 2 weeks after opening the foil pouch. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
