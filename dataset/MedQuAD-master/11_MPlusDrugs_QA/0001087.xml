			<Question qid="0001087-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Rosuvastatin and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rosuvastatin is used together with diet, weight-loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Rosuvastatin is also used to decrease the amount of cholesterol such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood. Rosuvastatin may also be used together with diet to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in adults and children and teenagers 8 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Rosuvastatin is used together with diet, and alone or in combination with other medications, to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in adults and children and teenagers 7 to 17 years of age who have familial homozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Rosuvastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with rosuvastatin has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001087-2" qtype="usage">How should Rosuvastatin be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rosuvastatin comes as a tablet (Crestor) and a capsule (Ezallor) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take rosuvastatin at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rosuvastatin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of rosuvastatin and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 2 to 4 weeks. Swallow the tablets (Crestor) whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Swallow the capsules (Ezallor) whole; do not chew or crush them. If you cannot swallow the capsule, open the capsule and carefully sprinkle the contents onto 1 teaspoonful of applesauce or chocolate or vanilla pudding. Stir the mixture for 10&#8211;15 seconds and swallow the entire mixture within 60 minutes of mixing, without chewing. Do not save the mixture for later use. If you have a nasogastric (NG) tube, your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to prepare rosuvastatin capsules (Ezallor) to give through an NG tube. Continue to take rosuvastatin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking rosuvastatin without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001087-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Rosuvastatin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
