			<Question qid="0001209-2" qtype="usage">How should Tiludronate be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tiludronate comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken on an empty stomach once a day for 3 months. This treatment may be repeated if symptoms come back or worsen after some time has passed. Take tiludronate at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tiludronate exactly as directed. Do not take it more or less often or for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor. Take tiludronate with a full glass (6 to 8 ounces [180 to 240 milliliters]) of plain water. Do not take tiludronate with any other liquid, including mineral water. Do not eat or drink for 2 hours before or 2 hours after you take tiludronate. Do not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking this medication. Tiludronate controls Paget's disease of bone only when it is taken as prescribed. Do not stop taking tiludronate without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001209-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Tiludronate ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Do not remove the tablets from the foil strip until you are ready to take them. Store this medication at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
