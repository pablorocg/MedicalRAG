			<Question qid="0001058-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Regorafenib and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Regorafenib is used to treat colon and rectal cancer (cancer that begins in the large intestine or the rectum) that has spread to other parts of the body in people who have not been treated successfully with certain other medications. It is also used to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST; a type of tumor that grows in the stomach, intestine [bowel], or esophagus [tube that connects the throat with the stomach]) in people who were not treated successfully with certain other medications. Regorafenib is also used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; a type of liver cancer) in people who were previously treated with sorafenib (Nexafar). Regorafenib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps to slow or stop the spread of cancer cells.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001058-3" qtype="usage">How should Regorafenib be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Regorafenib comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with a low-fat meal (containing under 600 calories and less than 30% of calories from fat) once a day for 3 weeks and then skipped for 1 week. This treatment period is called a cycle, and the cycle may be repeated for as long as your doctor recommends. Take regorafenib at the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take regorafenib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Your doctor may decrease your dose of regorafenib or tell you to stop taking regorafenib for a period of time during your treatment. This will depend on how well the medication works for you and any side effects you may experience. Continue to take regorafenib even if you feel well. Do not stop taking regorafenib without talking to your doctor. Regorafenib is not available at retail pharmacies. Your medication will be mailed to you or to your doctor from a specialty pharmacy. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how you will receive your medication. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001058-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Regorafenib ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Do not place the tablets in other containers, such as daily or weekly pill boxes, and do not remove the desiccant (drying agent) from the container. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Dispose of any unused tablets 7 weeks after the bottle is first opened. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
