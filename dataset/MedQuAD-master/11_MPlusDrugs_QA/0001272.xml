			<Question qid="0001272-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Valsartan and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Valsartan is used in adults and in children 1 year of age and older alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure.  It is also used in adults to treat heart failure (condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the rest of the body) and to improve survival after a heart attack. Valsartan is in a class of medications called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances that tighten the blood vessels, allowing the blood to flow more smoothly and the heart to pump more efficiently. High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001272-3" qtype="usage">How should Valsartan be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Valsartan comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth.  For the treatment of high blood pressure, the tablet or suspension is usually taken once a day with or without food.  For the treatment of heart failure or heart attack, it is usually taken twice a day with or without food. To help you remember to take valsartan, take it at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take valsartan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Shake the suspension well for at least 10 seconds before each use to mix the medication evenly. Each valsartan product releases the medication differently in your body and cannot be used interchangeably. Only take the valsartan product prescribed by your doctor and do not switch to a different valsartan product unless your doctor says that you should. Your doctor will probably only tell you to take valsartan suspension if you are younger than 5 years of age or unable to swallow tablets. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of valsartan and gradually increase your dose. Valsartan controls high blood pressure and heart failure but does not cure them. Your blood pressure may decrease during the first 2 weeks of your treatment, but it may take 4 weeks for you to notice the full benefit of valsartan. Continue to take valsartan even if you feel well. Do not stop taking valsartan without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001272-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Valsartan ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store the tablets at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). The suspension can be stored for 30 days at room temperature or for 75 days in a refrigerator; after these times it must be discarded. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
