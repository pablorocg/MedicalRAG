			<Question qid="0000325-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Darunavir and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Darunavir is used with a pharmacokinetic booster (a medication that increases the amount of other medications in the body) such as ritonavir (Norvir) or cobicistat (Tybost), and other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults and children 3 years of age and older. Darunavir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although darunavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000325-2" qtype="usage">How should Darunavir be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Darunavir comes as a tablet and oral suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food and with ritonavir once or twice a day or with food and with cobicistat once a day. Take darunavir at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take darunavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not take darunavir without ritonavir or cobicistat. Swallow the tablets/capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Shake the suspension well right before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the oral dosing syringe that came with the medication to withdraw the right amount of suspension from the bottle. You can swallow the suspension straight from the syringe. Wash the syringe with water and allow it to dry thoroughly after use. Darunavir controls HIV but does not cure it. Darunavir also does not treat HIV infection alone and must always be given with a complete regimen. It is important that all of the medications prescribed by your doctor to treat HIV infection are taken together so that the medications will continue to work to control the infection. Continue to take darunavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking darunavir without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking darunavir or skip doses, your condition may become more difficult to treat. When your supply of darunavir starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

Ask your doctor to help you choose a method of birth control that will work for you., you should know that your body fat may increase or move to different areas of your body such as your breasts, upper back, neck, chest, and stomach area.

			<Question qid="0000325-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Darunavir ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
