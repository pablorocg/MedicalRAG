			<Question qid="0001096-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Saquinavir and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Saquinavir is used in combination with ritonavir (Norvir) and other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Saquinavir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although saquinavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001096-2" qtype="usage">How should Saquinavir be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Saquinavir comes as a capsule and a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken at the same time as ritonavir (Norvir) two times a day within 2 hours after a full meal. It may be easier to remember to take saquinavir if you take it with meals. Take saquinavir at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take saquinavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole; do not chew, or crush them. If you are not able to swallow the capsule whole, you can take saquinavir by opening the capsule and mixing the contents with sugar syrup, sorbitol, or jam. To prepare each dose, add 3 teaspoons (15 mL) of sugar syrup, sorbitol, or jam to an empty container. Open the saquinavir capsule and add the contents to the container. Stir the mixture for 30 to 60 seconds. If you used cold syrup, sorbitol, or jam, wait for the mixture to come to room temperature before eating. Be sure to eat the entire mixture so that you receive the full dose. Continue to take saquinavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking saquinavir without talking to your doctor. If you miss doses, take less than the prescribed dose or stop taking saquinavir, your condition may become more difficult to treat. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with saquinavir and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001096-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Saquinavir ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
