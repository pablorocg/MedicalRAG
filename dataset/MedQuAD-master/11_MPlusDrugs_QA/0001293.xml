			<Question qid="0001293-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Vorapaxar and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Vorapaxar is used together with other medications, such as aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix), to reduce the risk of serious or life-threatening heart or blood vessel problems such as heart attack and stroke in people who have already had a heart attack or have problems with the blood flow in their legs. Vorapaxar is in a class of medications called protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) antagonists.

			<Question qid="0001293-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Vorapaxar ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not remove the desiccant (drying agent) from the bottle, if one has been provided. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
