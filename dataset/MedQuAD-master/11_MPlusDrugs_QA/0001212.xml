			<Question qid="0001212-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Tinidazole and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tinidazole is used to treat trichomoniasis (a sexually transmitted disease that can affect men and women), giardiasis (an infection of the intestine that can cause diarrhea, gas, and stomach cramps), and amebiasis (an infection of the intestine that can cause diarrhea, gas, and stomach cramps and can spread to other organs such as the liver). Tinidazole is also used to treat bacterial vaginosis (an infection caused by an overgrowth of harmful bacteria in the vagina) in women. Tinidazole is in a class of medications called nitroimidazole  antimicrobials. It works by killing the organisms that can cause infection. Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001212-3" qtype="usage">How should Tinidazole be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tinidazole comes as a suspension (liquid) prepared by the pharmacist and a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food as a single dose or once a day for 2 to 5 days. To help you remember to take tinidazole (if you are to take it for more than one day), take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tinidazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Shake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Take tinidazole until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking tinidazole too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely cured and bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001212-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Tinidazole ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Protect the medication from light. Discard any remaining liquid after 7 days. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001212-11" qtype="other information">What other information should I know about Tinidazole ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain lab tests to check your body's response to tinidazole. Before having any laboratory test, tell your doctor and the laboratory personnel that you are taking tinidazole. Do not let anyone else take your medication. Your prescription is probably not refillable. If you still have symptoms of infection after you finish the tinidazole, call your doctor. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.</Answer>
