			<Question qid="0000314-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Dalbavancin Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dalbavancin injection is used to treat skin infections caused by certain types of bacteria. Dalbavancin is in a class of medications called lipoglycopeptide antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as dalbavancin will not kill viruses that can cause colds, flu, or other infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>
