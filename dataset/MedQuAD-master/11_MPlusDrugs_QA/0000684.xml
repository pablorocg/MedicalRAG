			<Question qid="0000684-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Lenvatinib and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lenvatinib is used to treat a certain type of thyroid cancer that has returned or that has spread to other parts of the body and cannot be treated with radioactive iodine. Lenvatinib is also used along with everolimus (Afinitor, Zortress) to treat renal cell carcinoma (RCC, a type of cancer that begins in the kidney) in people who have previously received treatment with another chemotherapy medication. Lenvatinib is also used along with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) as an initial treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma. Lenvatinib is also used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; a type of liver cancer) that cannot be treated with surgery. Lenvatinib is also used along with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) to treat a certain type of cancer of the endometrium (lining of the uterus) that has spread to other parts of the body or worsened during or after treatment with chemotherapy medications or that cannot be treated with surgery or radiation therapy. Lenvatinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop the spread of cancer cells.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000684-2" qtype="usage">How should Lenvatinib be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lenvatinib comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once daily with or without food. Take lenvatinib at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take lenvatinib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the capsules whole; do not open, chew, or crush them. If you are unable to swallow the capsules, you may dissolve them in water or apple juice. Place the prescribed number of capsules (up to 5 capsules) into a small (20 mlL) container or oral syringe. Add about 3 mL of water or apple juice. Do not break or crush the capsules. Leave the capsules in the liquid for at least 10 minutes and then stir the contents for at least 3 minutes. Drink the mixture. After drinking the mixture, add another 2 mL of water or apple juice to the container or oral syringe. Swirl the contents a few times and swallow the mixture. Repeat until there is no mixture left in the container or oral syringe. Lenvatinib capsules can be given through certain types of feeding tubes. If you have a feeding tube, ask your doctor how you should take the medication. Follow the directions carefully. Your doctor may decrease your dose of lenvatinib or tell you to stop taking the medication for a time or permanently if you experience serious side effects. Be sure to talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment with lenvatinib. The length of your treatment depends on how well you respond to the medication and the side effects you experience. Continue to take lenvatinib even if you feel well. Do not stop taking lenvatinib without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000684-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Lenvatinib ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Lenvatinib capsules that have been dissolved in water or apple juice can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours after mixing. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
