			<Question qid="0000138-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Betaine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Betaine is used to treat homocystinuria (an inherited condition in which the body cannot break down a certain protein, causing build-up of homocysteine in the blood). Increased amounts of homocysteine in the body can cause symptoms such as extreme tiredness, seizures, dislocation of the lens of the eye, abnormal bone structure, osteoporosis (weak bones), blood clots, or decreased weight or rate of weight gain and slowed development in children. Betaine is in a class of medications called nutrients. It works by decreasing the amount of homocysteine in the blood.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000138-2" qtype="usage">How should Betaine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Betaine comes as a powder to be mixed with food or drink and taken by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day. Take betaine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take betaine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of betaine and gradually increase your dose based on your body's response to the medication. Your doctor may tell you to take other medications such as vitamin B 6  (pyridoxine), vitamin B 12  (cobalamin), and folic acid together with betaine. Betaine controls homocystinuria but does not cure it. Continue to take betaine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking betaine without talking to your doctor. To use betaine powder, follow these steps:
 Shake the bottle gently before removing the cap., Using the measuring scoop provided, measure the number of scoops your doctor has prescribed. One level scoop of powder is equal to 1 gram of betaine., Mix the measured amount of powder with 4 to 6 ounces (120 to 180 milliliters) of water, juice, milk, or formula until the powder is completely dissolved. Betaine powder may also be mixed with food., Drink or eat the mixture immediately., Replace the cap tightly on the bottle after using., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000138-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Betaine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
