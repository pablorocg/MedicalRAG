			<Question qid="0000619-1" qtype="why get vaccinated">Why get vaccinated with Influenza Vaccine, Live Intranasal ?</Question>
			<Answer>Influenza vaccine can prevent influenza (flu). Flu is a contagious disease that spreads around the United States every year, usually between October and May. Anyone can get the flu, but it is more dangerous for some people. Infants and young children, people 65 years of age and older, pregnant people, and people with certain health conditions or a weakened immune system are at greatest risk of flu complications. Pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections and ear infections are examples of flu-related complications. If you have a medical condition, such as heart disease, cancer or diabetes, flu can make it worse. Flu can cause fever and chills, sore throat, muscle aches, fatigue, cough, headache, and runny or stuffy nose. Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults. Each year thousands of people in the United States die from flu, and many more are hospitalized. Flu vaccine prevents millions of illnesses and flu-related visits to the doctor each year.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000619-2" qtype="information">What is Influenza Vaccine, Live Intranasal ?</Question>
			<Answer>CDC recommends everyone 6 months of age and older get vaccinated every flu season. Children 6 months through 8 years of age may need 2 doses during a single flu season. Everyone else needs only 1 dose each flu season. Live, attenuated influenza vaccine (called LAIV) is a nasal spray vaccine that may be given to nonpregnant people 2 through 49 years of age. It takes about 2 weeks for protection to develop after vaccination. There are many flu viruses, and they are always changing. Each year a new flu vaccine is made to protect against three or four viruses that are likely to cause disease in the upcoming flu season. Even when the vaccine doesn't exactly match these viruses, it may still provide some protection. Influenza vaccine does not cause flu. Influenza vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines.</Answer>
