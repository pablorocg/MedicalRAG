			<Question qid="0001047-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Raloxifene ?</Question>
			<Answer>Taking raloxifene may increase the risk that you will develop a blood clot in your legs or lungs. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a blood clot in your legs, lungs, or eyes. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take raloxifene. Stop taking raloxifene and call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms: leg pain; feeling of warmth in the lower leg; swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs; sudden chest pain; shortness of breath; coughing up blood; or sudden changes in vision, such as loss of vision or blurred vision. Remaining still for a long time may increase the chance that you will develop a blood clot. Your doctor will probably tell you to stop taking raloxifene at least three days before a scheduled surgery and not to take the medication if you require an extended period of bed rest for any reason. If you will be having surgery, be sure to tell your doctor that you are taking raloxifene. If you travel while you are taking raloxifene, avoid remaining still (such as sitting in an airplane or car) for long periods of time during your trip. If you have coronary artery disease (hardening of the arteries that lead to the heart that may cause chest pain or heart attacks) or if you are at high risk of developing coronary artery disease, taking raloxifene may increase the chance that you will have a serious or fatal stroke.  Tell your doctor if you have ever had a stroke or mini-stroke, if you smoke, and if you have or have ever had high blood pressure or an irregular heartbeat. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with raloxifene and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001047-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Raloxifene and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Raloxifene is used to prevent and treat osteoporosis (condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) in postmenopausal (women who have experienced a change of life; end of menstrual periods) women. Raloxifene is also used to decrease the risk of developing invasive breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread outside of the milk ducts or lobules into the surrounding breast tissue) in postmenopausal women who are at high risk of developing this type of cancer or who have osteoporosis. Raloxifene cannot be used to treat invasive breast cancer or to prevent invasive breast cancer from coming back in women who have already had the condition. Raloxifene also cannot be used to decrease the risk of developing noninvasive breast cancer. Raloxifene should  not  be used in women who have not yet experienced menopause. Raloxifene is in a class of medications called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Raloxifene prevents and treats osteoporosis by mimicking the effects of estrogen (a female hormone produced by the body) to increase the density (thickness) of bone. Raloxifene decreases the risk of developing invasive breast cancer by blocking the effects of estrogen on breast tissue. This may stop the development of tumors that need estrogen to grow.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001047-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Raloxifene ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
