			<Question qid="0000213-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Cefotetan Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cefotetan injection is used to treat infections of the lungs, skin, bones, joints, stomach area, blood, female reproductive organs, and urinary tract. Cefotetan injection is also used before surgery to prevent infections. Cefotetan injection is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as cefotetan injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000213-2" qtype="usage">How should Cefotetan Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cefotetan injection comes as a powder to be added to fluid and injected intravenously (into a vein) or it can be injected into a large muscle. Cefotetan injection is also available as a premixed product to be injected intravenously.  It is usually given every 12 or 24 hours. You may receive cefotetan injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you will be receiving cefotetan injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with cefotetan injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Use cefotetan injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using cefotetan injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>
