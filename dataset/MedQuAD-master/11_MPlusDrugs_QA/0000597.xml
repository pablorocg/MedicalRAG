			<Answer>Ibandronate injection is used to treat osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) in women who have undergone menopause (''change of life;'' end of menstrual periods). Ibandronate is in a class of medications called bisphosphonates. It works by preventing bone breakdown and increasing bone density (thickness).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000597-2" qtype="usage">How should Ibandronate Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ibandronate injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected into a vein by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or clinic. Ibandronate injection is usually given once every 3 months. Your doctor will tell you to take supplements of calcium and vitamin D while you are being treated with ibandronate injection. Take these supplements exactly as directed. You may experience a reaction after you receive your first dose of ibandronate injection. You probably will not experience this reaction after you receive later doses of ibandronate injection. Symptoms of this reaction may include flu-like symptoms, fever, headache, and bone or muscle pain. Your doctor may recommend that you take a mild pain reliever to prevent or treat these symptoms. Ibandronate injection controls osteoporosis but does not cure it. Ibandronate injection helps to treat osteoporosis only as long as you receive regular injections. It is important that you receive your ibandronate injection once every 3 months for as long as your doctor prescribes it, but you should talk to your doctor from time to time about whether you still need to receive ibandronate injection. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with ibandronate injection and each time you receive a dose. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

Talk to your doctor before having any dental treatments while you are receiving this medication., you should know that ibandronate injection may cause severe bone, muscle, or joint pain.

Call your doctor right away if you experience severe pain at any time during your treatment with ibandronate injection. Your doctor may stop giving you ibandronate injection and your pain may go away after you stop treatment with this medication., talk to your doctor about other things you can do to prevent osteoporosis from developing or worsening.

 stomach pain, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, heartburn, back pain, rash, pain in the arms or legs, weakness, tiredness, dizziness, headache, fever, sore throat, chills, cough, and other signs of infection, frequent or urgent need to urinate, painful urination, redness or swelling at injection spot,  Some side effects can be serious.

Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while receiving this medication. Being treated with a bisphosphonate medication such as ibandronate injection for osteoporosis may increase the risk that you will break your thigh bone(s).
