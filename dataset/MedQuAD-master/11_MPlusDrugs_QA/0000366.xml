			<Question qid="0000366-2" qtype="usage">How should Diflorasone Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use diflorasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. To use diflorasone topical, apply a small amount the ointment or cream to cover the affected area of skin with a thin film. This medication is only for use on the skin. Do not let diflorasone topical get into your eyes or mouth and do not swallow it.Avoid use on the face, in the genital and rectal areas, and in skin creases and armpits unless directed by your doctor. If you are using diflorasone on a child's diaper area, do not use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants. Such use may increase side effects. Do not apply other skin preparations or products on the treated area without talking with your doctor. Do not wrap or bandage the treated area unless your doctor tells you that you should.

			<Question qid="0000366-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Diflorasone Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
