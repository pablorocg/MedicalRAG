			<Question qid="0000267-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Clindamycin Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Many antibiotics, including clindamycin, may cause overgrowth of dangerous bacteria in the large intestine. This may cause mild diarrhea or may cause a life-threatening condition called colitis (inflammation of the large intestine). Clindamycin is more likely to cause this type of infection than many other antibiotics, so it should only be used to treat serious infections that cannot be treated by other antibiotics. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had colitis or other conditions that affect your stomach or intestine. You may develop these problems during your treatment or up to several months after your treatment has ended. Call your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms during your treatment with clindamycin injection or during the first several months after your treatment is finished: watery or bloody stools, diarrhea, stomach cramps, or fever. Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving clindamycin injection.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000267-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Clindamycin Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Clindamycin injection is used to treat certain types of bacterial infections, including infections of the lungs, skin, blood, bones, joints, female reproductive organs, and internal organs. Clindamycin is in a class of medications called lincomycin antibiotics. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics such as clindamycin will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000267-3" qtype="usage">How should Clindamycin Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Clindamycin injection comes as a liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) over a period of 10 to 40 minutes or intramuscularly (into a muscle). It is usually given two to four times a day. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have and how well you respond to the medication. You may receive clindamycin injection in a hospital, or you may be given the medication to use at home. If you have been told to use clindamycin injection at home, it is very important that you use the medication exactly as directed. Use clindamycin injection at about the same times every day. Follow the directions that you are given carefully, and ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you have any questions. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with clindamycin injection. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor. Use clindamycin injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using clindamycin injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>
