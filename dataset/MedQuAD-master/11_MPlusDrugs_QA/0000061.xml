			<Question qid="0000061-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Amlexanox and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Amlexanox is used to treat ulcers of the mouth called aphthous ulcers or canker sores. It decreases the time ulcers take to heal. Because amlexanox decreases the healing time, it also decreases the pain you feel. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor, dentist, or pharmacist for more information.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000061-2" qtype="usage">How should Amlexanox be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Amlexanox comes as a beige-colored paste. Amlexanox should be used as soon as possible after noticing symptoms of an ulcer. Amlexanox is usually applied four times a day, following brushing and flossing after breakfast, lunch, dinner, and at bedtime. Squeeze 1/4 inch (0.6 centimeters) of the paste on your finger. With gentle pressure, dab amlexanox onto each ulcer in the mouth. Wash hands immediately after using amlexanox. Amlexanox is only used until the ulcer has healed, usually within 10 days. Contact your physician or dentist if significant healing has not occurred within 10 days. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor, dentist, or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use amlexanox exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor or dentist.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000061-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Amlexanox ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
