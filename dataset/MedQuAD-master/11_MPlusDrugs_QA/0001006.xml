			<Question qid="0001006-2" qtype="usage">How should Pralatrexate Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pralatrexate injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a hospital or clinic. It is usually given over a period of 3 to 5 minutes once a week for 6 weeks as part of a 7-week cycle. Your treatment will probably continue until your condition worsens or you develop serious side effects. Your doctor may need to adjust your dose, skip a dose, or stop your treatment if you experience certain side effects. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with pralatrexate injection. You will need to take folic acid and vitamin B 12  during your treatment with pralatrexate injection to help prevent certain side effects. Your doctor will probably tell you to take folic acid by mouth every day beginning 10 days before you start your treatment and for 30 days after your final dose of pralatrexate injection. Your doctor will also probably tell you that you will need to receive a vitamin B 12  injection no more than 10 weeks before your first dose of pralatrexate injection and every 8 to 10 weeks for as long as your treatment continues.</Answer>
