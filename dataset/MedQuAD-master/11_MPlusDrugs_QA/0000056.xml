			<Question qid="0000056-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Aminocaproic Acid Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Aminocaproic acid injection is used to control bleeding that occurs when blood clots are broken down too quickly. This type of bleeding may occur during or after heart or liver surgery; in people who have certain bleeding disorders; in people who have cancer of the prostate (a male reproductive gland), lung, stomach, or cervix (opening of the uterus); and in pregnant women experiencing placental abruption (placenta separates from the uterus before the baby is ready to be born). Aminocaproic acid injection is also used to control bleeding in the urinary tract (the organs in the body that produce and excrete urine) that may occur after prostate or kidney surgery or in people who have certain types of cancer. Aminocaproic acid injection should not be used to treat bleeding that is not caused by faster than normal clot breakdown, so your doctor may order tests to find the cause of your bleeding before you begin your treatment. Aminocaproic acid injection is in a class of medications called hemostatics.</Answer>
