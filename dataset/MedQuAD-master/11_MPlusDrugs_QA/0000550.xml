			<Question qid="0000550-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Gentamicin Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Gentamicin injection is used to treat certain serious infections that are caused by bacteria such as meningitis (infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) and infections of the blood, abdomen (stomach area), lungs, skin, bones, joints, and urinary tract. Gentamicin injection is in a class of medications called aminoglycoside antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as gentamicin injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000550-3" qtype="usage">How should Gentamicin Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Gentamicin injection comes as a liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) or intramuscularly (into a muscle). When gentamicin is injected intravenously, it is usually infused (injected slowly) over a period of 30 minutes to 2 hours once every 6 or 8 hours. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have. You may receive gentamicin injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you will be receiving gentamicin injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with gentamicin injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Use gentamicin injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using gentamicin injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>
