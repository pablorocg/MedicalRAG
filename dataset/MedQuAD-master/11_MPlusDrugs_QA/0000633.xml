			<Question qid="0000633-2" qtype="usage">How should Interferon Beta-1b Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Interferon beta-1b injection comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid and injected subcutaneously (just under the skin). It is usually injected every other day. Inject interferon beta-1b injection at around the same time of day each time you inject it. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use interferon beta-1b injection exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of interferon beta-1b injection and gradually increase your dose. You will receive your first dose of interferon beta-1b in your doctor's office. After that, you can inject interferon beta-1b yourself or have a friend or relative perform the injections. Your doctor or nurse will show you or a caregiver how to prepare and inject a dose of interferon beta-1b injection at home. Before you use interferon beta-1b yourself the first time, read the written instructions for use that come with it. Be sure to ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to inject the medication. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of interferon beta-1b and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 2 weeks. Never reuse or share syringes, needles, or vials of medication. Throw away used needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container and throw away used vials of medication in the trash. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container. You should only mix one vial of interferon beta-1b at a time. It is best to mix the medication right before you plan to inject it. However, you may mix the medication in advance, store it in the refrigerator, and use it within 3 hours. You can inject interferon beta-1b anywhere on your abdomen, buttocks, the back of your upper arms, or your thighs, except the 2-inch (5-centimeter) area around your navel (belly button) and waistline. If you are very thin, only inject in your thigh or the outer surface of your arm. Refer to the diagram in the manufacturer's patient information for the exact places you can inject. Choose a different spot each time you inject your medication. Do not inject your medication into skin that is irritated, bruised, reddened, infected, or scarred. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with interferon beta-1b and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000633-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Interferon Beta-1b Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store vials of interferon beta-1b powder at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). If necessary, vials containing prepared interferon beta-1b solution may be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 hours after mixing. Do not freeze interferon beta-1b. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
