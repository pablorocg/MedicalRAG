			<Question qid="0001118-3" qtype="usage">How should Sirolimus be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Sirolimus comes as a tablet and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day, either always with food or always without food. To help you remember to take sirolimus, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take sirolimus exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Your doctor will probably adjust your dose of sirolimus during your treatment, usually not more than once every 7 to 14 days. Continue to take sirolimus even if you feel well. Do not stop taking sirolimus without talking to your doctor. Sirolimus solution may develop a haze when refrigerated. If this happens, let the bottle stand at room temperature and gently shake it until the haze goes away. The haze does not mean that the medication is damaged or unsafe to use. To use the bottles of solution, follow these steps:
 Open the solution bottle. On first use, insert the plastic tube with stopper tightly into the bottle until it is even with the top of the bottle. Do not remove from the bottle once inserted., For each use, tightly insert one of the amber syringes, with the plunger fully pushed in, into the opening in the plastic tube., Draw up the amount of solution your doctor has prescribed by gently pulling out the plunger of the syringe until the bottom of the black line of the plunger is even with the correct mark on the syringe. Keep the bottle upright. If bubbles form in the syringe, empty the syringe into the bottle and repeat this step., Empty the syringe into a glass or plastic cup containing at least 2 ounces (60 milliliters [1/4 cup]) of water or orange juice. Do not use apple juice, grapefruit juice, or other liquids. Stir vigorously for 1 minute and drink immediately., Refill the cup with at least 4 ounces (120 milliliters [1/2 cup]) of water or orange juice. Stir vigorously and drink the rinse solution., Dispose of the used syringe.,  If you need to carry a filled syringe with you, snap a cap onto the syringe and put the syringe in the carrying case. Use the medication in the syringe within 24 hours.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001118-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Sirolimus ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store tablets at room temperature and away from light, excess heat, and moisture (not in the bathroom). Keep liquid medication in the refrigerator, away from light, closed tightly, and dispose of any unused medication one month after the bottle is opened. Do not freeze. If needed, you may store the bottles for up to 15 days at room temperature. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
