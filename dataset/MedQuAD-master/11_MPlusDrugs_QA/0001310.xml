			<Question qid="0001310-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Zolmitriptan nasal spray is used to treat the symptoms of migraine headaches (severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea and sensitivity to sound and light). Zolmitriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels around the brain, stopping pain signals from being sent to the brain, and blocking the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms of migraine. Zolmitriptan does not prevent migraine attacks or reduce the number of headaches you have.</Answer>

			<Answer>Zolmitriptan comes as a spray to inhale through the nose. It is usually used at the first sign of a migraine headache. If your symptoms improve after you use zolmitriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may use a second dose of zolmitriptan.

			<Question qid="0001310-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Zolmitriptan Nasal Spray ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
