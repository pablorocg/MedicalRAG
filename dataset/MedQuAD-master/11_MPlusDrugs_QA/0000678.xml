			<Question qid="0000678-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Lanthanum and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lanthanum is used to reduce blood levels of phosphate in people with kidney disease. High levels of phosphate in the blood can cause bone problems. Lanthanum is in a class of medications called phosphate binders. It binds phosphorus that you get from foods in your diet and prevents it from being absorbed into your blood stream.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000678-2" qtype="usage">How should Lanthanum be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lanthanum comes as a chewable tablet and as an oral powder to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or immediately after food several times a day as directed by your doctor. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take lanthanum exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Chew the tablets completely before swallowing; do not swallow the tablets whole. If you have trouble chewing the tablets you may crush them before chewing. Sprinkle the oral powder on a small amount of applesauce or a similar food and take the mixture immediately, along with your meal. Do not store the prepared mixture for future use after mixing. Do not open the oral powder container until you are ready to use the medication. Do not mix lanthanum oral powder with a liquid. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of lanthanum and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 2 to 3 weeks.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000678-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Lanthanum ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
