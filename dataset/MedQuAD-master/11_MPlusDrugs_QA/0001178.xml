			<Question qid="0001178-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Tenofovir ?</Question>
			<Answer>If you have hepatitis B virus infection (HBV; an ongoing liver infection) and you take tenofovir, your condition may suddenly worsen when you stop taking this medication. Be careful not to miss doses or run out of tenofovir. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease other than hepatitis B or cirrhosis (scarring of the liver). If you experience any of the following symptoms after you stop taking tenofovir, call your doctor immediately: extreme tiredness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, yellowing of the skin or eyes, dark-colored urine, light-colored bowel movements, and muscle or joint pain. If you are taking tenofovir to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had HBV. Your doctor may test you to see if you have HBV before you begin your treatment with tenofovir. Your doctor will examine you and order lab tests regularly for several months after you stop taking this medication to see if your HBV has worsened. Tell your doctor if you experience any new or unusual symptoms after you stop taking tenofovir. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests before and during your treatment to check your body's response to tenofovir. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking tenofovir.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001178-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Tenofovir and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) (Viread) is used along with other medications to treat HIV infection in adults and children 2 years of age and older weighing 22 pounds (10 kilograms) or more. Tenofovir DF is also used to treat chronic (long term) HBV in adults and children 2 years of age and older weighing 22 pounds (10 kilograms) or more. Tenofovir alafenamide (AF) (Vemlidy) is used to treat chronic (long term) HBV in adults and children 12 years of age and older who have stable liver disease. Tenofovir is in a class of medications called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV and HBV in the blood. Although tenofovir will not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people. Tenofovir will not cure hepatitis B and may not prevent complications of chronic hepatitis B such as cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer. Tenofovir may not prevent the spread of hepatitis B to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001178-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Tenofovir ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
