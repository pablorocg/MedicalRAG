			<Question qid="0000298-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Cyanocobalamin Nasal Gel and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cyanocobalamin nasal gel is used to prevent a lack of vitamin B 12  that may be caused by any of the following: pernicious anemia (lack of a natural substance needed to absorb vitamin B 12  from the intestine); certain diseases, infections or medications that decrease the amount of vitamin B 12  absorbed from food; or a vegan diet (strict vegetarian diet that does not allow any animal products including eggs and dairy products). Lack of vitamin B 12  can cause anemia (condition in which the red blood cells do not bring enough oxygen to the organs) and permanent damage to the nerves. This anemia must be treated with vitamin B 12  injections. After the red blood cells have returned to normal, cyanocobalamin nasal gel can be used to stop anemia and other symptoms of lack of vitamin B 12  from coming back. Cyanocobalamin nasal gel is also used to supply extra vitamin B 12  to people who need unusually large amounts of this vitamin because they are pregnant or have certain diseases. Cyanocobalamin nasal gel is in a class of medications called vitamins. It enters the bloodstream through the nose, so it can be used to supply vitamin B 12  to people who cannot take in this vitamin through the intestine.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000298-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Cyanocobalamin Nasal Gel ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication upright in the carton it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children.  Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not allow the medication to freeze. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
