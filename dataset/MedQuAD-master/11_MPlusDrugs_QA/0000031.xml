			<Question qid="0000031-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Aldesleukin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Aldesleukin injection must be given in a hospital or medical facility under the supervision of a doctor who is experienced in giving chemotherapy medications for cancer. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests before and during your treatment to see if it is safe for you to receive aldesleukin injection and to check your body's response to aldesleukin injection. Aldesleukin may cause a severe and life-threatening reaction called capillary leak syndrome (a condition that causes the body to keep excess fluid, low blood pressure, and low levels of a protein [albumin] in the blood) which may result in damage to your heart, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. Capillary leak syndrome may occur immediately after aldesleukin is given. If you experience any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor immediately: swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs; weight gain; shortness of breath; fainting; dizziness or lightheadedness; confusion; bloody or black, tarry, sticky stools; chest pain; fast or irregular heartbeat. Aldesleukin may cause a decrease in the number of white blood cells in the blood. A decrease in the number of white blood cells in your body may increase the risk that you will develop a serious infection. If you experience any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor immediately: fever, chills, sore throat, cough, frequent or painful urination, or other signs of infection. Aldesleukin may affect the nervous system and can cause coma. If you experience any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor immediately: extreme sleepiness or tiredness.</Answer>
