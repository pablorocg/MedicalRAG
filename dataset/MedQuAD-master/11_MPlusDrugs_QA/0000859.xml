			<Question qid="0000859-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Nicardipine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nicardipine is used to treat high blood pressure and to control angina (chest pain). Nicardipine is in a class of medications called calcium channel blockers. It lowers blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not have to pump as hard. It controls chest pain by increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000859-2" qtype="usage">How should Nicardipine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nicardipine comes as a regular capsule and as an extended-release (long-acting) capsule to take by mouth. The regular capsule is usually taken three times a day. The extended-release capsule is usually taken two times a day. To help you remember to take nicardipine, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take nicardipine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the extended-release capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If taken regularly, nicardipine controls chest pain, but it does not stop chest pain once it starts. Your doctor may prescribe a different medication to take when you have chest pain. Nicardipine controls high blood pressure and chest pain (angina) but does not cure them. Continue to take nicardipine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking nicardipine without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000859-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Nicardipine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000859-10" qtype="other information">What other information should I know about Nicardipine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your blood pressure should be checked regularly to determine your response to nicardipine. The extended-release capsule does not dissolve in the stomach after swallowing. It slowly releases medicine as it passes through your small intestines. It is not unusual to see the capsule shell in the stool. Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.</Answer>
