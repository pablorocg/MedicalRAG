			<Question qid="0000799-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Mifepristone (Korlym) ?</Question>
			<Answer>For female patients: Do not take mifepristone if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Mifepristone can cause loss of the pregnancy. You must have a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment with mifepristone and before beginning treatment again if you stop taking it for more than 14 days. If you can become pregnant, you will need to avoid becoming pregnant during your treatment with mifepristone. You must use acceptable forms of birth control during your treatment and for at least 1 month after your treatment is completed. Your doctor will tell you which forms of birth control are acceptable. If you think you are pregnant, you miss a menstrual period, or you have sex without using birth control while taking mifepristone or within 1 month after your treatment, call your doctor immediately. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain tests to check your body's response to mifepristone. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with mifepristone and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide. Talk to your doctor about the risk(s) of taking mifepristone.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000799-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Mifepristone (Korlym) and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Mifepristone (Korlym) is used to treat hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) in people with a certain type of Cushing's syndrome in which the body makes too much cortisol (a hormone) and who have failed surgery or cannot have surgery to treat this condition. Mifepristone is in a class of medications called cortisol receptor blockers. It works by blocking the activity of cortisol. Mifepristone is also available as another product (Mifeprex) that is used alone or in combination with another medication to end an early pregnancy. This monograph only gives information about mifepristone (Korlym) used to control hyperglycemia in people with a certain type of Cushing's syndrome. If you are using mifepristone to terminate a pregnancy, read the monograph entitled mifepristone (Mifeprex), which has been written about this product.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000799-3" qtype="usage">How should Mifepristone (Korlym) be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Mifepristone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with a meal. Take mifepristone at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take mifepristone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are not able to swallow the tablets whole. Your doctor will start you on a low dose of mifepristone and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 2 to 4 weeks. If you stop taking mifepristone, call your doctor. Your doctor may have to start you again on the lowest dose of mifepristone and gradually increase your dose. Mifepristone can control your condition but does not cure it. It may take 6 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of mifepristone. Continue to take mifepristone even if you feel well.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000799-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Mifepristone (Korlym) ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
