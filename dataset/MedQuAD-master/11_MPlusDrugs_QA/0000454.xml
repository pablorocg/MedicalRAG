			<Question qid="0000454-2" qtype="usage">How should Estramustine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Estramustine comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with water 3 to 4 times a day at least one hour before or two hours after meals. Do not take estramustine with milk, milk products, or foods that contain large amounts of calcium. Take estramustine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take estramustine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Estramustine may control the spread of your cancer but does not cure it. It may take up to 3 months before your doctor can tell if this medication is helpful for your condition. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with estramustine. Continue to take estramustine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking estramustine without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000454-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Estramustine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store estramustine capsules in the refrigerator. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
