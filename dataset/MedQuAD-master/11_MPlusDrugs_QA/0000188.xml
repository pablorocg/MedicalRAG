			<Question qid="0000188-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Calcitriol Topical and why is it prescribed ?</Question>

			<Question qid="0000188-2" qtype="usage">How should Calcitriol Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Calcitriol comes as an ointment to apply to the skin. It is usually applied two times a day, in the morning and evening. Apply calcitriol ointment at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Apply calcitriol ointment exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will tell you how much ointment to apply.  In children 2 to 6 years of age, do not use more than one tube (100 gm) of calcitriol ointment per week. In adults and children 7 years of age and older, do not use more than two tubes (200 gm) of calcitriol ointment per week. Apply calcitriol ointment to the areas of skin affected by plaque psoriasis. Do not apply calcitriol ointment to healthy skin or anywhere on your face, eyes, lips, or vagina. Do not swallow the medication. Apply the ointment to the affected skin and gently rub the ointment into the skin until no medication is visible. Do not cover the skin where you applied calcitriol ointment with a bandage or dressing unless your doctor tells you that you should. Wash your hands well with soap and water after you apply calcitriol ointment.</Answer>

Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze or refrigerate calcitriol ointment. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily.
