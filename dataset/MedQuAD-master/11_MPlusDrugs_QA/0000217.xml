			<Question qid="0000217-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Ceftaroline Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ceftaroline injection is used to treat some types of skin infections caused by certain bacteria in adults, children, and infants, including newborns. Ceftaroline injection is used to treat some types of pneumonia (lung infection) caused by bacteria in adults, children, and infants 2 months of age and older. Ceftaroline is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as ceftaroline injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000217-2" qtype="usage">How should Ceftaroline Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ceftaroline injection comes as a powder to be added to fluid and given through a needle or catheter placed in your vein. It is usually injected intravenously (into a vein) over a period of 5 to 60 minutes every 12 hours for adults and every 8 or 12 hours for children and every 8 hours for infants and newborns. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have and how your body responds to the medication. You may receive ceftaroline injection in a hospital or you may give the medication at home. If you will be using ceftaroline injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of your treatment with ceftaroline injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Use ceftaroline injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using ceftaroline injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>
