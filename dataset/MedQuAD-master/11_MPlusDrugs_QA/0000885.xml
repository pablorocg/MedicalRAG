			<Question qid="0000885-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Octreotide Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Octreotide immediate-release injection is used to decrease the amount of growth hormone (a natural substance) produced by people with acromegaly (condition in which the body produces too much growth hormone, causing enlargement of the hands, feet, and facial features; joint pain; and other symptoms) who cannot be treated with surgery, radiation, or another medication. Octreotide immediate-release injection is also used to control diarrhea and flushing caused by carcinoid tumors (slow-growing tumors that release natural substances that can cause symptoms) and vasoactive intestinal peptide secreting adenomas (VIP-omas; tumors that form in the pancreas and release natural substances that can cause symptoms). Octreotide long-acting injection is used to control acromegaly, carcinoid tumors, and VIP-omas in people who have been successfully treated with octreotide injection but prefer to receive injections less often. Octreotide injection is in a class of medications called octapeptides. It works by decreasing the amounts of certain natural substances produced by the body.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000885-2" qtype="usage">How should Octreotide Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Octreotide comes as an immediate-release solution (liquid) for injection to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin) or intravenously (into a vein) Octreotide also comes as a long-acting injection to be injected into the muscles of the buttocks by a doctor or nurse. Octreotide immediate-release injection is usually injected 2 to 4 times a day. Octreotide long-acting injection is usually injected once every 4 weeks. Inject octreotide immediate-release injection at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Inject octreotide injection exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you are not already being treated with octreotide injection, you will begin your treatment with immediate-release octreotide injection. You will be treated with the immediate-release injection for 2 weeks, and your doctor may gradually increase your dose during that time. If the medication works for you and does not cause severe side effects, your doctor may give you the long-acting injection after 2 weeks. In order to control your condition, you may need to continue to receive the immediate-release injection for 2 weeks or longer after you receive your first dose of the long-acting injection. Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose of the long-acting injection 2 or 3 months after you first receive it. If you are being treated for a carcinoid tumor or VIP-oma, you may experience worsening of your symptoms from time to time during your treatment. If this happens, your doctor may tell you to use the immediate-release injection for a few days until your symptoms are controlled. If you have acromegaly and have been treated with radiation therapy, your doctor will probably tell you not to use octreotide immediate-release injection for 4 weeks every year or not to receive the octreotide long-acting injection for 8 weeks every year. This will allow your doctor to see how the radiation therapy has affected your condition and decide whether you should still be treated with octreotide. Octreotide immediate-release injection comes in vials, ampules, and dosing pens that contain cartridges of medication. Be sure you know what type of container your octreotide comes in and what other supplies, such as needles, syringes, or pens, you will need to inject your medication. If you are using the immediate-release injection from a vial, ampule or dosing pen, you may be able to inject the medication yourself at home or have a friend or relative perform the injections. Ask your doctor to show you or the person who will be performing the injections how to inject the medication. Also talk to your doctor about where on your body you should inject the medication and how you should rotate injection spots so that you do not inject in the same spot too often. Before you inject your medication, always look at the liquid.  and do not use it if it is cloudy or contains particles. Check that the expiration date has not passed, that the solution for injection contains the correct amount of liquid, and that the liquid is clear and colorless. Do not use a vial, ampule, or dosing pen if it is expired, if it does not contain the correct amount of liquid, or if the liquid is cloudy or colored. Carefully read the manufacturer's instructions for use that comes with the medication. These instructions describe how to inject a dose of octreotide injection. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions about how to inject this medication. Dispose of used dosing pens, vials, ampules, or syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container. Octreotide injection may control your symptoms, but it will not cure your condition. Continue to use octreotide injection even if you feel well. Do not stop using octreotide injection without talking to your doctor. If you stop using octreotide injection, your symptoms may return. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000885-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Octreotide Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>If you are storing the long-acting injection in your home until it is time for it to be injected by your doctor or nurse, you should store it in original carton in the refrigerator and protect it from light. If you will be storing the immediate-release solution for injection in ampules, vials, or dosing pens, you should keep it  in the original carton in the refrigerator to protect it from light; do not freeze. You may store the immediate-release injection multi-dose vials after first use at room temperature for up to 14 days. You may store the immediate-release dosing pen at room temperature after first use for up to 28 days with the pen cap always on. You may store the immediate-release injection single-dose vials and ampules at room temperature for up to 14 days, but discard any of the unused solution in the single dose ampules or vials after use. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.
