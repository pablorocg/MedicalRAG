			<Question qid="0000561-2" qtype="usage">How should Goserelin Implant be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Goserelin comes as an implant to be inserted with a syringe subcutaneously (under the skin) in your stomach area by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or clinic. An implant with 3.6 mg of goserelin is usually inserted every 4 weeks. An implant with 10.8 mg of goserelin is usually inserted every 12 weeks. The length of your treatment depends on the condition being treated and your response to the medication. Your doctor will determine how long you should use goserelin implant. Goserelin may cause an increase in certain hormones in the first few weeks after insertion of the implant. Your doctor will monitor you carefully for any new or worsening symptoms during this time.</Answer>
