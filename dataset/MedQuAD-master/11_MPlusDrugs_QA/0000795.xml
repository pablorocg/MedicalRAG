			<Question qid="0000795-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Mexiletine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Antiarrhythmic drugs, similar to mexiletine, have been reported to increase the risk of death or heart attack, especially in people who have had a heart attack within the past 2 years. Mexiletine may increase the chance of having arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and has not been proven to help people without life-threatening arrhythmias to live longer. Mexiletine should be used only to treat people with life-threatening arrhythmias. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking mexiletine.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000795-3" qtype="usage">How should Mexiletine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Mexiletine comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken three times a day, every 8 hours. Some people may take it twice daily, every 12 hours, once their arrhythmias have been controlled with mexiletine. Mexiletine should be taken with food or an antacid to prevent stomach upset. Take mexiletine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take mexiletine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You will probably be hospitalized when you begin your treatment with mexiletine. Your doctor will monitor you carefully during this time and for as long as you continue to take mexiletine. Your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of mexiletine and gradually increase or decrease your dose, not more than once every 2 to 3 days. Mexiletine controls arrhythmias but does not cure them. Continue to take mexiletine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking mexiletine without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking mexiletine, your condition may become worse.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000795-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Mexiletine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
