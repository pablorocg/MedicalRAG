			<Question qid="0000861-2" qtype="usage">How should Nicotine Lozenges be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nicotine comes as a lozenge to slowly dissolve in the mouth. It is usually used according to the directions on the package, at least 15 minutes after eating or drinking. Follow the directions on your medicine package carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nicotine lozenges exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of them or use them more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up in the morning, you should use 4-mg nicotine lozenges. If you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up in the morning, you should use 2 mg-nicotine lozenges. For weeks 1 to 6 of treatment, you should use one lozenge every 1 to 2 hours. Using at least nine lozenges per day will increase your chance of quitting. For weeks 7 to 9, you should use one lozenge every 2 to 4 hours. For weeks 10 to 12, you should use one lozenge every 4 to 8 hours. Do not use more than five lozenges in 6 hours or more than 20 lozenges per day. Do not use more than one lozenge at a time or use one lozenge right after another. Using too many lozenges at a time or one after another can cause side effects such as hiccups, heartburn, and nausea. To use the lozenge, place it in your mouth and allow it to slowly dissolve. Do not chew, crush, or swallow lozenges. Once in a while, use your tongue to move the lozenge from one side of your mouth to the other. It should take 20 to 30 minutes to dissolve. Do not eat while the lozenge is in your mouth. Stop using nicotine lozenges after 12 weeks. If you still feel the need to use nicotine lozenges, talk to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children and pets.

If you need to remove a lozenge, wrap it in paper and dispose of it in a trash can safely, out of the reach of children and pets.
