			<Question qid="0000943-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Patiromer and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Patiromer is used to treat hyperkalemia (high levels of potassium in the blood). Patiromer is in a class of medications called potassium removing agents.

			<Question qid="0000943-3" qtype="usage">How should Patiromer be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Patiromer comes as a powder to mix with water and take by mouth. It is usually taken along with food once a day. Take patiromer at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take patiromer exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it, or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You will need to mix the medication powder with water right before you take it. Do not take the powder before it is mixed with water. Do not mix the powder with any other liquid or food, except for water. To prepare each dose of your medication, pour 1/3 cup (about 3 ounces [90 mL]) of water into a cup. Add the contents of the packet(s) of patiromer into the cup along with half of the water and stir well. (You may need to use more than one packet of patiromer to make up your full dose.) Add the remaining half of the water to the cup and stir well. The powder will not completely dissolve and the mixture will look cloudy. You may need to add more water to the cup if the mixture is too thick. Drink the mixture right away. If any powder is left in the cup after drinking it, add more water, stir, and drink right away. Repeat as needed until there is no more powder left in the cup. Mix the medication with water only when you are ready to take it; do not prepare the mixture in advance. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions about how to mix or take this medication. Do not try to warm the medication by heating it in a microwave, or adding it to heated foods or liquids. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000943-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Patiromer ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, closed, and out of reach of children. Store it in either the refrigerator or at room temperature away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). If patiromer powder is stored at room temperature, dispose of it after 90 days. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
