			<Question qid="0000653-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Ivabradine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ivabradine is used to treat certain adults with heart failure (condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the other parts of the body) to decrease the risk that their condition will worsen and need to be treated in a hospital. It is also used to treat a certain type of heart failure in children 6 months of age and older due to cardiomyopathy (a condition in which the heart muscle becomes weakened and enlarged). Ivabradine is in a class of medications called hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel blockers. It works by slowing the heart rate so the heart can pump more blood through the body each time it beats.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000653-2" qtype="usage">How should Ivabradine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ivabradine comes as a tablet and as an oral solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food twice a day. Take ivabradine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ivabradine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it, or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Some ivabradine tablets come with a line down the middle. If your doctor tells you to take half a tablet, break it carefully on the line. Take half the tablet as directed, and save the other half for your next dose. Use an oral syringe (measuring device) and a medicine cup to accurately measure and take your dose of ivabradine solution. Ask your pharmacist for a medicine cup if one is not included with your medication. Your pharmacist will give you an oral syringe that works best to measure your dose. Empty all of the solution from the ampule(s) into the medication cup. Measure your dose of from the medication cup using the oral syringe. Follow the manufacturer's instructions about how to use and clean the oral syringe. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you if you have any questions. If you vomit or spit out after taking ivabradine, do not take another dose. Continue your regular dosing schedule. Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose after 2 weeks depending on how well the medication works for you, and the side effects you experience. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with ivabradine. Ivabradine controls the symptoms of heart failure but does not cure it. Continue to take ivabradine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ivabradine without talking to your doctor. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with ivabradine and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000653-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Ivabradine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Discard any unused oral solution left in the medication cup or the ampule. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
