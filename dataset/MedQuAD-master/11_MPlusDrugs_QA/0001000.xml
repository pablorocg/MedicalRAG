			<Question qid="0001000-2" qtype="usage">How should Polymyxin B and Trimethoprim Ophthalmic be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of polymyxin B and trimethoprim comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eye.

Use ophthalmic polymyxin B and trimethoprim until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better.

 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water., While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket., Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it., Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face., While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid., Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid., Close your eye and tip your head down as though looking at the floor., Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure for 2-3 minutes., Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip., Wash your hands and if necessary your child's hands after instillation to remove any medication.,  Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001000-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Polymyxin B and Trimethoprim Ophthalmic ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
