			<Question qid="0000342-2" qtype="usage">How should Desonide Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Desonide comes as a cream, ointment, gel, foam, and lotion to apply to the skin. Desonide topical is usually applied two to four times a day. Apply it at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use desonide exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply it to other areas of your body or use it to treat other skin conditions unless directed to do so by your doctor. Your skin condition should improve during the first 2 weeks of your treatment with the cream, ointment, or lotion or during the first 4 weeks of your treatment with the gel or foam.  Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during this time. Shake the lotion well before each use to mix the medication evenly. This medication is only for use on the skin. Do not let desonide topical get into your eyes, nose, or mouth and do not swallow it. Avoid use in the genital and rectal areas, and in skin creases and armpits unless directed by your doctor. To use desonide topical, apply a small amount of ointment, cream, gel, or lotion to cover the affected area of the skin with a thin even film and rub it in gently. To use desonide foam, shake well before each use, and apply a small amount of foam to cover the affected area of the skin with a thin even film and rub it in gently. To use desonide foam on your face, apply foam into your hands and gently rub the medicine into affected areas of face; do not apply desonide foam directly to your face. You should wash your hands after applying desonide foam. If you are applying desonide to a child's diaper area, do not cover the area with tight fitting diapers or plastic pants. Do not wrap or bandage the treated area unless your doctor tells you that you should. Such use may increase side effects. Desonide foam may catch fire. Stay away from open fire, flames, and do not smoke while you are applying desonide foam, and for a short time afterward.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000342-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Desonide Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Throw away any medication that is outdated or no longer needed. Talk to your pharmacist about the proper disposal of your medication. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
