			<Question qid="0000590-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Hydromorphone Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hydromorphone injection may be habit forming, especially with prolonged use, and cause slowed or stopped breathing or death if it is overused. Inject hydromorphone injection exactly as directed. Do not use more of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor, While using hydromorphone injection, discuss with your health care provider your pain treatment goals, length of treatment, and other ways to manage your pain. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family drinks or has ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, uses or has ever used street drugs, or has overused prescription medications, or has had an overdose, or if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness. There is a greater risk that you will overuse hydromorphone if you have or have ever had any of these conditions. Talk to your health care provider immediately and ask for guidance if you think that you have an opioid addiction or call the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP. Hydromorphone injection is available as a regular strength solution (Dilaudid) and a concentrated solution (Dilaudid-HP) that contains more hydromorphone in each milliliter of solution. Your doctor should only prescribe the concentrated solution if you are opioid tolerant (have been treated with certain doses of narcotic medications for at least 1 week, allowing your body to adjust to this type of medication). The concentrated solution may cause serious side effects or death if it is used by a person who is not opioid tolerant. Be sure that you know which hydromorphone solution your doctor has prescribed, and always check to be sure you are receiving the correct medication. Do not allow anyone else to use your medication. Store hydromorphone injection in a safe place so that no one else can use it accidentally or on purpose. Keep track of how much medication is left so you will know if any is missing. Taking certain medications during your treatment with hydromorphone injection may increase the risk that you will develop serious, life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma. Tell your doctor if you are taking or plan to take any of the following medications: benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (Xanax), chlordiazepoxide (Librium, in Librax), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Diastat, Valium), estazolam, flurazepam, lorazepam (Ativan), oxazepam, temazepam (Restoril), and triazolam (Halcion); medications for mental illness or nausea; muscle relaxants; other narcotic pain medications; sedatives; sleeping pills; or tranquilizers. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications and will monitor you carefully. If you use hydromorphone injection with any of these medications and you develop any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care: unusual dizziness, lightheadedness, extreme sleepiness, slowed or difficult breathing, or unresponsiveness. Be sure that your caregiver or family members know which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor or emergency medical care if you are unable to seek treatment on your own. Drinking alcohol, taking prescription or nonprescription medications that contain alcohol, or using street drugs during your treatment with hydromorphone injection increases the risk that you will experience serious, life-threatening side effects. Do not drink alcohol, take prescription or nonprescription medications that contain alcohol, or use street drugs during your treatment. Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving hydromorphone injection.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000590-3" qtype="usage">How should Hydromorphone Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hydromorphone injection comes as a solution (liquid) to inject under the skin, into a vein, or into a muscle. It is usually injected once every 2 to 3 hours as needed.

Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment with hydromorphone injection. If you have used hydromorphone injection for longer than a few days, do not stop using it suddenly. If you suddenly stop using hydromorphone injection, you may experience withdrawal symptoms including restlessness; teary eyes; runny nose; yawning; sweating; chills; muscle, back or joint pain; widening of the pupils; irritability; anxiety; weakness; stomach cramps; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; nausea; loss of appetite; vomiting; diarrhea; fast breathing; or fast heartbeat.

			<Question qid="0000590-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Hydromorphone Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Your healthcare provider will tell you how to store your medication. Store your medication only as directed. Make sure you understand how to store your medication properly. Throw away any medication that is outdated or no longer needed. Talk to your healthcare provider about the proper disposal of your medication. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000590-10" qtype="emergency or overdose">What to do in case of emergency or overdose of Hydromorphone Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>In case of overdose, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222. Information is also available online at  https://www.poisonhelp.org/help . If the victim has collapsed, had a seizure, has trouble breathing, or can't be awakened, immediately call emergency services at 911. While using hydromorphone, you should talk to your doctor about having a rescue medication called naloxone readily available (e.g., home, office). Naloxone is used to reverse the life-threatening effects of an overdose. It works by blocking the effects of opiates to relieve dangerous symptoms caused by high levels of opiates in the blood. Your doctor may also prescribe you naloxone if you are living in a household where there are small children or someone who has abused street or prescription drugs. You should make sure that you and your family members, caregivers, or the people who spend time with you know how to recognize an overdose, how to use naloxone, and what to do until emergency medical help arrives. Your doctor or pharmacist will show you and your family members how to use the medication. Ask your pharmacist for the instructions or visit the manufacturer's website to get the instructions. If symptoms of an overdose occur, a friend or family member should give the first dose of naloxone, call 911 immediately, and stay with you and watch you closely until emergency medical help arrives. Your symptoms may return within a few minutes after you receive naloxone. If your symptoms return, the person should give you another dose of naloxone. Additional doses may be given every 2 to 3 minutes, if symptoms return before medical help arrives. Symptoms of overdose may include the following:
 slow or shallow breathing, difficulty breathing, sleepiness, unable to respond or wake up, muscle weakness, cold, clammy skin, narrowing or widening of the pupils (dark circle in the middle of the eye), slowed or stopped heartbeat, dizziness, fainting, snoring, </Answer>
