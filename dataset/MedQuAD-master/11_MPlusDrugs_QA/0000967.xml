			<Question qid="0000967-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Pentoxifylline and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pentoxifylline is used to improve blood flow in patients with circulation problems to reduce aching, cramping, and tiredness in the hands and feet. It works by decreasing the thickness (viscosity) of blood. This change allows your blood to flow more easily, especially in the small blood vessels of the hands and feet. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000967-2" qtype="usage">How should Pentoxifylline be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Pentoxifylline comes as an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken three times a day. Do not break, crush, or chew the tablets; swallow them whole. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take pentoxifylline exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Although you may feel the effects of this medication in 2-4 weeks, you may need to take it for up to 8 weeks before you feel the full effect of pentoxifylline. Pentoxifylline controls the symptoms of circulation problems, but does not cure them. Continue to take pentoxifylline even if you feel well. Do not stop taking pentoxifylline without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000967-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Pentoxifylline ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
