			<Question qid="0000563-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Granisetron Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Granisetron immediate-release injection is used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy and to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting that may occur after surgery. Granisetron extended-release (long-acting) injection is used with other medications to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy that may occur immediately or several days after receiving chemotherapy medications. Granisetron is in a class of medications called 5-HT 3  receptor antagonists. It works by blocking serotonin, a natural substance in the body that causes nausea and vomiting.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000563-2" qtype="usage">How should Granisetron Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
