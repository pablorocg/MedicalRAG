			<Question qid="0000498-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Filgrastim, Filgrastim-sndz, Tbo-filgrastim Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Filgrastim injection products (Granix, Neupogen, Nivestym, Releuko, Zarxio) are used to decrease the chance of infection in people who have non myeloid cancer (cancer that does not involve the bone marrow) and are receiving chemotherapy medications that may decrease the number of neutrophils (a type of blood cell needed to fight infection). Filgrastim injection products (Neupogen, Nivestym, Releuko, Zarxio) are also used to help increase the number of white blood cells, and decrease the length of time with fever in people with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; a type of cancer of the white blood cells) who are receiving treatment with chemotherapy medications. Filgrastim injection products (Neupogen, Nivestym, Releuko, Zarxio) are also used in people who are undergoing bone marrow transplants and in people who have severe chronic neutropenia (condition in which there are a low number of neutrophils in the blood). Filgrastim injection products (Neupogen, Nivestym, Zarxio) are also used to prepare the blood for leukapheresis (a treatment in which certain blood cells are removed from the body. Filgrastim injection (Neupogen) is also used to increase the chance of survival in people who have been exposed to harmful amounts of radiation, which can cause severe and life-threatening damage to your bone marrow. Filgrastim is in a class of medications called colony-stimulating factors. It works by helping the body make more neutrophils.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000498-2" qtype="usage">How should Filgrastim, Filgrastim-sndz, Tbo-filgrastim Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Filgrastim injection products come as a solution (liquid) in vials and prefilled syringes to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin) or to be slowly or continuously injected intravenously (into a vein). It is usually given once a day, but filgrastim injection products (Neupogen, Nivestym, Releuko, Zarxio) may be given twice a day when it is used to treat severe chronic neutropenia. The length of your treatment depends on the condition that you have and how well your body responds to the medication. If you are using filgrastim injection products to decrease the risk of infection, decrease the time with fever, or increase the number of white blood cells during chemotherapy, you will receive your first dose of the medication at least 24 hours after you receive a dose of chemotherapy, and will continue to receive the medication every day for up to 2 weeks or until your blood cell counts return to normal. If you are using filgrastim injection products to decrease the risk of infection during a bone marrow transplant, you will receive the medication at least 24 hours after you receive chemotherapy and at least 24 hours after the bone marrow is infused. If you are using filgrastim injection products to prepare your blood for leukapheresis, you will receive your first dose at least 4 days before the first leukapheresis and will continue to receive the medication until the last leukapheresis. If you are using filgrastim injection products to treat severe chronic neutropenia, you may need to use the medication for a long period of time. If you are using filgrastim injection because you have been exposed to harmful amounts of radiation, your doctor will monitor you carefully and the length of your treatment will depend on how well your body responds to the medication. Do not stop using filgrastim injection products without talking to your doctor. Filgrastim injection products may be given to you by a nurse or other healthcare provider, or you may be told to inject the medication under the skin at home.

			<Question qid="0000498-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Filgrastim, Filgrastim-sndz, Tbo-filgrastim Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store filgrastim injection products in the refrigerator. If you accidentally freeze filgrastim (Neupogen, Nivestym, Zarxio), you may allow it to thaw in the refrigerator. However, if you freeze the same syringe or vial of filgrastim a second time, you should dispose of that syringe or vial. Filgrastim (Neupogen, Nivestym, Releuko, Zarxio) may be kept at room temperature for up to 24 hours but should be kept away from direct sunlight. Filgrastim (Granix) can be removed and returned to the refrigerator, but should not be out of the refrigerator for a total time of up to 5 days and should be protected from light. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
