			<Question qid="0000003-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Abiraterone ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).
