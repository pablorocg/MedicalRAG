			<Question qid="0001239-2" qtype="usage">How should Tranexamic Acid be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tranexamic acid comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food three times a day for up to 5 days during monthly menstruation. You should begin taking this medication each month when your period starts. Do not take tranexamic acid when you do not have a period. Take tranexamic acid at around the same times every day you are to receive a dose. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tranexamic acid exactly as directed. Do not take tranexamic acid tablets for more than 5 days in a menstrual cycle or take more than 6 tablets in a 24 hour period of time. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Tranexamic acid is used to decrease the amount of blood lost during your monthly period but does not stop menstrual bleeding. Call your doctor if your bleeding does not improve or gets worse during your treatment. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001239-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Tranexamic Acid ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
