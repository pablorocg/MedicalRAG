			<Question qid="0000679-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Lapatinib and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lapatinib is used with capecitabine (Xeloda) to treat a certain type of advanced breast cancer in people who have already been treated with other chemotherapy medications. Lapatinib is also used with letrozole (Femara) to treat a certain type of breast cancer in postmenopausal women (women who have experienced a change of life; end of menstrual periods) that has spread to other parts of the body. Lapatinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop or slow the spread of cancer cells.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000679-3" qtype="usage">How should Lapatinib be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lapatinib comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day, at least 1 hour before or 1 hour after a meal. When lapatinib is used to treat advanced or metastatic breast cancer, it is usually given once daily on days 1 to 21 (along with capecitabine on days 1 to 14) of a 21-day cycle. The cycle may be repeated as recommended by your doctor. When lapatinib is used to treat breast cancer in postmenopausal women, it is usually given once daily along with letrozole. Take all of the lapatinib tablets for your daily dose at one time each day; do not divide the tablets to take as separate doses. Take lapatinib at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take lapatinib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Your doctor may gradually increase or decrease your dose of lapatinib during your treatment. This depends on how well the medication works for you and any side effects you may experience. Continue to take lapatinib even if you feel well. Do not stop taking lapatinib without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000679-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Lapatinib ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
