			<Question qid="0000002-2" qtype="usage">How should Abatacept Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Abatacept comes as a powder to be mixed with sterile water to be given intravenously (into a vein) and as a solution (liquid) in a prefilled syringe or an autoinjector to be given subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually given by a doctor or nurse in a doctor's office or healthcare facility when given intravenously. It also my be given subcutaneously by a doctor or nurse or you or a caregiver may be told to inject the medication subcutaneously at home. When abatacept is given intravenously to treat rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis, it is usually given every 2 weeks for the first 3 doses and then every 4 weeks for as long as treatment continues. When abatacept is given intravenously to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 6 years and older, it is usually given every two weeks for the first two doses and then every four weeks for as long as treatment continues. If you are receiving abatacept intravenously to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 6 years of age and older, it will take about 30 minutes for you to receive your entire dose. When abatacept is given subcutaneously to treat rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis in adults and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 2 years and older, it is usually given once weekly. When abatacept is given intravenously to prevent graft versus host disease, it is usually injected slowly over 60 minutes on the day before hematopoietic stem-cell transplant and then on days 5, 14, and 28 after the transplant. If you will be injecting abatacept injection by yourself at home or having a friend or relative inject the medication for you, ask your doctor to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it. You and the person who will be injecting the medication should also read the manufacturer's written instructions for use that come with the medication. Before you open the package containing your medication, check to be sure that the expiration date printed on the package has not passed. After you open the package, look closely at the liquid in the syringe. The liquid should be clear or pale yellow and should not contain large, colored particles. Call your pharmacist, if there are any problems with the package or the syringe. Do not inject the medication. You may inject abatacept injection anywhere on your stomach or thighs except your navel (belly button) and the area 2 inches around it. If someone else will be injecting the medication for you, that person can also inject it into the outer area of your upper arm. Use a different spot for each injection. Do not inject abatacept injection into a spot that is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Also, do not inject into areas with scars or stretch marks. Remove the prefilled syringe or prefilled autoinjector from the refrigerator and allow it to warm to room temperature for 30 minutes before using it. Do not warm abatacept injection in hot water, microwave, or place it in sunlight. Do not remove the needle cover while allowing the prefilled syringe to reach room temperature. Your doctor will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet to read before you receive each dose of abatacept.
