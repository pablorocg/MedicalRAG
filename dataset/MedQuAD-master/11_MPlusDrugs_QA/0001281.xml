			<Question qid="0001281-2" qtype="usage">How should Vedolizumab Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Vedolizumab injection comes as a powder to be mixed with sterile water and injected intravenously (into a vein) over 30 minutes by a doctor or nurse. It is usually given in a doctor's office once every 2 to 8 weeks, more often in the beginning of your treatment and less often as your treatment continues. Vedolizumab injection also comes as a prefilled syringe and prefilled pen to be given subcutaneously (under the skin). Your doctor may switch you from intravenous to subcutaneous injection at 6 weeks after 2 previous doses of intravenous vedolizumab given at weeks 0 and 2. It is usually given every 2 weeks when given subcutaneously. Vedolizumab injection (intravenous) may cause serious allergic reactions during an infusion and for several hours afterward. A doctor or nurse will monitor you during this time to be sure you are not having a serious reaction to the medication. You may be given other medications to treat reactions to vedolizumab injection. Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms during or after your infusion: rash; itching; swelling of the face, eyes, mouth, throat, tongue, or lips; difficulty breathing or swallowing; wheezing, flushing; dizziness; feeling hot; or a fast or racing heartbeat. Vedolizumab injection can be given subcutaneously at home by patients or caregivers trained on subcutaneous technique. Always look at vedolizumab prefilled syringe or pen before injecting it. Check that the expiration date has not passed and that the liquid is clear and colorless or slightly yellow. The liquid should not contain visible particles. Do not use a dosing pen or syringe if it is expired, appears damaged, or if the liquid is cloudy, discolored, or contains particles. You can inject vedolizumab injection anywhere on front of your thighs (upper leg) or abdomen (stomach) except your navel and the area 2 inches (5 centimeters) around it. If someone else is giving you the injection, that person can also inject the medication into your upper, outer arms.  Use a different site for each injection to reduce the chances of soreness or redness. Do not inject into an area where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard or where you have scars or stretch marks. Vedolizumab prefilled syringes or pens should be stored in the refrigerator. Remove the prefilled dosing pen or syringe from the refrigerator and allow it to warm to room temperature for 30 minutes before using it. Take it out of its carton, and allow it to rest on a flat surface so that it can warm to room temperature. Do not try to warm the medication by heating it in a microwave, placing it in hot water, or through any other method. Vedolizumab prefilled syringes or pens can be left at room temperature for up to 7 days. Any used syringes need to be thrown away after 7 days at room temperature. Do not remove the cap from the prefilled dosing pen while the medication is warming. You should remove the cap right before you inject the medication. Do not replace the cap after you remove it. Do not use the device if you drop it on the floor. Never shake the prefilled dosing pen. This may damage the medication. Vedolizumab injection may help control your symptoms, but it will not cure your condition. Your doctor will watch you carefully to see how well vedolizumab injection works for you. If your condition has not improved after 14 weeks, your doctor may stop treating you with vedolizumab injection. It is important to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with vedolizumab injection and each time you receive the medication. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>
