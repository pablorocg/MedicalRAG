			<Question qid="0000912-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Osimertinib and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Osimertinib is used to help prevent a certain type of non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from returning after the tumor(s) has been removed by surgery in adults. It is also used as a first treatment for a certain type of NSCLC that has spread to other parts of the body in adults. Osimertinib is also used to treat certain types of NSCLC that has spread to other parts of the body in adults who could not be treated successfully with other similar chemotherapy medications. Osimertinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop or slow the spread of cancer cells and may help shrink tumors.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000912-2" qtype="usage">How should Osimertinib be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Osimertinib comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day. The length of your treatment depends on how well this medication works for you, and the side effects that you experience. Take osimertinib at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take osimertinib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you cannot swallow the tablets, place the tablet into 4 tablespoons (2 oz [60 mL]) of water and stir until the tablet is in small pieces. Drink the mixture right away. Pour in another half a cup (4 oz [120 mL]) to a cup of water (8 oz [240 mL]) to the container you used, rinse, and drink to make sure you get the full dose of osimertinib. Do not use carbonated water or any other liquid to dissolve the osimertinib tablet. Do not crush the tablet or heat the mixture. If you have a nasogastric (NG) tube, your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to give this mixture through an NG tube. Your doctor may temporarily or permanently stop your treatment or decrease your dose of osimertinib depending on the side effects that you experience. Be sure to talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment. Do not stop taking osimertinib without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000912-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Osimertinib ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
