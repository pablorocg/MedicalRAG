			<Question qid="0000606-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Iloperidone ?</Question>
			<Answer>Studies have shown that older adults with dementia (a brain disorder that affects the ability to remember, think clearly, communicate, and perform daily activities and that may cause changes in mood and personality) who take antipsychotics (medications for mental illness) such as iloperidone have an increased risk of death during treatment. Older adults with dementia may also have a greater chance of having a stroke or mini-stroke during treatment. Iloperidone is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of behavior problems in older adults with dementia. Talk to the doctor who prescribed this medication if you, a family member, or someone you care for has dementia and is taking iloperidone. For more information visit the FDA website:  http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm149578.htm .</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000606-3" qtype="usage">How should Iloperidone be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Iloperidone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food twice a day. Take iloperidone at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take iloperidone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of iloperidone and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every day for the first 7 days. Your doctor will also need to start you on a low dose of iloperidone and gradually increase your dose if you do not take iloperidone for 3 days or longer at any time during your treatment. Iloperidone may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. It may take up to 2 weeks or longer before iloperidone begins to control your symptoms. Continue to take iloperidone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking iloperidone without talking to your doctor. </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000606-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Iloperidone ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
