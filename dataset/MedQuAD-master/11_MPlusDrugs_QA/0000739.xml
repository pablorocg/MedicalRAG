			<Question qid="0000739-3" qtype="usage">How should Mebendazole be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Mebendazole comes as a chewable tablet. When mebendazole (Emverm) is used to treat whipworm, roundworm, and hookworm it is usually taken twice a day, in the morning and evening, for 3 days. When mebendazole (Emverm) is used to treat pinworm, it is usually taken as a single (one-time) dose. Mebendazole (Vermox) is usually taken as a single (one-time) dose. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take mebendazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you are taking mebendazole (Emverm) chewable tablets, you may chew the tablets, swallow them whole, or crush and mix them with food. You should thoroughly chew mebendazole (Vermox) chewable tablets; do not swallow the tablet whole. However, if you cannot chew the tablet, you may place the tablet on a spoon and add a small amount of water (2 to 3 mL) onto the tablet using a dosing syringe. After 2 minutes, the tablet will absorb the water and become a soft mass that should be swallowed. If your condition does not improve or gets worse, call your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000739-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Mebendazole ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
