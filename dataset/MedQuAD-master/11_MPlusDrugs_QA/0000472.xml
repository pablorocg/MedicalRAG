			<Question qid="0000472-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Etravirine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Etravirine is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults and children 2 years of age and older who no longer benefit from taking other HIV medications. Etravirine is in a class of medications called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although etravirine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000472-2" qtype="usage">How should Etravirine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Etravirine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken after a meal two times a day. Take etravirine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take etravirine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole with liquid, such as water; do not split, chew, or crush them. If you have trouble swallowing the tablets, they may be dissolved in water. To prepare, add the tablets to one teaspoon (5 mL) of water (only water, do not use any other type of liquid) or at least enough liquid to cover the medication, and stir until a milky mixture occurs. Then add one tablespoon (15 mL) of a liquid such as water or you can use a beverage such as orange juice or milk to improve the taste. Do  not  mix the tablets with a warm or hot liquid or a carbonated beverage such as a soda. Drink the mixture right away. Rinse the glass with water, orange juice, or milk and swallow the entire contents. Repeat process of rinsing and swallowing the rinse mixture several times to make sure that the entire dose is taken. Etravirine helps to control HIV infection but does not cure it. Continue to take etravirine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking etravirine without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking etravirine or miss doses, your condition may become more difficult to treat. When your supply of etravirine starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000472-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Etravirine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Keep the three desiccant (drying agent) pouches in the bottle of medication to keep the tablets dry. Do not eat the desiccant pouches. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
