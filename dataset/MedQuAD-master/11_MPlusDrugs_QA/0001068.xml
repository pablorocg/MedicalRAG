			<Question qid="0001068-2" qtype="usage">How should Riluzole be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Riluzole comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It also comes as an oral film to be dissolved on the tongue.

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take riluzole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Shake the suspension well (at least 30 seconds) before each use to mix the medication evenly. Be sure to turn the bottle up and down until you do not see clear liquid at the top or any particles at the bottom of the bottle. Read the instructions for use before you start taking riluzole suspension. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your pharmacist if you have any questions. To use the oral film follow these steps:
 Wash your hands and make sure your hands are completely dry before handling the film., Remove riluzole oral film from the foil patch and place on the top of the tongue., Close mouth and swallow saliva normally while allowing riluzole oral film to dissolve.

Continue to take riluzole even if you feel well. Do not stop taking riluzole without talking to your doctor.

			<Question qid="0001068-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Riluzole ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature, away from light and excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze the suspension. Be sure to store the suspension bottle upright. Be sure to use the suspension within 15 days of opening the bottle and discard any remaining medication after 15 days. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
