			<Question qid="0000592-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Hydroxychloroquine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hydroxychloroquine is used to prevent and treat acute attacks of malaria in adults and children weighing more than 31 kg (68 lbs). It is also used to treat discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE; a chronic inflammatory condition of the skin) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus; an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks healthy parts of the body such as joints, skin, blood vessels, and organs) and rheumatoid arthritis. Hydroxychloroquine is in a class of drugs called antimalarials and is also an antirheumatic drug. It works by killing the organisms that cause malaria. Hydroxychloroquine may work to treat rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus by decreasing the activity of the immune system.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000592-2" qtype="usage">How should Hydroxychloroquine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hydroxychloroquine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. Hydroxychloroquine tablets should be taken with food or milk. If you are taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent malaria, one dose is usually taken once a week on exactly the same day of each week. You will begin treatment 1 to 2 weeks before you travel to an area where malaria is common and then continue during your time in the area and for 4 weeks after you return. If you are taking hydroxychloroquine to treat malaria, the first dose is usually taken right away, followed by another dose 6 hours later and then 2 additional doses, 24 and 48 hours after the first dose. If you are taking hydroxychloroquine to treat lupus erythematosus (DLE or SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis, it is usually taken once or twice a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take hydroxychloroquine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If you are taking hydroxychloroquine for symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, your symptoms should improve within several weeks to months. If your rheumatoid arthritis symptoms do not improve, or if they worsen, call your doctor. Once you and your doctor are sure the drug works for you, do not stop taking hydroxychloroquine without talking to your doctor. Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis will return if you stop taking hydroxychloroquine.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000592-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Hydroxychloroquine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
