			<Question qid="0000720-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Lopinavir and Ritonavir and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of lopinavir and ritonavir is used with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Lopinavir and ritonavir are in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. They work by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. When lopinavir and ritonavir are taken together, ritonavir also helps to increase the amount of lopinavir in the body so that the medication will have a greater effect. Although lopinavir and ritonavir will not cure HIV, these medications may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000720-2" qtype="usage">How should Lopinavir and Ritonavir be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of lopinavir and ritonavir comes as a tablet and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day, but may be taken once a day by certain adults. The solution must be taken with food. The tablets may be taken with or without food. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take lopinavir and ritonavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If you are using the solution, shake it well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use a dose-measuring spoon or cup to measure the correct amount of liquid for each dose, not a regular household spoon. Continue to take lopinavir and ritonavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking lopinavir and ritonavir without talking to your doctor. If you miss doses, take less than the prescribed amount, or stop taking lopinavir and ritonavir, your condition may become more difficult to treat.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000720-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Lopinavir and Ritonavir ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store the tablets at room temperature and protect them from excess moisture. It is best to keep the tablets in the container they came in; if you must take them out of the container, you should use them within 2 weeks. You may keep the oral solution in the refrigerator until the expiration date printed on the label, or you may store it at room temperature for up to 2 months. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
