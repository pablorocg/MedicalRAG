			<Question qid="0001187-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Testosterone Buccal and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Testosterone buccal systems are used to treat symptoms of low testosterone in adult men who have hypogonadism (a condition in which the body does not produce enough natural testosterone). Testosterone is used only for men with low testosterone levels caused by certain medical conditions, including disorders of the testicles, pituitary gland, (a small gland in the brain), or hypothalamus (a part of the brain) that cause hypogonadism. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your testosterone levels to see if they are low before you begin to use testosterone buccal. Testosterone should not be used treat the symptoms of low testosterone in men who have low testosterone due to aging ('age-related hypogonadism'). Testosterone is in a class of medications called androgenic hormones. Testosterone is a hormone produced by the body that contributes to the growth, development, and functioning of the male sexual organs and typical male characteristics. Testosterone buccal systems work by replacing testosterone that is normally produced by the body.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001187-2" qtype="usage">How should Testosterone Buccal be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Buccal testosterone comes as a system (tablet shaped patch) to apply to the upper gum. It is usually applied twice a day around every 12 hours. To help you remember to apply testosterone buccal systems, apply them at about the same times each day. It may be convenient to apply the systems after you eat breakfast and brush your teeth, and after dinner. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Apply testosterone buccal systems exactly as directed. Do not apply more or fewer systems or apply the systems more often than prescribed by your doctor. You should apply testosterone buccal systems to the areas of your upper gum that are above the left and right incisors (the teeth just to the left and right of the two front teeth). Alternate sides at every dose so that you never apply a system to the same side two doses in a row. Testosterone buccal systems only work when applied to the upper gum. Although the systems look like tablets, you should not chew or swallow them. Testosterone buccal systems will soften and mold to the shape of your gum and will gradually release medication. However, they will not dissolve completely in your mouth and must be removed after 12 hours. You may brush your teeth; use mouthwash; use tobacco products; chew gum; eat; and drink alcoholic or nonalcoholic beverages while you are wearing a testosterone buccal system. However, these activities may cause the system to fall off your gum. After you are finished the activity, check to be sure the system is still in place. If your testosterone buccal system does not stick or falls off within 8 hours after you apply it, replace it with a new system immediately and apply your next dose at the regularly scheduled time. If your system falls off more than 8 hours after you apply it, apply a new system immediately and do not apply a new system at the regularly scheduled time. The replacement system will take the place of your next dose. Your doctor may adjust your dose of testosterone depending on the amount of testosterone in your blood during your treatment. Testosterone buccal systems may control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to use testosterone even if you feel well. Do not stop using testosterone without talking to your doctor. If you stop using testosterone, your symptoms may return. To apply testosterone buccal systems, follow these steps:
 Push one system out through the back of the blister card. Notice that one side of the system is flat and is marked with the company logo and the other side is curved., Place the system on your fingertip with the flat side against your finger., Gently press the curved side of the system against the proper area of your upper gum. Push the system as high up on your gum as possible., Place your finger on the outside of your upper lip over the spot where you applied the testosterone buccal system. Press down on the spot for 30 seconds to help the system stick to your gum., The testosterone buccal system should now be stuck to your gum. If it is stuck to your cheek, you may leave it in place. The system will still release medication properly when stuck to your cheek.,  To remove testosterone buccal systems, follow these steps:
 Gently slide the system to the front or back of your mouth to loosen it., Slide the system down from your gum to a tooth. Be careful not to scratch your gum., Remove the system from your mouth and discard it safely, so that it is out of the reach of children and pets. Children and pets can be harmed if they chew on or play with used systems., Apply a new system following the directions above., </Answer>
