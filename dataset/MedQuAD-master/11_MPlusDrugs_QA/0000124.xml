			<Question qid="0000124-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Belatacept Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Receiving belatacept injection may increase the risk that you will develop post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD, a serious condition with rapid growth of certain white blood cells, which may develop into a type of cancer). The risk for developing PTLD is higher if you have not been exposed to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, a virus causing mononucleosis or ''mono'') or if you have cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) or have received other treatments that lower amounts of T lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) in your blood. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check for these conditions before you begin treatment with this medication. If you have not been exposed to Epstein-Barr virus, your doctor will probably not give you belatacept injection. If you experience any of the following symptoms after receiving belatacept injection, call your doctor immediately: confusion, difficulty thinking, problems with memory, changes in mood or your usual behavior, changes in the way you walk or talk, decreased strength or weakness on one side of your body, or changes in vision. Receiving belatacept injection may also increase the risk for developing cancers, including skin cancer, and serious infections, including tuberculosis (TB, a bacterial lung infection) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML, a rare, serious brain infection). If you experience any of the following symptoms after receiving belatacept, call your doctor right away: a new skin lesion or bump, or a change in the size or color of a mole, fever, sore throat, chills, cough, and other signs of infection; night sweats; tiredness that does not go away; weight loss; swollen lymph nodes; flu-like symptoms; pain in the stomach area; vomiting; diarrhea; tenderness over the area of the transplanted kidney; frequent or painful urination; blood in the urine; clumsiness; increasing weakness; personality changes; or changes in vision and speech. Belatacept injection should only be given in a medical facility under the supervision of a doctor who is experienced in treating people who have had a kidney transplant and in prescribing medications that decrease the activity of the immune system. Belatacept injection may cause rejection of the new liver or death in people who have had liver transplants. This medication should not be given to prevent rejection of liver transplants. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with belatacept injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide. Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving treatment with belatacept.</Answer>
