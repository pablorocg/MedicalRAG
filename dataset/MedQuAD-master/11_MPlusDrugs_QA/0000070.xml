			<Question qid="0000070-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Ampicillin and Sulbactam Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of ampicillin and sulbactam injection is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria, including infections of the skin, female reproductive organs, and abdomen (stomach area). Ampicillin is in a class of medications called penicillin-like antibiotics. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria. Sulbactam is in a class of medications called beta-lactamase inhibitors. It works by preventing bacteria from destroying ampicillin. Antibiotics such as ampicillin and sulbactam injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000070-2" qtype="usage">How should Ampicillin and Sulbactam Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ampicillin and sulbactam injection comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid and injected intravenously (into a vein) or intramuscularly (into a muscle) every 6 hours (4 times daily). The length of treatment depends on the type of infection you have. Your doctor will tell you how long to use ampicillin and sulbactam injection. After your condition improves, your doctor may switch you to another antibiotic that you can take by mouth to complete your treatment. You may receive ampicillin and sulbactam injection in a hospital, or you may use the medication at home. If you will be using ampicillin and sulbactam injection at home, your health care provider will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with ampicillin and sulbactam injection. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor. If you still have symptoms of infection after you finish ampicillin and sulbactam injection, tell your doctor. Use ampicillin and sulbactam injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using ampicillin and sulbactam injection too soon or if you skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>
