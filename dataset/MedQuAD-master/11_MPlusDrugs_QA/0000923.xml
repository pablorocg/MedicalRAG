			<Question qid="0000923-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Oxybutynin Transdermal Patch and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Oxybutynin transdermal patches are used to treat an overactive bladder (a condition in which the bladder muscles contract uncontrollably and cause frequent urination, urgent need to urinate, and inability to control urination). Oxybutynin is in a class of medications called antimuscarinics. It works by relaxing the bladder muscles.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000923-2" qtype="usage">How should Oxybutynin Transdermal Patch be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Transdermal oxybutynin comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is usually applied twice each week (every 3&#8211;4 days). You should apply transdermal oxybutynin on the same 2 days of the week every week. To help you remember to apply your patches on the right days, you should mark the calendar on the back of your package of medication. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use transdermal oxybutynin exactly as directed. Do not apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor. You can apply oxybutynin patches anywhere on your stomach, hips, or buttocks except the area around your waistline. Choose an area where you think the patch will be comfortable for you, where it will not be rubbed by tight clothing, and where it will be protected from sunlight by clothing. After you apply a patch to a particular area, wait at least 1 week before applying another patch in that spot. Do not apply patches to skin that has wrinkles or folds; that you have recently treated with any lotion, oil, or powder; or that is oily, cut, scraped, or irritated. Before applying a patch, be sure the skin is clean and dry. After you apply an oxybutynin patch, you should wear it all the time until you are ready to remove it and put on a fresh patch. If the patch loosens or falls off before it is time to replace it, try to press it back in place with your fingers. If the patch cannot be pressed back on, discard it and apply a fresh patch to a different area. Replace the fresh patch on your next scheduled patch change day. You may bathe, swim, shower, or exercise while you are wearing an oxybutynin patch. However, try not to rub on the patch during these activities, and do not soak in a hot tub for a long period of time while wearing a patch. Transdermal oxybutynin controls the symptoms of overactive bladder but does not cure the condition. Continue to take transdermal oxybutynin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking transdermal oxybutynin without talking to your doctor. To use the patches, follow these steps:
 Open the protective pouch and remove the patch., Peel the first piece of liner off the sticky side of the patch. A second strip of liner should remain stuck to the patch., Press the patch firmly onto your skin with the sticky side down. Be careful not to touch the sticky side with your fingers., Bend the patch in half and use your fingertips to roll the remaining part of the patch onto your skin. The second liner strip should fall off of the patch when you do this., Press firmly on the surface of the patch to attach it tightly to your skin., When you are ready to remove a patch, peel it off slowly and gently. Fold the patch in half with the sticky sides together and discard it safely, in a way that is out of reach of children and pets. Children and pets can be harmed if they chew on, play with, or wear used patches., Wash the area that was under the patch with mild soap and warm water to remove any residue. If necessary, you can use baby oil or a medical adhesive removal pad to remove residue that will not come off with soap and water. Do not use alcohol, nail polish remover, or other solvents., Apply a new patch to a different area immediately by following steps 1&#8211;5., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000923-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Oxybutynin Transdermal Patch ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store the patches in their protective pouches and do not open a pouch until you are ready to apply the patch. Store this medication at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
