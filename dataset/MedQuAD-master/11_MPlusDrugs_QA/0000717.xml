			<Question qid="0000717-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Lomitapide ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lomitapide may cause serious damage to the liver. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease or if you have ever had liver problems while taking other medications.  Your doctor may tell you not to take lomitapide. Tell your doctor if you drink alcohol. Drinking alcohol may increase the risk that you will develop liver problems. Do not drink more than one alcoholic beverage per day while you are taking lomitapide. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), amiodarone (Cordarone), doxycycline (Doryx, Vibramycin, others), isotretinoin (Accutane), methotrexate (Rheumatrex), minocycline (Dynacin, Minocin), tamoxifen (Nolvadex), or tetracycline (Sumycin). If you experience any of the following symptoms at any time during your treatment, stop taking lomitapide and call your doctor immediately: extreme tiredness, lack of energy, weakness, nausea or vomiting that gets worse or does not go away, pain in the upper right part of the stomach, loss of appetite, yellowing of the skin or eyes, fever, or flu-like symptoms. Your doctor may need to change the dose or stop or delay your treatment if you experience liver problems. A program called Juxtapid REMS &#174;  has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because of the possibility of liver damage associated with lomitapide use. All people who are prescribed lomitapide must have a lomitapide prescription from a doctor who is registered with Juxtapid REMS &#174; , and have the prescription filled at a pharmacy that is registered with Juxtapid REMS &#174;  in order to receive this medication. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests before and during your treatment to check your body's response to lomitapide. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with lomitapide and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000717-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Lomitapide and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lomitapide is used along with diet changes (restriction of cholesterol and fat intake) and other treatments to reduce the amount of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol'), total cholesterol, and other fatty substances in the blood in people that have homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH; an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Lomitapide should not be used to decrease cholesterol levels in people who do not have HoFH. Lomitapide is in a class of medications called cholesterol-lowering medications. It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats may help prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000717-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Lomitapide ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
