			<Question qid="0000044-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Alprostadil Urogenital and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Alprostadil injection and suppositories are used to treat certain types of erectile dysfunction (impotence; inability to get or keep an erection) in men. Alprostadil injection is also sometimes used in combination with other tests to diagnose erectile dysfunction. Alprostadil is in a class of medications called vasodilators. It works by relaxing the muscles and blood vessels in the penis to keep enough blood in the penis so that an erection can occur. Alprostadil does not cure erectile dysfunction or increase sexual desire. Alprostadil does not prevent pregnancy or the spread of sexually transmitted diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000044-2" qtype="usage">How should Alprostadil Urogenital be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Alprostadil comes as a powder to be mixed with the liquid provided in the package and injected into the penis and as a urethral suppository (pellet to be placed into the urinary opening of the penis). Alprostadil is used as needed before sexual activity. An erection may occur within 5 to 20 minutes after using the injection and within 5 to 10 minutes after using the pellet. The erection should last approximately 30 to 60 minutes. Alprostadil injection should not be used more than three times per week, with at least 24 hours between uses. Alprostadil pellets should not be used more than twice in a 24-hour period. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use alprostadil exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will administer the first dose of alprostadil in his or her office to determine the proper dose for you. After you begin to use alprostadil at home, your doctor may gradually increase or decrease your dose. Tell your doctor if you do not experience satisfactory erections or if your erections last for too long, but do not change your dose without talking to your doctor. You must be trained by your doctor before using alprostadil at home. Be sure that you understand exactly how to use alprostadil. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to use your medication. Needle breakage has occurred during administration of alprostadil To minimize the risk of this occurring, make sure you use the proper needle as instructed by your doctor or nurse. Make sure to always insert the appropriate needle perpendicular to the long axis of the penis. Do not reuse needles, syringes, cartridges, vials, pellets, or applicators. Dispose of used needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the container. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000044-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Alprostadil Urogenital ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store alprostadil vials and cartridges at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Read the manufacturer's instructions for information about how long alprostadil solution may be stored after mixing and where it should be kept. Alprostadil pellets should be stored in the original package in the refrigerator, but may be kept at room temperature for up to 14 days before use. Do not expose the medication to high temperatures or place it in direct sunlight since this will make it ineffective. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org When traveling, do not store alprostadil in checked luggage or leave it in the car where it may be exposed to extreme temperatures. Store alprostadil pellets in a portable ice pack or cooler. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
