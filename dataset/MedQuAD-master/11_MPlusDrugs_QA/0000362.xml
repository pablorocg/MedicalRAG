			<Question qid="0000362-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Dicloxacillin and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dicloxacillin is  used to treat infections caused by certain types of bacteria.  Dicloxacillin is in a class of medications called penicillins. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as dicloxacillin will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000362-2" qtype="usage">How should Dicloxacillin be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dicloxacillin comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken every 6 hours (four times a day).  Dicloxacillin should be taken on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal or snack,  The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection that you have. Take dicloxacillin at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take dicloxacillin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Take dicloxacillin while you are sitting or standing up with at least 4 ounces (120 mL) of water. Do not lay down or go to sleep immediately after taking dicloxacillin. Take dicloxacillin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. Do not stop taking dicloxacillin without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking dicloxacillin too soon or if you skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000362-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Dicloxacillin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medicine in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store the capsules at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
