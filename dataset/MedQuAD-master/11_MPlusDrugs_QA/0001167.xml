			<Question qid="0001167-3" qtype="indication">Who should get Telaprevir and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Telaprevir is used along with two other medications (ribavirin [Copegus, Rebetol] and peginterferon alfa [Pegasys]) to treat chronic hepatitis C (an ongoing viral infection that damages the liver) in people who have not yet been treated for this condition or whose condition could not successfully be treated with ribavirin and peginterferon alfa alone.

			<Question qid="0001167-4" qtype="usage">How should Telaprevir be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Telaprevir comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken two times a day (every 10 to 14 hours). You must eat a meal or snack that contains about 20 grams of fat within 30 minutes before you take telaprevir. Examples of foods (regular versions, not low-fat or nonfat products) that could be taken with telaprevir include: a bagel with cream cheese, 1/2 cup nuts, 3 tablespoons peanut butter, 1 cup ice cream, 2 ounces American or cheddar cheese, 2 ounces potato chips, or 1/2 cup trail mix. Ask your doctor for other examples of foods that contain 20 grams of fat that you can eat when you take telaprevir. Do not take telaprevir without food. Take telaprevir at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take telaprevir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, crush, or chew them. If you cannot swallow tablets whole, tell your doctor. Continue to take telaprevir even if you feel well. Telaprevir must be taken in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, usually for 12 weeks. Peginterferon alfa and ribavirin are usually continued after treatment with telaprevir is finished. Do not stop taking telaprevir, peginterferon alfa, or ribavirin, unless told to do so by your doctor. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with telaprevir and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001167-10" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Telaprevir ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
