			<Question qid="0000905-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about OnabotulinumtoxinA Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>OnabotulinumtoxinA injection is given as a number of tiny injections intended to affect only the specific area where injected. However, it is possible that the medication may spread from the area of injection and affect muscles in other areas of the body.  If the muscles that control breathing and swallowing are affected, you may develop severe problems breathing or swallowing that may last for several months and may cause death. If you have difficulty swallowing, you may need to be fed through a feeding tube to avoid getting food or drink into your lungs. OnabotulinumtoxinA injection may spread and cause symptoms in people of any age who are being treated for any condition, although no one has yet developed these symptoms after receiving the medication at recommended doses to treat wrinkles, eye problems, headaches, or severe underarm sweating. The risk that the medication will spread beyond the area of injection is probably highest in children being treated for spasticity (muscle stiffness and tightness) and in people, who have or have ever had swallowing problems, or breathing problems, such as asthma or emphysema; or any condition that affects muscles or nerves such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease; condition in which the nerves that control muscle movement slowly die, causing the muscles to shrink and weaken), motor neuropathy (condition in which the muscles weaken over time), myasthenia gravis (condition that causes certain muscles to weaken, especially after activity), or Lambert-Eaton syndrome (condition that causes muscle weakness that may improve with activity). Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had any of these conditions. Spread of onabotulinumtoxinA injection into untreated areas can cause other symptoms in addition to difficulty breathing or swallowing. Symptoms may occur within hours of an injection or as late as several weeks after treatment. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: loss of strength or muscle weakness all over the body; double or blurred vision; drooping eyelids or brow; difficulty swallowing or breathing; hoarseness or change or loss of voice; difficulty speaking or saying words clearly; or inability to control urination. Your doctor will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA injection and each time you receive treatment. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000905-2" qtype="indication">Who should get OnabotulinumtoxinA Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>OnabotulinumtoxinA injection (Botox, Botox Cosmetic) is used to treat a number of conditions. OnabotulinumtoxinA injection (Botox) is used to:
  relieve the symptoms of cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis; uncontrollable tightening of the neck muscles that may cause neck pain and abnormal head positions) in people 16 years of age and older;,  relieve the symptoms of strabismus (an eye muscle problem that causes the eye to turn inward or outward) and blepharospasm (uncontrollable tightening of the eyelid muscles that may cause blinking, squinting, and abnormal eyelid movements) in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older;, prevent headaches in people older than 18 years of age with chronic migraine (severe, throbbing headaches that are sometimes accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound or light) who have 15 or more days each month with headaches lasting 4 hours a day or longer;, treat overactive bladder (a condition in which the bladder muscles contract uncontrollably and cause frequent urination, urgent need to urinate, and inability to control urination) in people 18 years of age and older when other medications do not work well enough or cannot be taken;, treat neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO; a bladder control condition caused by brain, spinal cord or nerve problem) in children 5 years of age and older when other medications did not help or could not be tolerated;, treat incontinence (leakage of urine) in people 18 years of age and older with overactive bladder (condition in which the bladder muscles have uncontrollable spasms) caused by nerve problems such as spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and people may experience weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination, and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control), who cannot be treated with oral medication;, treat spasticity (muscle stiffness and tightness) of muscles in the arms and legs in adults and children 2 years of age and older;, treat severe underarm sweating in people 18 years of age and older who cannot be treated with products applied on the skin;,  and OnabotulinumtoxinA injection (Botox Cosmetic) is used to
 temporarily smooth frown lines (wrinkles between the eyebrows) in adults 18 years of age and older,, temporarily smooth crow's feet lines (wrinkles near the outer corner of the eye) in adults 18 years of age and older,, and to temporarily smooth forehead lines in adults 18 years of age and older.,  OnabotulinumtoxinA injection is in a class of medications called neurotoxins. When onabotulinumtoxinA is injected into a muscle, it blocks the nerve signals that cause uncontrollable tightening and movements of the muscle. When onabotulinumtoxinA is injected into a sweat gland, it decreases the activity of the gland to reduce sweating. When onabotulinumtoxinA is injected into the bladder, it decreases bladder contractions and blocks signals that tell the nervous system that the bladder is full.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000905-3" qtype="usage">How should OnabotulinumtoxinA Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>OnabotulinumtoxinA injection comes as a powder to be mixed with a liquid and injected into a muscle, into the skin, or into the wall of the bladder by a doctor. Your doctor will choose the best place to inject the medication in order to treat your condition. If you are receiving onabotulinumtoxinA to treat frown lines, forehead lines, crow's feet lines, cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, strabismus, spasticity, urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, or chronic migraine, you may receive additional injections every 3 to 4 months, depending on your condition and on how long the effects of the treatment last. If you are receiving onabotulinumtoxinA injection to treat severe underarm sweating or neurogenic detrusor overactivity, you may need to receive additional injections once every 6 to 7 months or as recommended by your doctor when your symptoms return. If you are receiving onabotulinumtoxinA injection to treat severe underarm sweating, your doctor will probably perform a test to find the areas that need to be treated. Your doctor will tell you how to prepare for this test. You will probably be told to shave your underarms and not to use nonprescription deodorants or antiperspirants for 24 hours before the test. If you are receiving onabotulinumtoxinA injection to treat urinary incontinence, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics for you to take for 1-3 days before your treatment, on the day of your treatment and for 1 to 3 days after your treatment. Your doctor may change your dose of onabotulinumtoxinA injection to find the dose that will work best for you. Your doctor may use an anesthetic cream, or a cold pack, to numb your skin, or eye drops to numb your eyes before injecting onabotulinumtoxinA. One brand or type of botulinum toxin cannot be substituted for another. OnabotulinumtoxinA injection may help control your condition but will not cure it. It may take a few days or up to several weeks before you feel the full benefit of onabotulinumtoxinA injection. Ask your doctor when you can expect to see improvement, and call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during the expected time.</Answer>
