			<Question qid="0000672-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Lamivudine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tell your doctor if you have or think you may have hepatitis B virus infection (HBV; an ongoing liver infection). Your doctor may test you to see if you have HBV before you begin your treatment with lamivudine. If you have HBV and you take lamivudine, your condition may suddenly worsen when you stop taking lamivudine. Your doctor will examine you and order lab tests regularly for several months after you stop taking lamivudine to see if your HBV has worsened. Epivir tablets and liquid (used to treat human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) are not interchangeable with Epivir-HBV tablets and liquid (used to treat hepatitis B infection). Epivir contains a higher dose of lamivudine than Epivir-HBV. Treatment with Epivir-HBV in patients infected with HIV may cause the HIV virus to be less treatable with lamivudine and other medicines. If you have both HIV and hepatitis B, you should take only Epivir. If you are taking Epivir-HBV for hepatitis B infection, talk to your doctor about your risks for HIV infection. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests to check your body's response to lamivudine. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking lamivudine.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000672-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Lamivudine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lamivudine (Epivir) is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults and children 3 months of age and older. Lamivudine (Epivir-HBV) is used to treat hepatitis B infection. Lamivudine is in a class of medications called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV and hepatitis B in the blood. Although lamivudine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV or hepatitis B virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000672-3" qtype="usage">How should Lamivudine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lamivudine comes as a tablet and oral solution (liquid) to take by mouth. Lamivudine (Epivir) is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food. Lamivudine (Epivir-HBV) is usually taken once a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take lamivudine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Lamivudine controls HIV and hepatitis B infection and but does not cure them. Continue to take lamivudine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking lamivudine without talking to your doctor. When your supply of lamivudine starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. If you miss doses or stop taking lamivudine, your condition may become more difficult to treat.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000672-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Lamivudine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). The oral solution does not need to be refrigerated; however, it should be stored in a cool place. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
