			<Question qid="0001171-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Telmisartan and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Telmisartan is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Telmisartan is also used to decrease the chance of heart attack, stroke, or death in people 55 years of age or older who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Telmisartan is in a class of medications called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances that tighten the blood vessels, allowing the blood to flow more smoothly and the heart to pump more efficiently. High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001171-3" qtype="usage">How should Telmisartan be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Telmisartan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. To help you remember to take telmisartan, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take telmisartan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Telmisartan tablets come in individual blister packs that can be opened by peeling back the paper layer from the foil and pushing the tablet through the foil. Do not open a blister pack until you are ready to swallow the tablet it contains. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of telmisartan and gradually increase your dose. Telmisartan controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Your blood pressure may decrease during the first 2 weeks of your treatment, but it may take 4 weeks for you to notice the full benefit of telmisartan. Continue to take telmisartan even if you feel well. Do not stop taking telmisartan without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001171-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Telmisartan ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the blister pack it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
