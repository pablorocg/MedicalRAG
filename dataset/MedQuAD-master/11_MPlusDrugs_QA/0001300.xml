			<Question qid="0001300-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Zaleplon and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Zaleplon is used on a short-term basis to treat insomnia (difficulty falling asleep). Zaleplon does not help you to stay asleep longer or decrease the number of times that you awaken during the night. Zaleplon is in a class of medications called hypnotics. It works by slowing activity in the brain to allow sleep.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001300-2" qtype="usage">How should Zaleplon be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Zaleplon comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken as needed at bedtime or after trying unsuccessfully to fall asleep. Do not take zaleplon with or shortly after a heavy, high-fat meal. Zaleplon may not work well if it is taken with high fat foods. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take zaleplon exactly as directed. You will probably become very sleepy soon after you take zaleplon and will remain sleepy for some time after you take the medication. Plan to go to bed right after you take zaleplon and to stay in bed for 7 to 8 hours. Do not take zaleplon if you will be unable to go to bed right away and remain asleep for 7 to 8 hours after taking the medication. If you continue to walk around after taking zaleplon, you may experience dizziness, lightheadedness, problems with memory and coordination, or hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist). If you get up too soon after taking zaleplon, you may experience memory problems. You should be sleeping well within 7 to 10 days after you start taking zaleplon. Call your doctor if your sleep problems do not improve during this time, if they get worse at any time during your treatment, or if you notice any changes in your thoughts or behavior. Zaleplon can be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking zaleplon without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking zaleplon, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as unpleasant feelings, stomach and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, shakiness, and rarely, seizures. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. You may have more difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep on the first few nights after you stop taking zaleplon than you did before you started taking the medication. This is normal and usually gets better without treatment after one or two nights. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with zaleplon and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001300-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Zaleplon ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Keep zaleplon in a safe place so no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Keep track of how many capsules are left so you will know if any are missing. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
