			<Question qid="0000073-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Anagrelide and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Anagrelide is used to decrease the number of platelets (a type of blood cell that is needed to control bleeding) in the blood of patients who have a bone marrow disorder, in which the body makes too many of one or more types of blood cells, such as essential thrombocythemia (condition in which the body makes too many platelets) or polycythemia vera (condition in which the body makes too many red blood cells and sometimes too many platelets). Anagrelide is in a class of medications called platelet-reducing agents. It works by slowing the production of platelets in the body.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000073-2" qtype="usage">How should Anagrelide be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Anagrelide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food two to four times a day. Take anagrelide at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take anagrelide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of anagrelide and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once a week. Your doctor may change your dose during your treatment based upon your body's response to the medication. Follow these directions carefully. Anagrelide may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take anagrelide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking anagrelide without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking anagrelide, the number of platelets in your blood will increase and you may experience symptoms.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000073-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Anagrelide ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light or excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
