			<Question qid="0000658-2" qtype="usage">How should Ixazomib be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ixazomib comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with water on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating. It is taken on days 1,8, and 15 of a 28 day treatment cycle. Take ixazomib at around the same time on every day that you take it. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ixazomib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not take ixazomib and dexamethasone at the same time because you should take dexamethasone with food. Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Be careful when handling ixazomib capsules. Do not allow your skin, eyes, mouth, or nose to come into contact with broken or crushed ixazomib capsules. If such contact occurs, wash your skin well with soap and water or rinse your eyes well with plain water. If you vomit after taking ixazomib, do not repeat the dose. Take your next dose of ixazomib on the next scheduled day that you are supposed to take it. Your doctor may need to temporarily or permanently stop your treatment or decrease your dose of ixazomib, or of the other medications that you are taking, depending on the side effects that you experience. Be sure to talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment. Do not stop taking ixazomib without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000658-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Ixazomib ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Leave the medication in the original packaging until right before you take it. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
