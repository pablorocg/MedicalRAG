			<Question qid="0000437-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Eprosartan and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Eprosartan is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Eprosartan is in a class of medications called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances that tighten the blood vessels, allowing the blood to flow more smoothly and the heart to pump more efficiently. High blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000437-3" qtype="usage">How should Eprosartan be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Eprosartan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food. To help you remember to take eprosartan, take it at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take eprosartan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Eprosartan controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Your blood pressure may decrease during the first 2 weeks of your treatment, but it may take 2 to 3 weeks for you to notice the full benefit of eprosartan. Continue to take eprosartan even if you feel well. Do not stop taking eprosartan without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000437-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Eprosartan ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
