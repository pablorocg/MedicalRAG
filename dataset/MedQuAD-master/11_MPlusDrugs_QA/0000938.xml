If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: stomach cramps; loose stools; diarrhea; vomiting; or dry mouth, dark urine, decreased sweating, dry skin, and other signs of dehydration. Talk to your doctor about what you should do if you develop diarrhea during your treatment with panobinostat.

Your doctor will order tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG; test that records the electrical activity of the heart) before and during your treatment to see if it is safe for you to take panobinostat. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: chest pain, rapid, pounding, or irregular heart beat, lightheadedness, feeling faint, dizziness, blue-colored lips, shortness of breath, or swelling of the hands, arms, feet, ankles, or lower legs. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests to check your body's response to panobinostat. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with panobinostat and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.

			<Question qid="0000938-3" qtype="usage">How should Panobinostat be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Panobinostat comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once daily on certain days of a 21-day cycle. The cycle may be repeated for up to 16 cycles. Take panobinostat at around the same time on each scheduled day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take panobinostat exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the capsules whole with a glass of water; do not crush, chew, or open them. Handle the capsules as little as possible. If you touch a broken panobinostat capsule or the medicine in the capsule, wash that area of your body with soap and water. If the medicine in the capsule gets into your mouth, nose, or eyes, wash it away with plenty of water. If you vomit after taking panobinostat, do not take another dose. Continue your regular dosing schedule. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment. Your doctor may decrease your dose of panobinostat or stop your treatment for a while or permanently, if you experience side effects of the medication.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000938-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Panobinostat ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
