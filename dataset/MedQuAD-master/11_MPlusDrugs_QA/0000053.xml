			<Question qid="0000053-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Amiloride and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Amiloride is usually used in combination with other diuretics ('water pills') to treat high blood pressure and heart failure in patients who have low amounts of potassium in their bodies or for whom low potassium levels in the body could be dangerous. Amiloride is in a class of medications called diuretics. It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine, but reduces the loss of potassium. High blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000053-2" qtype="usage">How should Amiloride be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Amiloride comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day with food. To help you remember to take amiloride, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take amiloride exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. This medication controls high blood pressure and heart failure but does not cure these conditions. Continue to take amiloride even if you feel well. Do not stop taking amiloride without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000053-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Amiloride ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
