			<Question qid="0000731-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Lurasidone ?</Question>
			<Answer>Important warning for older adults with dementia: Studies have shown that older adults with dementia (a brain disorder that affects the ability to remember, think clearly, communicate, and perform daily activities and that may cause changes in mood and personality) who take antipsychotics (medications for mental illness) such as lurasidone have an increased chance of death during treatment. Older adults with dementia may also have a greater chance of having a stroke or ministroke during treatment with antipsychotics. Lurasidone is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of behavior disorders in older adults with dementia. Talk to the doctor who prescribed this medication if you, a family member, or someone you care for has dementia and is taking lurasidone. For more information visit the FDA website:  http://www.fda.gov/Drugs Important warning for people who have depression: A small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took medications for depression during clinical studies became suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions. However, experts are not sure about how great this risk is and how much it should be considered in deciding whether a child or teenager should take an antidepressant. Children younger than 10 years of age should not normally take lurasidone to treat depression, but in some cases, a doctor may decide that lurasidone is the best medication to treat a child's condition. You should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take lurasidone to treat depression or other mental illness even if you are an adult over 24 years of age. You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and frenzied abnormal excitement. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own. Your healthcare provider will want to see you often while you are taking lurasidone, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Be sure to keep all appointments for office visits with your doctor. No matter what your age, before you take an antidepressant, you, your family, or your caregiver should talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of treating your condition with an antidepressant or with other treatments. You should also talk about the risks and benefits of not treating your condition. You should know that having depression or another mental illness greatly increases the risk that you will become suicidal. This risk is higher if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had bipolar disorder (mood that changes from depressed to abnormally excited) or mania or has thought about or attempted suicide. Talk to your doctor about your condition, symptoms, and personal and family medical history. You and your doctor will decide what type of treatment is right for you.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000731-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Lurasidone and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lurasidone is used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia (a mental illness that causes disturbed or unusual thinking, loss of interest in life, and strong or inappropriate emotions) in adults and children 13 years of age and older. It is also used to treat depression in adults and children 10 years of age and older with bipolar disorder (manic depressive disorder; a disease that causes episodes of depression, episodes of mania, and other abnormal moods). Lurasidone is also used along with lithium (Lithobid) or valproate (Depacon) to treat depression in adults with bipolar disorder. Lurasidone is in a class of medications called atypical antipsychotics. It works by changing the activity of certain natural substances in the brain.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000731-3" qtype="usage">How should Lurasidone be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Lurasidone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with a meal (at least 350 calories) once a day. Take lurasidone at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take lurasidone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Lurasidone controls schizophrenia and depression in people with bipolar disorder but it does not cure these conditions. It may take several weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of lurasidone. Continue to take lurasidone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking lurasidone without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000731-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Lurasidone ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
