			<Question qid="0000072-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Ampicillin Oral and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ampicillin is used to treat certain infections that are caused by bacteria such as meningitis (infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord); and infections of the throat, sinuses, lungs, reproductive organs, urinary tract, and gastrointestinal tract. Ampicillin is in a class of medications called penicillins. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as ampicillin will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000072-2" qtype="usage">How should Ampicillin Oral be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ampicillin comes as a capsule and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken three to four times a day, either half an hour before or two hours after meals. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection that you have. Take ampicillin at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ampicillin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly. The medication should be taken with a full glass of water. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with ampicillin. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Take ampicillin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking ampicillin too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000072-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Ampicillin Oral ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store the capsules at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Keep the suspension in the refrigerator, tightly closed, and dispose of any unused suspension after 14 days. Do not freeze. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000072-9" qtype="other information">What other information should I know about Ampicillin Oral ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain lab tests to check your response to ampicillin. If you are diabetic and test your urine for sugar, use Clinistix or TesTape (not Clinitest) to test your urine  while taking this medication. Do not let anyone else take your medication. Your prescription is probably not refillable. If you still have symptoms of infection after you finish the ampicillin, call your doctor. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.</Answer>
