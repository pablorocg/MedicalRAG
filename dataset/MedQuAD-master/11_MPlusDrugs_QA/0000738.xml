			<Question qid="0000738-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Maraviroc and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Maraviroc is used along with other medications to treat a certain type of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults and children who weigh at least 4.4 lb (2 kg). Maraviroc is in a class of medications called HIV entry and fusion inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although maraviroc does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000738-3" qtype="usage">How should Maraviroc be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Maraviroc comes as a tablet and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food twice a day. Take maraviroc at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take maraviroc exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow maraviroc tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Use one of the oral syringes that came with the medication for measuring the solution. Use the small (3-mL) oral syringe if your dose is 2.5 mL or less and use the large (10-mL) oral syringe if your dose is greater than 2.5 mL. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to measure your dose with the syringe. Follow the manufacturer's instructions about how to use and clean the oral syringe. If you are giving the solution to a child, place the tip of the oral syringe into the child's mouth against the inside of the cheek. Slowly push the plunger all the way down to give all of the medication in the oral syringe. Make sure that the child has enough time to swallow the solution. Continue to take maraviroc even if you feel well. Do not stop taking maraviroc without talking to your doctor. If you miss doses, take less than the prescribed dose, or stop taking maraviroc, your condition may become more difficult to treat. When your supply of maraviroc starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000738-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Maraviroc ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Discard any unused oral solution 60 days after first opening the bottle. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
