			<Question qid="0001063-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Rifabutin and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rifabutin helps to prevent or slow the spread of Mycobacterium avium complex disease (MAC; a bacterial infection that may cause serious symptoms) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It is also used in combination with other medications to eliminate  H. pylori , a bacteria that causes ulcers. Rifabutin is in a class of medications called antimycobacterials. It works by killing the bacteria that cause infection. Antibiotics such as rifabutin will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001063-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Rifabutin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
