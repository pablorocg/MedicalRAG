			<Question qid="0000415-2" qtype="usage">How should Eflornithine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Eflornithine comes as a cream to apply to the skin. It is usually applied twice a day. To help you remember to apply eflornithine cream, apply it around the same times every day, such as in the morning and in the evening. You should wait at least 8 hours between applications of eflornithine.  Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Apply eflornithine cream exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Eflornithine cream slows hair growth but does not prevent it. You should continue to use your current method of hair removal (e.g., shaving, plucking, cutting) or treatment while using eflornithine cream. It may take four weeks or longer before you see the full benefit of eflornithine cream. Do not stop applying eflornithine without talking to your doctor. Stopping use of eflornithine will cause hair to grow as it did before treatment. You should notice improvement (less time spent using your current method of hair removal) within 6 months of beginning treatment with eflornithine. If no improvement is seen, your doctor will likely ask you to stop using eflornithine. To use eflornithine cream, follow these steps:
 Wash and dry the affected area(s)., Apply a thin layer to affected area(s) and rub in until absorbed., Apply eflornithine cream only to affected skin areas. Do not allow the cream to get into your eyes, mouth, or vagina., You should wait at least 4 hours after applying eflornithine cream before washing the area where it was applied., You should wait at least 5 minutes after using your current method of hair removal before applying eflornithine.,  You may apply cosmetics or sunscreen after an application of eflornithine cream has dried. You may feel temporary stinging or burning if you apply eflornithine to broken skin.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000415-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Eflornithine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze eflornithine. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
