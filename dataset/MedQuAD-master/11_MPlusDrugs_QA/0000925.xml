			<Question qid="0000925-2" qtype="usage">How should Oxymetazoline Nasal Spray be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Oxymetazoline comes as a solution (liquid) to spray into the nose. It is usually used every 10 to 12 hours as needed, but not more often than twice in a 24-hour period. Follow the directions on the package label or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use oxymetazoline nasal spray exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor or directed on the label. If you use oxymetazoline nasal spray for more often or for longer than the recommended period of time, your congestion may get worse or may improve but come back. Do not use oxymetazoline nasal spray for longer than 3 days. If your symptoms do not get better after 3 days of treatment, stop using oxymetazoline and call your doctor. Oxymetazoline nasal spray is only for use in the nose. Do not swallow the medication. To prevent the spread of infection, do not share your spray dispenser with anyone else. Rinse the tip of the dispenser with hot water or wipe it clean after you use it. Follow the directions for using the nasal spray that appear on the package label. If you are using a product that comes in a pump dispenser, press down on the rim several times before using your first dose to prime the pump, according to the directions on the label. When you are ready to use the spray, hold your head upright without tilting and place the tip of the bottle in your nostril. For the nasal spray, squeeze the bottle quickly and firmly. For products that come in a pump dispenser, press down on the rim with a firm, even stroke and breathe in deeply.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000925-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Oxymetazoline Nasal Spray ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat, light, and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze the medication. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
