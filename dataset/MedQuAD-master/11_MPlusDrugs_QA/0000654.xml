			<Question qid="0000654-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Ivacaftor and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ivacaftor is used to treat certain types of cystic fibrosis (an inborn disease that causes problems with breathing, digestion, and reproduction) in adults and children 1 month of age and older. Ivacaftor should be used only in people with a certain genetic make-up. Your doctor may order a blood test to help decide if this medication is right for you. Ivacaftor is in a class of medications called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiators. It works by improving the function of a protein in the body to decrease the build-up of thick mucus in the lungs and improving other symptoms of cystic fibrosis.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000654-2" qtype="usage">How should Ivacaftor be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ivacaftor comes as a tablet and as granules to take by mouth. It is usually taken with fatty foods twice a day, 12 hours apart. Take ivacaftor at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ivacaftor exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. To prepare a dose of ivacaftor granules, mix the entire packet of granules in 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of cold or room temperature soft food or liquid such as yogurt, applesauce, water, milk, baby formula, breast milk, or juice. Take the mixture within 1 hour of mixing the granules with food or a liquid. Take each dose of ivacaftor with a fatty food such as eggs, butter, peanut butter, cheese pizza, whole-milk dairy products (such as whole milk, cheese, and yogurt), baby formula, and breast milk. Talk to your doctor about other fatty foods to eat with ivacaftor. Ivacaftor controls cystic fibrosis but does not cure it. Continue to take ivacaftor even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ivacaftor without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000654-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Ivacaftor ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
