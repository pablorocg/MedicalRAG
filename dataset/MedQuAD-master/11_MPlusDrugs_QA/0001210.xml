			<Question qid="0001210-2" qtype="usage">How should Timolol Ophthalmic be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ophthalmic timolol comes as a solution (liquid) and an extended-release (long-acting) gel-forming solution (liquid that thickens to a gel when instilled in the eye). Timolol eye drops are usuallyinstilled once or twice a day, at evenly spaced intervals, until pressure in the eye is controlled (about 4 weeks). Then it may be instilled once a day. Timolol gel-forming solution is usually instilled once a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use timolol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Timolol eye drops and gel-forming solution control glaucoma but do not cure it. Continue to use timolol even if you feel well. Do not stop using the medication without talking to your doctor. To instill the eye drops or eye gel, follow these steps:
 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water., If you are using the gel-forming solution, invert the container and shake it once. (There is no need to shake the eye-drops.) Make sure that the end of the dropper is not chipped or cracked., Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean., While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket., Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it., Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face., If you are using the eye drops, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. If you are using the gel-forming solution, check the directions that came with your medication to see whether you should push the bottom of the bottle so that a single drop falls out or press a specially marked area on the side of the bottle. If you are using the type of bottle that must be pushed from the bottom, be careful not to squeeze the sides of the bottle. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid., Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids., Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure., Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue., If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop., Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip., Wash your hands to remove any medication., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0001210-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Timolol Ophthalmic ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). If it becomes discolored or cloudy, obtain a fresh bottle. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
