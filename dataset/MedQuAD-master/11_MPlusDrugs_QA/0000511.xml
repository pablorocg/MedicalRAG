			<Answer>Fluocinolone topical comes in ointment, cream, solution, shampoo, and oil in various strengths for use on the skin or scalp. Fluocinolone ointment, cream, solution, and oil are usually applied two to four times a day. Fluocinolone shampoo is usually applied once a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use fluocinolone topical exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply it to other areas of your body or wrap or  use it to treat other skin conditions unless directed to do so by your doctor. Your skin condition should improve during the first 2 weeks of your treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during this time. To use fluocinolone topical, apply a small amount of the ointment, cream, solution, or oil  to cover the affected area of skin with in a thin even film and rub it in gently. To use the shampoo, shake the bottle well, apply a small amount of the medicine to the scalp, and use your fingers to form a lather. Leave the shampoo on your skin for 5 minutes and then rinse the shampoo out of your hair and off your body with plenty of water. Do not cover your head with a shower cap, bathing cap, or towel while the shampoo is on your scalp unless directed to do so by your doctor. To use the ointment, cream, or solution on your scalp, part your hair, apply a small amount of the medicine on the affected area, and rub it in gently. To use the oil on your scalp to treat psoriasis, wet your hair and scalp and apply a small amount of the oil to the scalp and rub it in gently.  Cover your head with the shower cap supplied for at least 4 hours or overnight and then wash your hair as usual, making sure to rinse your hair thoroughly. This medication is only for use on the skin or scalp. Do not let fluocinolone topical get into your eyes or mouth and do not swallow fluocinolone. Avoid use on the face, in the genital and rectal areas, and in skin creases and armpits unless directed by your doctor to use in these areas. Do not wrap or bandage the treated area unless your doctor tells you that you should. Such use may increase side effects. If you are using fluocinolone topical on a child's diaper area, do not use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants. Such use may increase side effects. Do not apply cosmetics or other skin preparations or products on the treated area without talking with your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000511-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Fluocinolone Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze it. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
