			<Question qid="0001099-2" qtype="usage">How should Scopolamine Transdermal Patch be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Scopolamine comes as a patch to be placed on the hairless skin behind your ear. When used to help prevent nausea and vomiting caused by motion sickness, apply the patch at least 4 hours before its effects will be needed and leave in place for up to 3 days. If treatment is needed for longer than 3 days to help prevent nausea and vomiting caused by motion sickness, remove the current patch and apply a new patch behind the other ear. When used to prevent nausea and vomiting from medications used with surgery, apply the patch as directed by your doctor and leave it in place for 24 hours after your surgery. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use the scopolamine patch exactly as directed. To apply the patch, follow these instructions:
 After washing the area behind the ear, wipe the area with a clean, dry tissue to ensure that the area is dry. Avoid placing on areas of your skin that have cuts, pain, or tenderness., Remove the patch from its protective pouch. Peel off the clear plastic protective strip and discard it. Don't touch the exposed adhesive layer with your fingers., Place the adhesive side against the skin., After you have placed the patch behind your ear, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.,  Do not cut the patch. Limit contact with water while swimming and bathing because it may cause the patch may fall off. If the scopolamine patch falls off, discard the patch, and apply a new one on the hairless area behind the other ear. When the scopolamine patch is no longer needed, remove the patch and fold it in half with the sticky side together and dispose of it. Wash your hands and the area behind your ear thoroughly with soap and water to remove any traces of scopolamine from the area. If a new patch needs to be applied, place a fresh patch on the hairless area behind your other ear. If you have used scopolamine patches for several days or longer, you may experience withdrawal symptoms that could start 24 hours or more after removing the scopolamine patch such as difficulty with balance, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, sweating, headache, confusion, muscle weakness, slow heart rate or low blood pressure.

			<Question qid="0001099-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Scopolamine Transdermal Patch ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Store patches in an upright position; do not bend or roll them. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program.
