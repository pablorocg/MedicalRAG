			<Question qid="0000478-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Ezogabine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>

			<Question qid="0000478-3" qtype="usage">How should Ezogabine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ezogabine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food three times a day. Take ezogabine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, dissolve, or crush them. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of ezogabine and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every week. Take ezogabine exactly as prescribed. Ezogabine may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor. Ezogabine may help control your condition but will not cure it. It may take a few weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of ezogabine. Continue to take ezogabine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ezogabine without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking ezogabine, your seizures may happen more often. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually over at least 3 weeks.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000478-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Ezogabine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Store ezogabine in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Keep track of how many tablets are left so you will know if any are missing. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
