			<Answer>Enzalutamide is used to treat prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body in men and who have been helped by certain medical and surgical treatments that decrease testosterone levels. It is also used to treat prostate cancer in men who have not been helped by certain medical and surgical treatments that decrease testosterone levels.

			<Question qid="0000431-2" qtype="usage">How should Enzalutamide be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take enzalutamide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets or capsules whole; do not crush, chew, divide, dissolve, or open them. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking enzalutamide for a short time or decrease your dose if you experience serious side effects during your treatment. Be sure to talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment with enzalutamide. If your doctor has prescribed another medication such as degarelix (Firmagon), goserelin (Zoladex), histrelin (Supprelin LA, Vantas), leuprolide (Eligard, Lupron, in Lupaneta Pack), or triptorelin (Trelstar, Triptodur) to treat your prostate cancer, you will need to continue receiving this medication during your treatment with enzalutamide.

			<Question qid="0000431-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Enzalutamide ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
