			<Question qid="0001150-2" qtype="usage">How should Suvorexant be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Suvorexant comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day, if needed, no earlier than 30 minutes before bedtime. Suvorexant may be taken with or without food but will begin to work faster if taken on an empty stomach. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take suvorexant exactly as directed. Never take more than one dose of suvorexant per day even if you are still having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. You will probably become very sleepy soon after you take suvorexant and will remain sleepy for some time after you take the medication. Plan to go to bed right after you take the medication and to stay in bed for at least 7 hours. Do not take suvorexant if you will be unable to remain asleep for the required number of hours after taking the medication. If you get up too soon after taking suvorexant, you may experience drowsiness and difficulty driving or performing tasks that require alertness. Your sleep problems should improve within 7 to 10 days after you start taking suvorexant. Call your doctor if your sleep problems do not improve during this time or if they get worse at any time during your treatment. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of suvorexant and may gradually increase your dose if your insomnia does not improve. Your doctor may also decrease your dose of suvorexant or tell you to stop taking the medication if it makes you feel too drowsy during the day. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Suvorexant may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with suvorexant and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001150-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Suvorexant ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Store suvorexant in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Keep track of how many tablets are left so you will know if any are missing. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
