			<Question qid="0000004-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about AbobotulinumtoxinA Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>AbobotulinumtoxinA injection may spread from the area of injection and cause symptoms of botulism, including severe or life-threatening difficulty breathing or swallowing. People who develop difficulty swallowing during their treatment with this medication may continue to have this difficulty for several weeks, may need to be fed through a feeding tube, and may breathe food or drink into their lungs. Symptoms can occur within hours of an injection with abobotulinumtoxinA or as late as several weeks after treatment. Symptoms may occur in people of any age being treated for any condition, but the risk is probably highest in children being treated for spasticity (muscle stiffness and tightness). Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had any swallowing problems or breathing problems, such as asthma or emphysema, or any condition that affects your muscles or nerves, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease; condition in which the nerves that control muscle movement slowly die, causing the muscles to shrink and weaken), motor neuropathy (condition in which the muscles weaken over time), myasthenia gravis (condition that causes certain muscles to weaken, especially after activity), or Lambert-Eaton syndrome (condition that causes muscle weakness that may improve with activity). If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: loss of strength or muscle weakness all over the body; double or blurred vision; drooping eyelids; difficulty swallowing, breathing, or speaking; or inability to control urination. Your doctor will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with abobotulinumtoxinA injection and each time you receive treatment. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

It is also used to temporarily smooth frown lines (wrinkles between the eyebrows). AbobotulinumtoxinA injection is used to treat spasticity (muscle stiffness and tightness) of muscles in the arms and legs in adults and children 2 years of age and older.

			<Question qid="0000004-3" qtype="usage">How should AbobotulinumtoxinA Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>AbobotulinumtoxinA injection comes as a powder to be mixed with a liquid and injected into affected muscles by a doctor. Your doctor will choose the best place to inject the medication in order to treat your condition. You may receive additional injections of abobotulinumtoxinA every 3 to 4 months, depending on your condition and how long the effects of the treatment last. If you are receiving abobotulinumtoxinA injection for cervical dystonia, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose and gradually change your dose according to your response to the medication. One brand or type of botulinum toxin cannot be substituted for another. AbobotulinumtoxinA injection may help control your condition but will not cure it. If you are using abobotulinumtoxinA to treat cervical dystonia, it may take 2 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of abobotulinumtoxinA injection.</Answer>
