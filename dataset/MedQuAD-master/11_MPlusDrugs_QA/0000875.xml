			<Question qid="0000875-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Nitroglycerin Topical and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nitroglycerin ointment (Nitro-Bid) is used to prevent episodes of angina (chest pain) in people who have coronary artery disease (narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart). Nitroglycerin ointment can only be used to prevent attacks of angina; it cannot be used to treat an attack of angina once it has begun. Nitroglycerin ointment (Rectiv) is used in adults to treat pain from anal fissures (a split or tear in the tissue near the rectal area). Nitroglycerin is in a class of medications called vasodilators. Nitroglycerin ointment prevents angina by relaxing the blood vessels so that the heart does not need to work as hard and therefore does not need as much oxygen. Nitroglycerin ointment treats anal fissure pain by relaxing the blood vessels, which reduces the pressure in the anal tissues.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000875-2" qtype="usage">How should Nitroglycerin Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Topical nitroglycerin comes as an ointment to apply to the skin. When used to prevent angina, it is usually applied twice a day, once right after waking in the morning, and again 6 hours later. When used to treat anal fissure pain, it is usually applied every 12 hours for up to 3 weeks. If you still have anal fissure pain after using the ointment for 3 weeks, call your doctor. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nitroglycerin ointment exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you are using nitroglycerin ointment to prevent angina, your doctor will probably start you on a lower dose of nitroglycerin ointment and may gradually increase your dose as needed to control your angina. Nitroglycerin ointment may not work as well after it has been used for some time, especially at higher doses. To help prevent this, your doctor will schedule your doses so that there is a period of time when you are not exposed to nitroglycerin every day. If your angina attacks happen more often, last longer, or become more severe at any time during your treatment, call your doctor. Nitroglycerin ointment helps to prevent angina attacks but does not cure coronary artery disease. Continue to use nitroglycerin ointment even if you feel well. Do not stop using nitroglycerin ointment without talking to your doctor. If you are using nitroglycerin ointment to prevent angina, follow your doctor's directions and the guidelines in this paragraph to apply the medication. Nitroglycerin ointment comes with a paper applicator with a ruled line for measuring the dose (in inches). Place the paper on a flat surface and squeeze the ointment onto the paper, carefully measuring the amount specified on your prescription label. If your ointment comes in foil packets, you should know that each packet contains 1 inch of ointment and is to be used for a single dose only. Place the paper on your skin with the ointment side down, and use the paper to lightly spread the ointment to cover an area of skin at least as large as the applicator. Do not rub the ointment into the skin. Tape the applicator in place and cover it with a piece of plastic kitchen wrap to prevent the ointment from staining your clothing. If your ointment comes in a tube, replace the cap and screw it on tightly. If your ointment came in a small foil packet, dispose of the packet. Try not to get the ointment on your fingers. Wash your hands after applying the ointment. If you are using nitroglycerin ointment to treat anal fissure pain, follow your doctor's directions and the guidelines in this paragraph to apply the medication. Cover your finger with plastic wrap, a disposable surgical glove, or a finger cot. Lay the covered finger alongside the 1 inch dosing line on the side of the nitroglycerin ointment box so that the tip of the finger is at one end of the dosing line. Starting at the finger tip, squeeze the ointment onto your finger for the same length as marked on the box by the 1-inch dosing line. Gently insert the finger with the ointment into the anal canal, up to the first finger joint. Smear the ointment around the inside of the anal canal. If this is too painful, then apply the ointment directly to the outside of the anus. Dispose of the finger covering. Wash your hands after applying the ointment. If you are using nitroglycerin ointment to treat anal fissure pain, ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000875-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Nitroglycerin Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication out of reach of children. Close the ointment tube tightly after each use. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). If you are using nitroglycerin ointment to treat anal fissure pain, dispose of any leftover ointment 8 weeks after the tube was first opened. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
