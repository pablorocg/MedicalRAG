			<Question qid="0001114-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Simeprevir and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Simeprevir is used along with ribavirin (Copegus, Rebetol) and peginterferon alfa (Pegasys) to treat chronic hepatitis C (an ongoing viral infection that damages the liver). Simeprevir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the body. Simeprevir may not prevent the spread of hepatitis C to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001114-2" qtype="usage">How should Simeprevir be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Simeprevir comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food once a day. Take simeprevir at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take simeprevir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. You will take simeprevir with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for 12 weeks. Then you will stop taking simeprevir and will take peginterferon and ribavirin for an additional 12 or 36 weeks. The length of your treatment depends on whether you have received prior treatment for hepatitis C, how you responded to prior treatment, how you respond to the medications, and whether you experience severe side effects. Continue to take simeprevir, peginterferon alfa, and ribavirin as long as they are prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking any of these medications without talking to your doctor even if you are feeling well. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001114-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Simeprevir ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
