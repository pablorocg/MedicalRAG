			<Question qid="0000212-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Cefotaxime Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Cefotaxime injection is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria including pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract (lung) infections; gonorrhea (a sexually transmitted disease); meningitis (infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) and other brain and spinal cord infections; and abdominal (stomach area), female reproductive organs, skin, blood, bone, joint, and urinary tract infections. Cefotaxime injection may also be used before surgery, and during and after a cesarean section, in order to prevent the patient from getting an infection. Cefotaxime injection is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as cefotaxime injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>
