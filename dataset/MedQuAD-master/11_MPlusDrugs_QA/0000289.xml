			<Question qid="0000289-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Colestipol and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Colestipol is used along with diet changes to decrease the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') in certain people with high cholesterol.

			<Question qid="0000289-2" qtype="usage">How should Colestipol be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Colestipol comes as tablets and granules to take by mouth. The tablets are usually taken once or twice daily. The granules are usually taken one to six times daily. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take colestipol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Unless otherwise instructed, take all other medications at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after you take colestipol because it can interfere with their absorption. Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water or another liquid; do not chew, split, or crush them. Your doctor may gradually increase your dose at 1 to 2 month intervals, depending on your response. Continue to take colestipol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking colestipol without talking to your doctor. Do not take the granules dry. Add them to at least 3 ounces (90 milliliters) of a liquid (e.g., fruit juice, water, milk, or soft drink) and stir until completely mixed. If you use a carbonated beverage, mix it slowly in a large glass to minimize foaming. After taking the dose, rinse the glass with a small amount of additional liquid and drink it to be sure that you receive the entire dose. Colestipol also may be mixed with hot or regular breakfast cereals, thin soups (e.g., tomato and chicken noodle), or pulpy fruit (e.g., crushed pineapple, pears, peaches, and fruit cocktail).</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000289-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Colestipol ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
