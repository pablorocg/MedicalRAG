			<Question qid="0001101-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Secukinumab Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Secukinumab injection is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (a skin disease in which red, scaly patches form on some areas of the body) in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose psoriasis is too severe to be treated by topical medications alone. It is also used in adults and children 2 years of age and older to treat psoriatic arthritis (a condition that causes joint pain and swelling and scales on the skin). Secukinumab injection is used in adults to treat ankylosing spondylitis (a condition in which the body attacks the joints of the spine and other areas, causing pain, swelling, and joint damage). It is also used in adults to treat active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (a condition in which the body attacks the joints of the spine and other areas, causing pain and signs of swelling, but without changes seen on x-ray). Secukinumab is also used in the treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis (a condition in which the body attacks its own joints, causing pain, swelling, and loss of function) in children 4 years of age and older. It is also used in adults to treat hidradenitis suppurativa (a skin disease that causes small, painful lumps to form under the skin).Secukinumab injection is in a class of medications called interleukin-17A (IL-17A) receptor inhibitors. It works by blocking the activity of interleukin-17A, a substance in the body that causes inflammation.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001101-2" qtype="usage">How should Secukinumab Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Secukinumab injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) over about 30 minutes by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or as a prefilled syringe and a dosing pen to inject subcutaneously (under the skin) by yourself at home. If secukinumab injection is given subcutaneously, it is usually injected once every week for the first 5 doses and then once every 4 weeks. For psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and axial spondyloarthritis, it may also be injected subcutaneously or intravenously once every 4 weeks. When secukinumab injection is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa, it is usually given subcutaneously once every week for the first 5 doses and then every 2 or 4 weeks. If you are injecting secukinumab injection yourself, follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use secukinumab injection exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You will receive your first subcutaneous dose of secukinumab injection in your doctor's office. After that, your doctor may allow you to inject secukinumab yourself or have a friend or relative perform the injections. Your doctor or nurse will show you or a caregiver how to prepare and inject a dose of secukinumab injection at home. Before you use secukinumab injection yourself the first time, read the manufacturer's instructions for use that comes with the medication. These instructions describe how to prepare and inject a dose of secukinumab. Be sure that you understand these directions. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about when you should use the medication, where on your body you should inject the medication, or how to prepare and give the injection. If you are using a prefilled syringe or a dosing pen that has been refrigerated, place the syringe or pen on a flat surface without removing the needle cap and allow it warm to room temperature for 15-45 minutes (depending on the product being used) before you are ready to inject the medication. Do not try to warm the medication by heating it in a microwave, placing it in hot water, or through any other method. Do not shake a syringe or dosing pen that contains secukinumab. Always look at secukinumab solution before injecting it. Check that the expiration date has not passed and that the liquid is clear and colorless or pale yellow. The liquid should not contain visible particles. Do not use a syringe or dosing pen if it is cracked or broken, if it is expired, or if the liquid is cloudy or contains large or colored particles. Use each syringe or dosing pen only once and inject all the solution in the syringe or pen. Dispose of used syringes and pens in a puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container. You can inject secukinumab injection anywhere on the front of your thighs (upper leg) or abdomen (stomach) except your navel and the area 2 inches (5 centimeters) around it. If another person is injecting your medication, the outer area of the upper arms also may be used. To reduce the chances of soreness or redness, use a different site for each injection. Do not inject into an area where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard or where you have scars or stretch marks. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with secukinumab injection. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001101-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Secukinumab Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store secukinumab injection in the refrigerator but do not freeze. Keep the prefilled syringes and dosing pens in their original cartons to protect them from light. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
