			<Question qid="0000166-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Brompheniramine and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Brompheniramine relieves red, irritated, itchy, watery eyes; sneezing; and runny nose caused by allergies, hay fever, and the common cold. Brompheniramine helps control symptoms, but does not treat the cause of the symptoms or speed recovery. Brompheniramine should not be used to cause sleepiness in children. Brompheniramine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000166-3" qtype="usage">How should Brompheniramine be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Brompheniramine comes in combination with other cough and cold medications as a chewable tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) capsule, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and a liquid to be taken by mouth. The chewable tablet and liquid are usually taken every 4 to 6 hours as needed. The extended-release tablets and capsules are usually taken every 8 or 12 hours as needed. Follow the directions on the package label or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take brompheniramine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor. Brompheniramine comes in combination with other cough and cold medications. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for your symptoms. Check nonprescription cough and cold product labels carefully before taking two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child. Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain brompheniramine, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 6 years of age. If you give these products to children 6-11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully. If you are giving a product that contains brompheniramine to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give brompheniramine products that are made for adults to children. Before you give a brompheniramine product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child. If you are taking the liquid, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use the measuring spoon or cup that came with the medication or use a spoon made especially for measuring medication. If you are taking the extended-release tablets or capsules swallow them whole; do not crush, break, or chew them. Stop taking brompheniramine and call your doctor if your symptoms last longer than 7 days or if you have a fever.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000166-9" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Brompheniramine ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
