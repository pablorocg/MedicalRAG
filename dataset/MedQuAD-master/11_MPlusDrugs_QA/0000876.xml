			<Question qid="0000876-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Nitroglycerin Transdermal Patch and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nitroglycerin transdermal patches are used to prevent episodes of angina (chest pain) in people who have coronary artery disease (narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart). Nitroglycerin transdermal patches can only be used to prevent attacks of angina; they cannot be used to treat an attack of angina once it has begun. Nitroglycerin is in a class of medications called vasodilators. It works by relaxing the blood vessels so that the heart does not need to work as hard and therefore does not need as much oxygen.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000876-2" qtype="usage">How should Nitroglycerin Transdermal Patch be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Transdermal nitroglycerin comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is usually applied once a day, worn for 12 to 14 hours, and then removed. Apply nitroglycerin patches at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nitroglycerin patches exactly as directed. Do not apply more or fewer patches or apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor. Choose a spot on your upper body or upper arms to apply your patch. Do not apply the patch to your arms below the elbows, to your legs below the knees, or to skin folds. Apply the patch to clean, dry, hairless skin that is not irritated, scarred, burned, broken, or calloused. Choose a different area each day. You may shower while you are wearing a nitroglycerin skin patch. If a patch loosens or falls off, replace it with a fresh one. To use nitroglycerin patches, follow the steps below. Different brands of nitroglycerin patches may be applied in slightly different ways, so be sure to follow the directions included with your patches:
 Wash your hands., Hold the patch so that the plastic backing is facing you., Bend the sides of the patch away from you and then toward you until you hear a snap., Peel off one side of the plastic backing., Use the other side of the patch as a handle, and apply the stick half to your skin in the spot you have chosen., Press the sticky side of the patch against the skin and smooth it down., Fold back the other side of the patch. Hold onto the remaining piece of plastic backing and use it to pull the patch across the skin., Wash your hands again., When you are ready to remove the patch, press down on its center to lift the edges away from the skin., Hold the edge gently and slowly peel the patch away from the skin., Fold the patch in half with the sticky side pressed together and dispose of it safely, out of the reach of children and pets. The used patch may still contain active medication that can harm others., Wash the skin that was covered with the patch with soap and water. The skin may be red and may feel warm for a short time. You may apply lotion if the skin is dry, and you should call your doctor if the redness does not go away after a short time.,  Nitroglycerin patches may no longer work as well after you have used them for some time. To prevent this, your doctor will probably tell you to wear each patch for only 12 to 14 hours each day so that there is a period of time when you are not exposed to nitroglycerin every day. If your angina attacks happen more often, last longer, or become more severe at any time during your treatment, call your doctor. Nitroglycerin patches help prevent attacks of angina but do not cure coronary artery disease. Continue to use nitroglycerin patches even if you feel well. Do not stop using nitroglycerin patches without talking to your doctor.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000876-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Nitroglycerin Transdermal Patch ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Throw away any medication that is outdated or no longer needed. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
