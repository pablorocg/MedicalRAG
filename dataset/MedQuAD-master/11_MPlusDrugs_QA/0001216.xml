			<Question qid="0001216-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Tobramycin Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tobramycin injection is used to treat certain serious infections that are caused by bacteria such as meningitis (infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) and infections of the blood, abdomen (stomach area), lungs, skin, bones, joints, and urinary tract. Tobramycin injection is in a class of medications called aminoglycoside antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as tobramycin injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001216-3" qtype="usage">How should Tobramycin Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Tobramycin injection comes as a liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) or intramuscularly (into a muscle). When tobramycin is injected intravenously, it is usually infused (injected slowly) over a period of 20 to 60 minutes as frequently as every 6 hours but may be given less often depending on your age or other factors. Your doctor will decide how often you should receive tobramycin, The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have. You may receive tobramycin injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you will be receiving tobramycin injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with tobramycin injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Use tobramycin injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using tobramycin injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>
