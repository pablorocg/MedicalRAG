			<Question qid="0000055-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Aminocaproic Acid and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Aminocaproic acid is used to control bleeding that occurs when blood clots are broken down too quickly. This type of bleeding may occur during or after heart or liver surgery; in people who have certain bleeding disorders; in people who have cancer of the prostate (a male reproductive gland), lung, stomach, or cervix (opening of the uterus); and in pregnant women experiencing placental abruption (placenta separates from the uterus before the baby is ready to be born). Aminocaproic acid is also used to control bleeding in the urinary tract (the organs in the body that produce and excrete urine) that may occur after prostate or kidney surgery or in people who have certain types of cancer. Aminocaproic acid should not be used to treat bleeding that is not caused by faster than normal clot breakdown, so your doctor may order tests to find the cause of your bleeding before you begin your treatment. Aminocaproic acid is in a class of medications called hemostatics. It works by slowing the breakdown of blood clots.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000055-2" qtype="usage">How should Aminocaproic Acid be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Aminocaproic acid comes as a tablet and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once an hour for about 8 hours or until the bleeding is controlled. When aminocaproic acid is used to treat ongoing bleeding, it is usually taken every 3 to 6 hours. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take aminocaproic acid exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Shake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Your doctor may start you on a high dose of aminocaproic acid and gradually decrease your dose as the bleeding is controlled.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000055-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Aminocaproic Acid ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Throw away any medication that is outdated or no longer needed. Talk to your pharmacist about the proper disposal of your medication. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
