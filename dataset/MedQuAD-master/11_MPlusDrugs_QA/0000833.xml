			<Question qid="0000833-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Nafarelin and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nafarelin nasal spray is used to manage endometriosis (a condition in which the type of tissue that lines the uterus [womb] grows in other areas of the body and causes infertility, pain before and during menstrual periods, pain during and after sexual activity, and heavy or irregular bleeding). Nafarelin nasal spray is also used to treat central precocious puberty (CPP; a condition causing children to enter puberty too soon, resulting in faster than normal bone growth and development of sexual characteristics) in young boys and girls. Nafarelin is in a class of medications called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. It works by decreasing the amount of certain hormones in the body.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000833-2" qtype="usage">How should Nafarelin be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Nafarelin comes as a solution (liquid) to spray in the nose.  Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nafarelin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop using nafarelin nasal spray without talking to your doctor. If you are using nafarelin nasal spray to treat endometriosis, it is usually used twice a day (about 12 hours apart)  as one spray in one nostril in the morning and one spray in the other nostril in the evening, for total of 2 sprays per day. Nafarelin should be started between the second and fourth days of your menstrual period. After 2 months and depending on your response, your doctor may increase your dose to 1 spray in each nostril twice a day, for a total of 4 sprays per day. The length of treatment is usually about 6 months. If you are using nafarelin nasal spray to treat precocious puberty, it is usually sprayed in each nostril 2 or 3 times a day. If you are using nafarelin nasal spray 2 times a day, it is usually used as 2 sprays in each nostril, for a total of 8 sprays per day. It may also be used as 3 sprays in alternating nostrils 3 times a day, for a total of 9 sprays per day. Avoid sneezing or blowing your nose during or immediately after using nafarelin nasal spray. This decreases nafarelin's effectiveness. Before you use nafarelin nasal spray for the first time, read the written directions that come with it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to use the nasal spray. To use the nasal spray, follow these steps:
 Remove the plastic cap and safety clip from the nasal spray pump., If you are using the nasal spray pump for the first time, you must prime the pump. Hold the bottle upright with the applicator between your forefinger and middle finger and your thumb under the bottle. Point the bottle upright and away from your face. Press your thumb and fingers firmly and quickly against the pump 7 to 10 times until you see a fine spray., Before and after using nafarelin nasal spray, hold the spray pump horizontally, and rinse the tip of the spray pump with warm water for 15 seconds while wiping the tip with a cloth or your finger. Wipe the tip with a clean tissue to dry., Blow your nose until your nostrils are clear., Close one nostril by gently placing your finger against the side of your nose, tilt your head slightly forward and, keeping the bottle upright, insert the nasal tip into the other nostril. Children using the nasal spray should have their head tilted slightly back. Point the tip toward the back and outer side of the nose., Begin to breathe in through your nose. While you are breathing, press firmly and quickly upwards with the thumb at the base while holding the white shoulder portion of the pump between your index and middle fingers. Remove the sprayer from your nose and tilt your head back for a few seconds., If your doctor told you to use two sprays in the same nostril, you should wait 30 seconds and then repeat steps 5 and 6 in the same nostril., If your doctor told you to use the spray in the other nostril, repeat steps 5 through 6 in the other nostril., Repeat step 3 to clean the spray tip and replace the cap and safety clip., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000833-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Nafarelin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, upright,  tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
