			<Question qid="0001229-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Topotecan Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Topotecan injection should be given only in a hospital or clinic under the supervision of a doctor with experience in the use of chemotherapy medications for cancer. Topotecan injection may cause a decrease in the number of white blood cells (a type of blood cell that is needed to fight infection). This increases the risk that you will develop a serious or life-threatening infection. Topotecan injection also may cause thrombocytopenia (less than normal number of platelets) which can increase the risk of serious or life-threatening bleeding problems.  Your doctor will order laboratory tests regularly before and during your treatment to check whether your body has enough white blood cells or platelets. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: fever, chills, cough, unusual bruising or bleeding, burning on urination, or other signs of infection. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using topotecan injection.</Answer>
