			<Question qid="0000960-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Penicillin G Procaine Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Penicillin G procaine injection is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria. Penicillin G procaine injection should not be used to treat gonorrhea (a sexually transmitted disease) or early in the treatment of certain serious infections. Penicillin G procaine injection is in a class of medications called penicillins. It works by killing bacteria that cause infections. Antibiotics such as penicillin G procaine injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000960-2" qtype="usage">How should Penicillin G Procaine Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Penicillin G procaine injection comes as a suspension (liquid) in a prefilled syringe to inject into the muscles of the buttocks or thigh by a doctor or nurse in a medical facility. It is usually given once a day. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection that you have and how well you respond to the medication.

You may experience a sudden severe reaction immediately after receiving a dose of penicillin G procaine injection that may last for approximately 15 to 30 minutes. Tell your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms right after your injection: anxiety, confusion, agitation, depression, weakness, seizures, seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist, aggressive behavior, and fear of dying.</Answer>
