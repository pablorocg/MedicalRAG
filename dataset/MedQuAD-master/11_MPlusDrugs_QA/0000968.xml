			<Question qid="0000968-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Peramivir Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Peramivir injection is used to treat certain types of influenza infection ('flu') in adults and children 6 months of age and older who have had symptoms of the flu for no longer than 2 days. Peramivir injection is in a class of medications called neuraminidase inhibitors. It works by stopping the spread of the flu virus in the body. Peramivir injection helps shorten the time that flu symptoms such as a stuffy or runny nose, sore throat, cough, muscle or joint aches, tiredness, headache, fever, and chills last. Peramivir injection will not prevent bacterial infections, which may occur as a complication of the flu.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000968-4" qtype="precautions">Are there safety concerns or special precautions about Peramivir Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Before receiving peramivir injection, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to peramivir injection, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in peramivir injection. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients., tell your doctor what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects., tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney disease., tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while receiving peramivir injection, call your doctor., you should know that people, especially children and teenagers, who have the flu, and some receiving medications such as peramivir, may become confused, agitated, or anxious, and may behave strangely, have seizures or hallucinate (see things or hear voices that do not exist), or harm or kill themselves. If you have the flu, you, your family, or your caregiver should call the doctor right away if you become confused, behave abnormally, or think about harming yourself. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own., ask your doctor if you should receive a flu vaccination each year. Peramivir injection does not take the place of a yearly flu vaccine. If you received or plan to receive the intranasal flu vaccine (FluMist; flu vaccine that is sprayed into the nose), you should tell your doctor before receiving peramivir injection. Peramivir injection may make the intranasal flu vaccine less effective if it is received up to 2 weeks after or up to 48 hours before the intranasal flu vaccine is given., </Answer>
