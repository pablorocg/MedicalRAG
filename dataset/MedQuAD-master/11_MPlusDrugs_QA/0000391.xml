			<Question qid="0000391-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Doripenem Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Doripenem injection is used to treat serious infections of the urinary tract, kidney, and abdomen that are caused by bacteria. Doripenem injection is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat pneumonia that developed in people who were on a ventilator in a hospital. Doripenem injection is in a class of medications called carbapenem antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as doripenem injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000391-2" qtype="usage">How should Doripenem Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Doripenem injection comes as a liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein). It is usually given every 8 hours. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection being treated. After your condition improves, your doctor may switch you to another antibiotic that you can take by mouth to complete your treatment. You may receive doripenem injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you are using doripenem injection at home, use it at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use doripenem injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with doripenem injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Use doripenem injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using doripenem injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>
