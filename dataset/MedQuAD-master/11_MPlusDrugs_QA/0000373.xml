			<Question qid="0000373-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Dimethyl Fumarate and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dimethyl fumarate is used to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and people may experience weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination, and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control) including clinically isolated syndrome (CIS; nerve symptom episodes that last at least 24 hours), relapsing-remitting forms (course of disease where symptoms flare up from time to time), or secondary progressive forms (course of disease where relapses occur more often). Dimethyl fumarate is in a class of medications called Nrf2 activators. It works by decreasing inflammation and preventing nerve damage that may cause symptoms of multiple sclerosis.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000373-2" qtype="usage">How should Dimethyl Fumarate be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Dimethyl fumarate comes as a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent break-down of the medication by stomach acids) capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day. Take dimethyl fumarate at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take dimethyl fumarate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Dimethyl fumarate may be taken with or without food. However, if you take dimethyl fumarate with food or with a non-enteric coated aspirin (325 mg or less) 30 minutes before taking dimethyl fumarate, there is less of a chance that you will experience flushing during your treatment. Swallow the capsules whole; do not chew or crush them. Do not open the capsules or sprinkle the contents on food. Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of dimethyl fumarate and increase your dose after 7 days. Dimethyl fumarate may help to control multiple sclerosis, but will not cure it. Continue to take dimethyl fumarate even if you feel well. Do not stop taking dimethyl fumarate without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000373-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Dimethyl Fumarate ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
