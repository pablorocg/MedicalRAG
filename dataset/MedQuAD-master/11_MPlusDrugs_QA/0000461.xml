			<Question qid="0000461-2" qtype="usage">How should Eszopiclone be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Eszopiclone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day at bedtime or after unsuccessfully trying to fall asleep. Do not take eszopiclone with or shortly after a heavy, high-fat meal. Eszopiclone may not work well if it is taken with high fat foods. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take eszopiclone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You will probably become very sleepy soon after you take eszopiclone and will remain sleepy for some time after you take the medication. You should only take eszopiclone immediately before you go to bed or after you have gone to bed and have been unable to fall asleep. Only take eszopiclone if you will be able to stay in bed for at least 7 to 8 hours after taking the medication. If you do not go to bed right after you take eszopiclone or if you get up too soon after taking eszopiclone, you may experience dizziness, lightheadedness, hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist), and problems with coordination and memory. Your doctor may change your dose of eszopiclone during your treatment. Your doctor may increase your dose to help you sleep better or decrease your dose if you are too drowsy during the daytime. You should be sleeping well within 7 to 10 days after you start taking eszopiclone. Call your doctor if your sleep problems do not improve during this time, if they get worse at any time during your treatment, or if you notice any changes in your thoughts or behavior. Do not stop taking eszopiclone without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking eszopiclone you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, unusual dreams, stomach and muscle cramps,nausea, vomiting, sweating, shakiness, and rarely, seizures. After you stop taking eszopiclone, you may have more difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep than you did before you took the medication. These sleep problems are normal and usually get better without treatment after one or two nights. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with eszopiclone and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000461-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Eszopiclone ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
