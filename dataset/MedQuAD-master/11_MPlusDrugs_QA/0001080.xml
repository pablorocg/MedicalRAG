			<Question qid="0001080-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Rizatriptan and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rizatriptan is used to treat the symptoms of migraine headaches (severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound and light). Rizatriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain, stopping pain signals from being sent to the brain, and blocking the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms of migraine. Rizatriptan does not prevent migraine attacks or reduce the number of headaches you have.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001080-2" qtype="usage">How should Rizatriptan be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Rizatriptan comes as a tablet and an orally disintegrating tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken at the first sign of a migraine headache. If your symptoms improve after you take rizatriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may take a second tablet. However, if your symptoms do not improve after you take rizatriptan, do not take a second tablet before calling your doctor. Your doctor will tell you the maximum number of tablets you may take in a 24-hour period. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rizatriptan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor. You may take your first dose of rizatriptan in a doctor's office or other medical facility where you can be monitored for serious reactions. To take the orally disintegrating tablet, use dry hands to peel back the foil packaging.Immediately take out the tablet and place it on your tongue.The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva. No water is needed to swallow disintegrating tablets. Do not open the foil packaging or remove the orally disintegrating tablet until just before your are ready to take it. Call your doctor if your headaches do not get better or occur more frequently after taking rizatriptan. If you take rizatriptan more often or for longer than the recommended period of time, your headaches may get worse or may occur more frequently. You should not take rizatriptan or any other headache medication for more than 10 days per month. Call your doctor if you need to take rizatriptan to treat more than four headaches in a 1-month period. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001080-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Rizatriptan ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Do not remove tablets from the blister pack until just before use. Store the medication at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
