			<Question qid="0000643-2" qtype="usage">How should Isavuconazonium be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Isavuconazonium comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food every 8 hours for the first six doses and then once a day. Take isavuconazonium at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take isavuconazonium exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the capsules whole; do not open, chew, dissolve, or crush them. The length of your treatment depends on your general health, the type of infection you have, and how well you respond to the medication. Continue to take isavuconazonium even if you feel well. Do not stop taking isavuconazonium without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000643-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Isavuconazonium ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Isavuconazonium comes in blister packaging and each blister section has two pockets. The left pocket has a desiccant (small packet that contains a substance that absorbs moisture to keep the medication dry) and the right pocket has the medication. Only open the isavuconazonium pocket and leave the desiccant in the packaging. Do not remove isavuconazonium from the original packaging until you are ready to take your dose. Do not put isavuconazonium in pill boxes or pill organizers. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
