			<Question qid="0001126-2" qtype="usage">How should Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Sodium polystyrene sulfonate comes as a suspension and as an oral powder for suspension to take by mouth. The suspension may also be given rectally as an enema. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is usually taken or used one to four times a day. Take or use sodium polystyrene sulfonate at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take or use sodium polystyrene sulfonate exactly as directed. Do not take or use more or less of it or take or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly. If you are taking sodium polystyrene sulfonate powder by mouth, mix the powder with 20 to 100 mL (about 1 to 3 ounces) of water or syrup as directed by your doctor. Measure carefully, using level teaspoonfuls of the powder. Use the mixture shortly after preparation; do not store beyond 24 hours. Do not heat sodium polystyrene sulfonate suspension or add it to heated foods or liquids. If you are receiving sodium polystyrene sulfonate as an enema, you will probably be given a cleansing enema before and after you receive this medication. Hold the sodium polystyrene sulfonate enema contents as long as possible, up to several hours. Do not use sorbitol along with sodium polystyrene sulfonate products. Serious problems have been reported when sorbitol was used with sodium polystyrene sulfonate.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001126-7" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature (unless told otherwise by your pharmacist) and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.

See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
