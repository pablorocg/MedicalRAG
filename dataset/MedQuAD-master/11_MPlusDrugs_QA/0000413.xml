			<Question qid="0000413-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Efavirenz and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Efavirenz is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Efavirenz is in a class of medications called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although efavirenz does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000413-2" qtype="usage">How should Efavirenz be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Efavirenz comes as a capsule and as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with plenty of water on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). Take efavirenz at around the same time every day. Taking efavirenz at bedtime may make certain side effects less bothersome. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take efavirenz exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets and capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If you are not able to swallow the medication whole, you can still take efavirenz by mixing the contents of the capsule with soft food and eating. To prepare each dose, open the capsule and sprinkle the contents onto 1-2 teaspoons of soft food in a small container. You can use soft foods such as applesauce, grape jelly, or yogurt. While sprinkling, be careful not to spill the contents of the capsule, or spread it in the air. Mix the medicine with the soft food. The mixture should look grainy but should not be lumpy. You must eat the medicine and soft food mixture within 30 minutes of mixing. When you are finished, add another 2 teaspoons of soft food to the empty container, stir, and eat to be sure that you have received the full dose of medication. Do not eat for the next 2 hours. If efavirenz is being given to a baby who can not yet eat solid foods, the contents of the capsule can be mixed with 2 teaspoons of room temperature infant formula in a small container. While emptying the capsule, be careful not to spill the contents, or spread it in the air. The mixture should look grainy but should not be lumpy. The mixture should be syringe fed to the baby within 30 minutes of mixing. When finished, add an additional 2 teaspoons of infant formula to the empty container, stir, and syringe feed to the baby to be sure that you have given the full dose of medication. Do not give the medication to the baby in a bottle. Do not feed the baby for the next 2 hours. Efavirenz controls HIV infection, but does not cure it. Continue to take efavirenz even if you feel well. Do not stop taking efavirenz without talking to your doctor. When your supply of efavirenz starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. If you miss doses or stop taking efavirenz, your condition may become more difficult to treat.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000413-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Efavirenz ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
