			<Question qid="0000149-2" qtype="usage">How should Bisacodyl be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Bisacodyl comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken the evening before a bowel movement is desired. Bisacodyl normally causes a bowel movement within 6 to 12 hours. Do not take bisacodyl more than once a day or for more than 1 week without talking to your doctor. Follow the directions on the package or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take bisacodyl exactly as directed. Frequent or continued use of bisacodyl may make you dependent on laxatives and cause your bowels to lose their normal activity. If you do not have a regular bowel movement after taking bisacodyl, do not take any more medication and talk to your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water; do not split, chew, or crush them. Do not take bisacodyl within 1 hour after drinking or eating dairy products.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000149-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Bisacodyl ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
