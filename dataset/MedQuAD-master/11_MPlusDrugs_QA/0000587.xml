			<Question qid="0000587-2" qtype="usage">How should Hydrocortisone Topical be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Hydrocortisone comes as ointment, cream, solution (liquid), spray, or lotion for use on the skin. Hydrocortisone topical is usually used one to four times a day for skin problems. Apply it at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription or product label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use hydrocortisone exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply it to other areas of your body or use it to treat other skin conditions unless directed to do so by your doctor. If your doctor has prescribed hydrocortisone for your condition, call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve in the first 2 weeks of your treatment. If you obtained hydrocortisone without a prescription (over the counter) and your condition does not improve within 7 days, stop using it and call your doctor. To use hydrocortisone topical, apply a small amount of ointment, cream, solution, spray, or lotion to cover the affected area of skin with a thin even film and rub it in gently. This medication is only for use on the skin. Do not let hydrocortisone topical get into your eyes or mouth and do not swallow it. Do not wrap or bandage the treated area unless your doctor tells you that you should. If you have psoriasis, your doctor may recommend an occlusive dressing. If you are applying hydrocortisone topical to a child's diaper area, do not cover the area with tight fitting diapers or plastic pants.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000587-6" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Hydrocortisone Topical ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not freeze it. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
