			<Question qid="0000393-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Dorzolamide and Timolol Ophthalmic and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>The combination of dorzolamide and timolol is used to treat eye conditions, including glaucoma and ocular hypertension, in which increased pressure can lead to a gradual loss of vision. Dorzolamide and timolol is used for patients whose eye condition has not responded to another medication. Dorzolamide is in a class of medications called topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Timolol is in a class of medications called topical beta blockers. Dorzolamide and timolol lowers pressure in the eye by decreasing the production of natural fluids in the eye.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000393-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Dorzolamide and Timolol Ophthalmic ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
