			<Question qid="0001236-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Trametinib and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Trametinib is used alone or in combination with dabrafenib (Tafinlar) to treat certain types of melanoma (a type of skin cancer). It is also used in combination with dabrafenib to prevent the return of a certain type of melanoma after surgery. Trametinib is also used in combination with dabrafenib to treat certain types of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and thyroid cancer. It is also used in combination with dabrafenib to treat certain types of solid tumors in adults and children 6 years of age older and to treat a certain type of glioma (a certain type of cancerous brain tumor) in children 1 year of age or older. Trametinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply.

			<Question qid="0001236-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Trametinib ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, away from moisture and light, and out of the reach of children. Do not place the tablets in other containers, such as daily or weekly pill boxes. Store it in a refrigerator, but do not freeze it. Do not remove the desiccant (small packet included with medication to absorb moisture) from your bottle. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
