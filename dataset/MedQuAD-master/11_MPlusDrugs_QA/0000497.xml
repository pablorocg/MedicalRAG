			<Question qid="0000497-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Fidaxomicin and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Fidaxomicin is used to treat diarrhea caused by  Clostridium difficile  ( C. difficile ; a type of bacteria that may cause severe or life-threatening diarrhea) in adults and children 6 months of age and older. Fidaxomicin is in a class of medications called macrolide antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria in the intestines. Fidaxomicin will not treat infections in any other part of the body. Antibiotics such as fidaxomicin will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000497-2" qtype="usage">How should Fidaxomicin be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Fidaxomicin comes as a tablet and as an suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food two times a day (approximately 12 hours apart) for 10 days. Take fidaxomicin at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fidaxomicin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Take the suspension bottle out of the refrigerator 15 minutes before preparing your dose. Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use an oral syringe to measure the correct amount of medication. Do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with fidaxomicin. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Take fidaxomicin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking fidaxomicin too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000497-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Fidaxomicin ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store the tablets at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Keep the suspension in the refrigerator, tightly closed, and dispose of any unused suspension after 12 days. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
