			<Question qid="0000321-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Daptomycin Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Daptomycin injection is used to treat certain blood infections or serious skin infections caused by bacteria in adults and children 1 year of age and older. Daptomycin injection is in a class of medications called cyclic lipopeptide antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as daptomycin injection will not work for treating colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Answer>Daptomycin injection comes as a powder to be added to fluid and injected into a vein by a doctor or nurse. It is usually given once a day. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection being treated and your response to daptomycin treatment. You may receive daptomycin injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you will be using daptomycin injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to infuse the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Ask your healthcare provider what to do if you have any problems infusing daptomycin injection. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with daptomycin injection. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor. Use daptomycin injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using daptomycin injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</Answer>
