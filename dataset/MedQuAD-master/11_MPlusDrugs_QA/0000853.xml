			<Question qid="0000853-2" qtype="usage">How should Neomycin, Polymyxin, and Bacitracin Ophthalmic be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ophthalmic neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin combination comes as an ointment to apply inside the lower lid of an infected eye. The ointment is usually applied to the eye every 3 to 4 hours for 7 to 10 days, as directed by your doctor. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin ophthalmic ointment exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your eye or eyelid infection should begin getting better during the first few days of treatment with neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin combination. If your symptoms do not go away or get worse, call your doctor. Continue to use neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin combination as directed, even if your symptoms improve. Do not stop using neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin combination without talking to your doctor. If you stop using this medication too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely cured and bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics. This medication is for use in the eye only. Do not let neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin combination get into your nose or mouth, and do not swallow it. Never share your tube of ophthalmic ointment, even with someone who was also prescribed this medication. If more than one person uses the same tube, infection may spread. To apply the eye ointment, follow these steps:
 Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water., Use a mirror or have someone else apply the ointment., Avoid touching the tip of the tube against your eye or anything else. The ointment must be kept clean., Tilt your head forward slightly., Holding the tube between your thumb and index finger, place the tube as near as possible to your eyelid without touching it., Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your cheek or nose., With the index finger of your other hand, pull the lower lid of your eye down to form a pocket., Place a small amount of ointment into the pocket made by the lower lid and the eye. A 1/2-inch (1.25-centimeter) strip of ointment usually is enough unless otherwise directed by your doctor., Gently close your eyes and keep them closed for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed., Replace and tighten the cap right away., Wipe off any excess ointment from your eyelids and lashes with a clean tissue. Wash your hands again., </Answer>

			<Question qid="0000853-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Neomycin, Polymyxin, and Bacitracin Ophthalmic ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
