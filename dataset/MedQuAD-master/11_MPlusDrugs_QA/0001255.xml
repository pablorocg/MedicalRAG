			<Question qid="0001255-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Trimethadione and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Trimethadione is used to control absence seizures (petit mal; a type of seizure in which there is a very short loss of awareness during which the person may stare straight ahead or blink his eyes and does not respond to others) when other medications will not work. Trimethadione is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by reducing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001255-2" qtype="usage">How should Trimethadione be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Trimethadione comes as a chewable tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken three or four times a day. Take trimethadione at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take trimethadione exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. The chewable tablets may be chewed or swallowed whole. Trimethadione may help to control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take trimethadione even if you feel well. Do not stop taking trimethadione without talking to your doctor. Your doctor probably will decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking trimethadione, your seizures may become worse. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with trimethadione and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001255-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Trimethadione ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store trimethadione chewable tablets in the refrigerator. Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org</Answer>
