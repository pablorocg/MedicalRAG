			<Question qid="0000534-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Fosamprenavir and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Fosamprenavir is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Fosamprenavir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although fosamprenavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000534-2" qtype="usage">How should Fosamprenavir be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Fosamprenavir comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day. The tablets can be taken with or without food. In patients at least 18 years old, the suspension should be taken without food. In patients younger than 18 years old, the suspension should be taken with food. To help you remember to take fosamprenavir, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fosamprenavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you are taking the suspension, shake it well before each use to mix the medication evenly. If you vomit less than 30 minutes after you take fosamprenavir, you should take another full dose of fosamprenavir. Fosamprenavir controls HIV infection but does not cure it. Continue to take fosamprenavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking fosamprenavir without talking to your doctor. If you miss doses or stop taking fosamprenavir, your condition may become more difficult to treat. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000534-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Fosamprenavir ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). The suspension may also be stored in the refrigerator, but do not freeze it. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
