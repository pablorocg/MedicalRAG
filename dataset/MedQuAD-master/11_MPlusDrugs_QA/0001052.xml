			<Question qid="0001052-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Ranibizumab Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ranibizumab injection products are used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD; an ongoing disease of the eye that causes loss of the ability to see straight ahead and may make it more difficult to read, drive, or perform other daily activities). Ranibizumab implant (Susvimo) is also used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration after at least two successful treatments with ranibizumab or a similar medication. Ranibizumab injection products are also used to treat myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV; a complication in near-sighted people where new blood vessels can grow in the back of the eye) and to treat macular edema after retinal vein occlusion (an eye disease caused by blockage of blood flow from the eye that leads to blurry vision and vision loss).  Ranibizumab injection (Lucentis) is also used to treat diabetic macular edema (an eye disease caused by diabetes that can lead to vision loss) and diabetic retinopathy (damage to the eyes caused by diabetes). Ranibizumab is in a class of medications called vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) antagonists. It works by stopping abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage in the eye(s) that may cause vision loss.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001052-2" qtype="usage">How should Ranibizumab Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Ranibizumab injection products come as a solution (liquid) to be injected into the eye by a doctor. It is usually given in a doctor's office every month. Your doctor may give you injections on a different schedule if that is best for you. Ranibizumab also comes as an implant to be inserted into the white part of your eye with a needle by a doctor in a medical office or clinic. The implant will need to refilled by injecting with more solution into it every 6 months by a doctor in a medical office or a clinic. Before you receive a ranibizumab injection product or implant, your doctor will clean your eye to prevent infection and numb your eye to reduce discomfort during the injection or implant. You may feel pressure in your eye when the medication is injected. After your injection, your doctor will need to examine your eyes before you leave the office. After having the implant inserted, you may be asked to keep your head above shoulder level for the rest of the day, which includes sleeping with 3 or more pillows under your head when you sleep. You will also be provided with an eye shield which should not be removed until told to do so by your doctor and should be worn for at least 7 nights after the implant was inserted. Do not push, rub or touch that part of the eye for 30 days after the implant insertion (underneath the eyelid in the upper and outer part of the eye) or 7 days after the implant is refilled. Ranibizumab controls certain eye conditions, but does not cure them. Your doctor will watch you carefully to see how well ranibizumab works for you. Talk to your doctor about how long you should continue treatment with ranibizumab.</Answer>
