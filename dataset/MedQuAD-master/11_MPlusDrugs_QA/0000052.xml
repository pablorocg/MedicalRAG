			<Question qid="0000052-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Amikacin Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Amikacin injection is used to treat certain serious infections that are caused by bacteria such as meningitis (infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) and infections of the blood, abdomen (stomach area), lungs, skin, bones, joints, and urinary tract. Amikacin injection is in a class of medications called aminoglycoside antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics such as amikacin injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000052-3" qtype="usage">How should Amikacin Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Amikacin injection comes as a liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) or intramuscularly (into a muscle) every 8 or 12 hours (two or three times a day). When amikacin is injected intravenously, it is usually infused (injected slowly) over a period of 30 to 60 minutes. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have. You may receive amikacin injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you will be receiving amikacin injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to use the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with amikacin injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Use amikacin injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using amikacin injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>
