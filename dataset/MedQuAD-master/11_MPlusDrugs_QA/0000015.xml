			<Question qid="0000015-1" qtype="indication">Who should get Aclidinium Oral Inhalation and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Aclidinium is used as a long term treatment to prevent wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways) such as chronic bronchitis (swelling of the air passages that lead to the lungs) and emphysema (damage to air sacs in the lungs). Aclidinium is in a class of medications called bronchodilators. It works by relaxing and opening the air passages to the lungs to make breathing easier.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000015-2" qtype="usage">How should Aclidinium Oral Inhalation be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Aclidinium comes as a dry powder in an inhalation device to inhale by mouth. It is usually inhaled twice a day, once every 12 hours. Inhale aclidinium at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Inhale aclidinium exactly as directed. Do not inhale more or less of it or inhale it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not use aclidinium to treat a sudden attack of wheezing or shortness of breath. Your doctor will prescribe a rescue medication to treat sudden attacks of symptoms. Keep this rescue medication with you at all times in case you have sudden difficulty breathing.  Your condition may worsen over time during your treatment with aclidinium. Do not take extra doses of aclidinium if this happens. Call your doctor or get emergency medical help if your breathing problems worsen, you need to use your rescue medication to treat sudden attacks more often, or your rescue medication does not relieve your symptoms as well as it did in the past. Aclidinium can help control your symptoms but does not cure COPD. You may notice some improvement in your symptoms the first day that you use aclidinium, but it may take longer for you to feel the full benefit of the medication. Continue to use aclidinium even if you feel well. Do not stop using aclidinium without talking to your doctor. Before you use your aclidinium inhalation device for the first time, read the manufacturer's directions for use carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use the device and practice using it while he or she watches. Be careful not to get aclidinium powder in your eyes. If you get the powder in your eyes, you may experience blurred vision and sensitivity to light. The aclidinium inhalation device does not need to be cleaned. If you want to clean the device, you may wipe the outside of the mouthpiece with a dry tissue or paper towel. Never use water to clean the device because you might damage the medication. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000015-8" qtype="storage and disposal">What should I know about storage and disposal of Aclidinium Oral Inhalation ?</Question>
			<Answer>Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Keep the device in the protective pouch and do not open the sealed pouch until you are ready to use the medication. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Do not store the medication on a surface that vibrates. Dispose of the inhalation device 45 days after you open it, when you see a zero in the dose indicator window, or when the device locks out, whichever comes soonest. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location &#8211; one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.  http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.</Answer>
