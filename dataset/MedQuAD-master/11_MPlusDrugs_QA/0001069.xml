			<Question qid="0001069-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about RimabotulinumtoxinB Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>RimabotulinumtoxinB injection may spread from the area of injection and cause symptoms of botulism, including severe or life-threatening difficulty breathing or swallowing. People who develop difficulty swallowing during their treatment with this medication may continue to have this difficulty for several months. They may need to be fed through a feeding tube to avoid getting food or drink into their lungs. Symptoms can occur within hours of an injection with rimabotulinumtoxinB or as late as several weeks after treatment. Symptoms may occur in people of any age being treated for any condition, but the risk is probably highest in children being treated for spasticity (muscle stiffness and tightness). Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had any swallowing problems or breathing problems, such as asthma or emphysema, or any condition that affects your muscles or nerves such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease; condition in which the nerves that control muscle movement slowly die, causing the muscles to shrink and weaken), motor neuropathy (condition in which the muscles weaken over time), myasthenia gravis (condition that causes certain muscles to weaken, especially after activity), or Lambert-Eaton syndrome (condition that causes muscle weakness that may improve with activity). If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: loss of strength or muscle weakness all over the body; double or blurred vision; drooping eyelids; difficulty swallowing, breathing, or speaking; or inability to control urination. Your doctor will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with rimabotulinumtoxinB injection and each time you receive treatment. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0001069-2" qtype="indication">Who should get RimabotulinumtoxinB Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>RimabotulinumtoxinB injection is used to relieve the symptoms of cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis; uncontrollable tightening of the neck muscles that may cause neck pain and abnormal head positions). RimabotulinumtoxinB injection is also used to treat chronic sialorrhea (ongoing drooling or excessive salivation). RimabotulinumtoxinB injection is in a class of medications called neurotoxins. When rimabotulinumtoxinB injection is injected into a muscle, it works by blocking the nerve signals that cause uncontrollable tightening and movement of the muscles. When rimabotulinumtoxinB is injected into saliva glands, it works by blocking the nerve signals that cause excessive saliva production.</Answer>
