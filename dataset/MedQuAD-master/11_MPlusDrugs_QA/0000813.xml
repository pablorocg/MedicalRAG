			<Question qid="0000813-1" qtype="important warning">What important warning or information should I know about Mitoxantrone Injection ?</Question>
			<Answer>Mitoxantrone should be given only under the supervision of a doctor with experience in the use of chemotherapy medications. Mitoxantrone may cause a decrease in the number of white blood cells in the blood. Your doctor will order laboratory tests regularly before and during your treatment to check whether the number of white blood cells in your body has decreased. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: fever, chills, sore throat, cough, frequent or painful urination, or other signs of infection. Mitoxantrone injection may cause damage to your heart at any time during your treatment or months to years after your treatment has ended. This heart damage can be serious and may cause death and can occur even in people without any risks for heart disease. Your doctor will examine you and perform certain tests to check how well your heart is working before beginning treatment with mitoxantrone and if you show any signs of heart problems. If you are using mitoxantrone injection for multiple sclerosis (MS; a condition in which the nerves do not function properly, causing symptoms such as weakness; numbness; loss of muscle coordination; and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control), your doctor will also perform certain tests before each dose of mitoxantrone injection and yearly after you have completed your treatment. These tests may include an electrocardiogram (ECG; test that records the electrical activity of the heart) and an echocardiogram (test that uses sound waves to measure your heart's ability to pump blood). Your doctor may tell you that you should not receive this medication if the tests show your heart's ability to pump blood has decreased. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had any type of heart disease or radiation (x-ray) therapy to the chest area. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking or have ever received certain cancer chemotherapy medications such as daunorubicin (Cerubidine), doxorubicin (Doxil), epirubicin (Ellence), or idarubicin (Idamycin), or if you have ever been treated with mitoxantrone in the past. The risk of heart damage may depend on the total amount of mitoxantrone given to a person over a lifetime, so your doctor will probably limit the total number of doses you receive if you are using this medication for MS. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: difficulty breathing, chest pain, swelling of the legs or ankles, or irregular or fast heartbeat. Mitoxantrone may increase your risk for developing leukemia (cancer of the white blood cells), especially when it is given in high doses or together with certain other chemotherapy medications. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using mitoxantrone injection.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000813-2" qtype="indication">Who should get Mitoxantrone Injection and why is it prescribed ?</Question>
			<Answer>Mitoxantrone injection is used to adults with various forms of multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and people may experience weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination, and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control) including the following: relapsing-remitting forms (course of disease where symptoms flare up from time to time), or, progressive relapsing (course of disease with occasional relapses), or, secondary progressive forms (course of disease where relapses occur more often).,  Mitoxantrone injection is also used together with steroid medications to relieve pain in people with advanced prostate cancer who did not respond to other medications. Mitoxantrone injection is also used with other medications to treat certain types of leukemia. Mitoxantrone injection is in a class of medications called anthracenediones. Mitoxantrone treats MS by stopping certain cells of the immune system from reaching the brain and spinal cord and causing damage. Mitoxantrone treats cancer by stopping the growth and spread of cancer cells.</Answer>

			<Question qid="0000813-3" qtype="usage">How should Mitoxantrone Injection be used and what is the dosage ?</Question>
			<Answer>Mitoxantrone injection comes as a liquid to be given intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a hospital or clinic. When mitoxantrone injection is used to treat MS, it is usually given once every 3 months for about 2 to 3 years (for a total of 8 to 12 doses). When mitoxantrone injection is used to treat prostate cancer, it is usually given once every 21 days. When mitoxantrone injection is used to treat leukemia, you will continue to receive this medication based on your condition and how you respond to the treatment. If you are using mitoxantrone injection for MS, you should know that it controls MS but does not cure it. Continue to receive treatments even if you feel well. Talk to your doctor if you no longer want to receive treatment with mitoxantrone injection. If you are using mitoxantrone injection for MS, ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</Answer>
