Many problems occur as a result of this increase of hormones, including: Menstrual irregularities, Infertility, Skin problems, such as acne and increased hair growth, Increased number of small cysts in the ovaries, Insulin resistance, with an increased risk of developing diabetes , ', 'dissimilarity': 4.102007}, 2: {'url': 'https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/polycysticovarysyndrome.html', 'question': 'What is (are) Polycystic Ovary Syndrome ?', 'answer': \"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) happens when a woman's ovaries or adrenal glands produce more male hormones than normal. One result is that cysts (fluid-filled sacs) develop on the ovaries. Women who are obese are more likely to have polycystic ovary syndrome.    Symptoms of PCOS include:      - Infertility    - Pelvic pain    - Excess hair growth on the face, chest, stomach, thumbs, or toes    - Baldness or thinning hair    - Acne, oily skin, or dandruff    - Patches of thickened dark brown or black skin          Women with PCOS are at higher risk of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Medicines can help control the symptoms. Birth control pills help women have normal periods, reduce male hormone levels, and clear acne. Other medicines can reduce hair growth and control blood pressure and cholesterol. There is no cure.

Women with this condition typically have high levels of  hormones called androgens, missed or irregular periods, and many small cysts in their ovaries. The cause of PCOS is unknown, but probably involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment for PCOS may involve birth control pills and medications for diabetes and infertility. Medicines called anti-androgens are also used to speed the growth of hair and clear acne.\", 'dissimilarity': 8.467911}, 4: {'url': 'https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000369.htm', 'question': 'What causes Polycystic ovary syndrome ?', 'answer': \"PCOS is linked to changes in hormone levels that make it harder for the ovaries to release fully-grown (mature) eggs. The reasons for these changes are unclear. The hormones affected are: Estrogen and progesterone, the female hormones that help a woman's ovaries release eggs , Androgen, a male hormone that is found in small amounts in women,  Normally, one or more eggs are released during a woman's cycle. This is known as ovulation. In most cases, this release of eggs occurs about 2 weeks after the start of a menstrual period.  In many women with PCOS, mature eggs are not released. Instead, they stay in the ovaries with a small amount of fluid (cyst) around them. The affected ovary may be slightly enlarged. There can be many of these. However, not all women with the condition will have ovaries with this appearance. Women with PCOS have cycles where ovulation does not occur every month which may contribute to  infertility  The other symptoms of this disorder are due to the high levels of male hormones. Most of the time, PCOS is diagnosed in women in their 20s or 30s. However, it may also affect teenage girls. The symptoms often begin when a girl's periods start. Women with this disorder often have a mother or sister who has similar symptoms. \", 'dissimilarity': 12.188087}, 5: {'url': 'https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000369.htm', 'question': 'What are the symptoms of Polycystic ovary syndrome ?', 'answer': 'Symptoms of PCOS include changes in the menstrual cycle, such as:  Not getting a period after you have had one or more normal ones during puberty ( secondary amenorrhea ), Irregular periods that may come and go, and be very light to very heavy,  Other symptoms of PCOS include: Extra body hair that grows on the chest, belly, face, and around the nipples, Acne on the face, chest, or back, Skin changes, such as dark or thick skin markings and creases around the armpits, groin, neck, and breasts ,  The development of male characteristics is not typical of PCOS and may indicate another problem.
