      "['If you have cancer, a clinical trial may be an option for you. A clinical trial is a study using people who agree to participate in new tests or treatments. Clinical trials help researchers know whether a new treatment works well and is safe. Trials are available for many cancers and all stages of cancer, not just advanced cancer.  If you join a trial, you may get treatment that can help you. Plus, you will help others to learn more about your cancer as well as new tests or treatments. There are many things to consider before joining a trial. Learn about why you might want to enroll in a clinical trial and where to find one.', 'Herbal remedies are plants used like a medicine. People use herbal remedies to help prevent or cure disease. They use them to get relief from symptoms, boost energy, relax, or lose weight.  Herbal remedies are not regulated or tested like medicines.  How can you know what you are getting and if it is useful? This guide can help you choose and use herbals safely.', 'A1C is a lab test that shows the average level of blood sugar (glucose) over the previous 3 months.

It can be passed down through families (inherited).\", 'Aarskog syndrome is a genetic disorder that is linked to the X chromosome. It affects mainly males, but females may have a milder form. The condition is caused by changes (mutations) in a gene called \"faciogenital dysplasia\" ( FGD1 ).', 'Symptoms of this condition include: Belly button that sticks out, Bulge in the groin or scrotum, Delayed sexual maturity, Delayed teeth, Downward  palpebral slant  to eyes (palpebral slant is the direction of the slant from the inner to outer corner of the eye), Hairline with a \"widow\\'s peak\", Mildly sunken chest (pectus excavatum), Mild to moderate cognitive problems, Mild to moderate short height which may not be obvious until the child is 1 to 3 years old, Poorly developed middle section of the face, Rounded face, Scrotum surrounds the penis (shawl scrotum), Short fingers and toes with mild webbing, Single crease in the palm of the hand, Small, broad hands and feet with short fingers and curved-in fifth finger, Small nose with nostrils tipped forward, Testicles that have not come down (undescended), Top portion of the ear folded over slightly, Wide groove above the upper lip, crease below the lower lip, Wide-set eyes with droopy eyelids , ', 'These tests may be done: Genetic testing for mutations in the  FGD1  gene, X-rays , ', 'Moving the teeth may be done to treat some of the abnormal dental features a person with Aarskog syndrome may have.', 'More information and support for people with Aarskog syndrome and their families can be found at: National Organization for Rare Disorders --  rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/aarskog-syndrome , NIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center --  rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/4775/aarskog-syndrome , ', 'Some people may have some mental slowness, but children with this condition often have good social skills. Some males may have problems with fertility.', 'These complications can occur: Changes in the brain, Difficulty growing in the first year of life, Poorly aligned teeth, Seizures, Undescended testicles, ', 'Call your health care provider if your child has delayed growth or if you notice any symptoms of Aarskog syndrome. Seek genetic counseling if you have a family history of Aarskog syndrome. Contact a genetic specialist if your provider thinks you or your child may have Aarskog syndrome.', 'Genetic testing may be available for people with a family history of the condition or a known mutation of the gene that causes it.\\n\\n', 'Aase syndrome is a rare disorder that involves  anemia  and certain joint and skeletal deformities.', 'Many cases of Aase syndrome occur without a known reason and are not passed down through families (inherited). However, some cases (45%) have been shown to be inherited. These are due to a change in 1 of 20 genes important for making protein correctly (the genes make ribosomal proteins). This condition is similar to Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and the two conditions should considered the same. A missing piece on chromosome 19 is found in some people with Diamond-Blackfan anemia. The anemia in Aase syndrome is caused by poor development of the bone marrow, which is where blood cells are formed.', 'Symptoms may include: Absent or small knuckles,  Cleft palate , Deformed ears, Droopy eyelids, Inability to fully extend the joints from birth, Narrow shoulders,  Pale skin , Triple-jointed thumbs, ', 'Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Tests that may be done include: Bone marrow biopsy ,  Complete blood count  (CBC),  Echocardiogram , X-rays, ', 'Treatment may involve blood transfusions in the first year of life to treat anemia.  A steroid medicine called prednisone has also been used to treat anemia associated with Aase syndrome. However, it should only be used after reviewing the benefits and risks with a provider who has experience treating anemias. A  bone marrow transplant  may be necessary if other treatment fails.', 'The anemia tends to improve with age.', 'Complications related to anemia include: Fatigue, Decreased oxygen in the blood, Weakness ,  Heart problems can lead to a variety of complications, depending on the specific defect. Severe cases of Aase syndrome have been associated with  stillbirth  or early death.', 'Genetic counseling is recommended if you have a family history of this syndrome and wish to become pregnant.', 'A swollen abdomen is when your belly area is bigger than usual.', 'The aorta is the main blood vessel that supplies blood to the abdomen, pelvis, and legs. An abdominal aortic  aneurysm  (AAA) occurs when an area of the aorta in the abdomen becomes very large or balloons out.', 'The exact cause of an aneurysm is unknown. It occurs due to weakness in the wall of the artery. Factors that can increase your risk of having this problem include: Smoking,  High blood pressure , Male sex, Genetic factors ,  An abdominal aortic aneurysm is most often seen in males over age 60 who have one or more risk factors. The larger the aneurysm, the more likely it is to break open or  tear . This can be life threatening.', 'Aneurysms can develop slowly over many years, often with no symptoms. Symptoms may come on quickly if the aneurysm expands rapidly, tears open or leaks blood within the wall of the vessel (aortic dissection). Symptoms of rupture include: Pain in the abdomen or back. The pain may be severe, sudden, persistent, or constant. It may spread to the groin, buttocks, or legs., Passing out.,  Clammy skin . \\n\\n , Dizziness., Nausea and vomiting.,  Rapid heart rate . \\n\\n ,  Shock . \\n\\n , ', 'Your health care provider will examine your abdomen and feel the pulses in your legs. The provider may find: A lump (mass) in the abdomen, Pulsating sensation in the abdomen, Stiff or rigid abdomen ,  Your provider may find this problem by doing the following tests: Ultrasound of the abdomen  when the abdominal aneurysm is first suspected,  CT scan of the abdomen  to confirm the size of the aneurysm, CTA (computed tomographic angiogram) to help with surgical planning ,  Any one of these tests may be done when you are having symptoms. You may have an abdominal aortic aneurysm that is not causing any symptoms. Your provider may order an ultrasound of the abdomen to screen for an aneurysm. Most men who are age 65 to 75, who have smoked during their life should have this test one time., Some men who are age 65 to 75, who have never smoked during their life may need this test one time. , ', 'If you have bleeding inside your body from an aortic aneurysm, you will need  surgery  right away. If the aneurysm is small and there are no symptoms: Surgery is rarely done., You and your provider must decide if the risk of having surgery is smaller than the risk of bleeding if you do not have surgery., Your provider will want to check the size of the aneurysm with ultrasound tests. The recommended frequency depends on the size of your aneurysm. Ask your provider what is best for you.,  Most of the time, surgery is done if the aneurysm is bigger than 2 inches (5 centimeters) across or growing quickly. The goal is to do surgery before complications develop. There are two types of surgery: Open repair  - A large cut is made in your abdomen. The abnormal vessel is replaced with a graft made of man-made material.,  Endovascular stent grafting  - This procedure can be done without making a large cut in your abdomen, so you may recover more quickly. This may be a safer approach if you have certain other medical problems or are an older adult. Endovascular repair can sometimes be done for a leaking or bleeding aneurysm. , ', 'The outcome is often good if you have surgery to repair the aneurysm before it ruptures.  When an abdominal aortic aneurysm  begins to tear  or ruptures, it is a medical emergency. Only about 1 in 5 people survive a ruptured abdominal aneurysm.', 'Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have pain in your belly or back that is very bad or does not go away.', 'To reduce the risk of aneurysms: Eat a heart-healthy diet, exercise, stop smoking (if you smoke), and reduce stress., If you have high blood pressure or diabetes, take your medicines as your provider has told you. ,  People over age 65 who have ever smoked should have a screening ultrasound done once. ', 'Open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is surgery to fix a widened part in your aorta. This is called an  aneurysm . The aorta is the large artery that carries blood from your heart to your belly (abdomen), pelvis, and legs. An  aortic aneurysm  is when part of this artery becomes too large or balloons outward.', 'Open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is surgery to fix a widened part in your aorta.

', 'Abdominal girth is the measurement of the distance around the abdomen at a specific point. Measurement is most often made at the level of the belly button (navel). Abdominal girth is used to diagnose and monitor the following: Buildup of fluid in the abdomen, most often caused by  liver failure ,  heart failure , or any cancer that has spread widely throughout the abdomen, Obesity, Buildup of intestinal gas, most often caused by blockage or  obstruction in the intestines , ', 'An abdominal mass is swelling in one part of the belly area (abdomen).', 'An abdominal mass is often found during a routine  physical exam . Most of the time, the mass develops slowly. You may not be able to feel the mass. Locating the mass helps your health care provider make a diagnosis. For example, the abdomen can be divided into four areas: Right-upper quadrant, Left-upper quadrant, Right-lower quadrant, Left-lower quadrant,  Other terms used to describe the location of abdominal pain or masses include: Epigastric -- center of the abdomen just below the rib cage, Periumbilical -- area around the belly button ,  The location of the mass and its firmness, texture, and other qualities can provide clues to its cause.', 'Several conditions can cause an abdominal mass: Abdominal aortic aneurysm  can cause a pulsating mass around the navel.,  Bladder distention  (urinary bladder over-filled with fluid) can cause a firm mass in the center of the lower abdomen above the pelvic bones. In extreme cases, it can reach as far up as the navel.,  Cholecystitis  can cause a very tender mass that is felt below the liver in the right-upper quadrant (occasionally).,  Colon cancer  can cause a mass almost anywhere in the abdomen.,  Crohn disease  or bowel obstruction can cause many tender, sausage-shaped masses anywhere in the abdomen.,  Diverticulitis  can cause a mass that is usually located in the left-lower quadrant., Gallbladder tumor can cause a tender, irregularly shaped mass in the right-upper quadrant.,  Hydronephrosis  (fluid-filled kidney) can cause a smooth, spongy-feeling mass in one or both sides or toward the back (flank area).,  Kidney cancer  can sometimes cause a smooth, firm, but not tender mass in the abdomen.,  Liver cancer  can cause a firm, lumpy mass in the right upper quadrant.,  Liver enlargement  (hepatomegaly) can cause a firm, irregular mass below the right rib cage, or on the left side in the stomach area.,  Neuroblastoma , a cancerous tumor often found in the lower abdomen can cause a mass (this cancer mainly occurs in children and infants).,  Ovarian cyst  can cause a smooth, rounded, rubbery mass above the pelvis in the lower abdomen.,  Pancreatic abscess  can cause a mass in the upper abdomen in the epigastric area.,  Pancreatic pseudocyst  can cause a lumpy mass in the upper abdomen in the epigastric area.,  Spleen enlargement  (splenomegaly) can sometimes be felt in the left-upper quadrant.,  Stomach cancer  can cause a mass in the left-upper abdomen in the stomach area (epigastric) if the  cancer  is large., Uterine  leiomyoma  (fibroids) can cause a round, lumpy mass above the pelvis in the lower abdomen (sometimes can be felt if the fibroids are large).,  Volvulus  can cause a mass anywhere in the abdomen.,  Ureteropelvic junction obstruction  can cause a mass in the lower abdomen. , ', 'An abdominal mass is often found during a routine  physical exam .
