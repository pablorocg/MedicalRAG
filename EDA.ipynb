      "Respuesta obtenida: Several conditions can cause an abdominal mass: Abdominal aortic aneurysm  can cause a pulsating mass around the navel.,  Bladder distention  (urinary bladder over-filled with fluid) can cause a firm mass in the center of the lower abdomen above the pelvic bones. In extreme cases, it can reach as far up as the navel.,  Cholecystitis  can cause a very tender mass that is felt below the liver in the right-upper quadrant (occasionally).,  Colon cancer  can cause a mass almost anywhere in the abdomen.,  Crohn disease  or bowel obstruction can cause many tender, sausage-shaped masses anywhere in the abdomen.,  Diverticulitis  can cause a mass that is usually located in the left-lower quadrant., Gallbladder tumor can cause a tender, irregularly shaped mass in the right-upper quadrant.,  Hydronephrosis  (fluid-filled kidney) can cause a smooth, spongy-feeling mass in one or both sides or toward the back (flank area).,  Kidney cancer  can sometimes cause a smooth, firm, but not tender mass in the abdomen.,  Liver cancer  can cause a firm, lumpy mass in the right upper quadrant.,  Liver enlargement  (hepatomegaly) can cause a firm, irregular mass below the right rib cage, or on the left side in the stomach area.,  Neuroblastoma , a cancerous tumor often found in the lower abdomen can cause a mass (this cancer mainly occurs in children and infants).,  Ovarian cyst  can cause a smooth, rounded, rubbery mass above the pelvis in the lower abdomen.,  Pancreatic abscess  can cause a mass in the upper abdomen in the epigastric area.,  Pancreatic pseudocyst  can cause a lumpy mass in the upper abdomen in the epigastric area.,  Spleen enlargement  (splenomegaly) can sometimes be felt in the left-upper quadrant.,  Stomach cancer  can cause a mass in the left-upper abdomen in the stomach area (epigastric) if the  cancer  is large., Uterine  leiomyoma  (fibroids) can cause a round, lumpy mass above the pelvis in the lower abdomen (sometimes can be felt if the fibroids are large).,  Volvulus  can cause a mass anywhere in the abdomen.,  Ureteropelvic junction obstruction  can cause a mass in the lower abdomen. , \n",

      "Respuesta obtenida: An abdominal mass is often found during a routine  physical exam . Most of the time, the mass develops slowly. You may not be able to feel the mass. Locating the mass helps your health care provider make a diagnosis. For example, the abdomen can be divided into four areas: Right-upper quadrant, Left-upper quadrant, Right-lower quadrant, Left-lower quadrant,  Other terms used to describe the location of abdominal pain or masses include: Epigastric -- center of the abdomen just below the rib cage, Periumbilical -- area around the belly button ,  The location of the mass and its firmness, texture, and other qualities can provide clues to its cause.\n",

      "Contenido del documento: What causes Lump in the abdomen ?\n",
      "Respuesta obtenida: Most often, a lump in the abdomen is caused by a hernia. An abdominal hernia occurs when there is a weak spot in the abdominal wall. This allows the internal organs to bulge through the muscles of the abdomen. A hernia may appear after you strain, or lift something heavy, or after a long period of coughing. There are several types of hernias, based on where they occur: Inguinal hernia appears as a bulge in the groin or scrotum. This type is more common in men than women., Incisional hernia can occur through a scar if you have had abdominal surgery.,  Umbilical hernia  appears as a bulge around the belly button. It occurs when the muscle around the navel does not close completely. ,  Other causes of a lump in the abdominal wall include: Hematoma (collection of blood under the skin after injury), Lipoma (collection of fatty tissue under the skin), Lymph nodes, Tumor of the skin or muscles   , \n",

      "Respuesta obtenida: An abdominal wall defect is an opening in the abdomen through which various abdominal organs can protrude. This opening varies in size and can usually be diagnosed early in fetal development, typically between the tenth and fourteenth weeks of pregnancy. There are two main types of abdominal wall defects: omphalocele and gastroschisis. Omphalocele is an opening in the center of the abdominal wall where the umbilical cord meets the abdomen. Organs (typically the intestines, stomach, and liver) protrude through the opening into the umbilical cord and are covered by the same protective membrane that covers the umbilical cord. Gastroschisis is a defect in the abdominal wall, usually to the right of the umbilical cord, through which the large and small intestines protrude (although other organs may sometimes bulge out). There is no membrane covering the exposed organs in gastroschisis.  Fetuses with omphalocele may grow slowly before birth (intrauterine growth retardation) and they may be born prematurely. Individuals with omphalocele frequently have multiple birth defects, such as a congenital heart defect. Additionally, underdevelopment of the lungs is often associated with omphalocele because the abdominal organs normally provide a framework for chest wall growth. When those organs are misplaced, the chest wall does not form properly, providing a smaller than normal space for the lungs to develop. As a result, many infants with omphalocele have respiratory insufficiency and may need to be supported with a machine to help them breathe (mechanical ventilation). Rarely, affected individuals who have breathing problems in infancy experience recurrent lung infections or asthma later in life. Affected infants often have gastrointestinal problems including a backflow of stomach acids into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux) and feeding difficulty; these problems can persist even after treatment of omphalocele. Large omphaloceles or those associated with multiple additional health problems are more often associated with fetal death than cases in which omphalocele occurs alone (isolated).  Omphalocele is a feature of many genetic syndromes. Nearly half of individuals with omphalocele have a condition caused by an extra copy of one of the chromosomes in each of their cells (trisomy). Up to one-third of people born with omphalocele have a genetic condition called Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Affected individuals may have additional signs and symptoms associated with these genetic conditions.  Individuals who have gastroschisis rarely have other birth defects and seldom have chromosome abnormalities or a genetic condition. Most affected individuals experience intrauterine growth retardation and are small at birth; many affected infants are born prematurely.  With gastroschisis, the protruding organs are not covered by a protective membrane and are susceptible to damage due to direct contact with amniotic fluid in the womb. Components of the amniotic fluid may trigger immune responses and inflammatory reactions against the intestines that can damage the tissue. Constriction around exposed organs at the abdominal wall opening late in fetal development may also contribute to organ injury. Intestinal damage causes impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract (peristalsis) in most children with gastroschisis. In these individuals, peristalsis usually improves in a few months and intestinal muscle contractions normalize. Rarely, children with gastroschisis have a narrowing or absence of a portion of intestine (intestinal atresia) or twisting of the intestine. After birth, these intestinal malformations can lead to problems with digestive function, further loss of intestinal tissue, and a condition called short bowel syndrome that occurs when areas of the small intestine are missing, causing dehydration and poor absorption of nutrients. Depending on the severity of the condition, intravenous feedings (parenteral nutrition) may be required.  The health of an individual with gastroschisis depends largely on how damaged his or her intestine was before birth. When the abdominal wall defect is repaired and normal intestinal function is recovered, the vast majority of affected individuals have no health problems related to the repaired defect later in life.\n",

      "Respuesta obtenida: Abdominal wall surgery is a procedure that improves the appearance of flabby, stretched-out abdominal (belly) muscles and skin. It is also called a tummy tuck. It can range from a simple mini-tummy tuck to more extensive surgery. Abdominal wall surgery is not the same as  liposuction , which is another way to remove fat. But, abdominal wall surgery is sometimes combined with liposuction.\n"
